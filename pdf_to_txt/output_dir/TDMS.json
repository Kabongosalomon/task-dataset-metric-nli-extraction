More importantly, our main goal is to tag papers using TDM triples from a taxonomy and to use these triples to organize papers. We adopt an approach similar to that used for some natural language inference (NLI) tasks (Bowman et al., 2015; Poliak et al., 2018) . Specifically, given a scientific paper in PDF format, our system first extracts the key contents from the abstract and experimental sections, as well as from the tables. Then, we identify a set of Task-Dataset-Metric (TDM) triples or Dataset-Metric (DM) pairs per paper. Our approach predicts if the textual context matches the TDM/DM label hypothesis, forcing the model to learn the similarity patterns between the text and various TDM triples. For instance, the model will capture the similarities between ROUGE-2 and \"Rg-2\". We further demonstrate that our framework is able to generalize to the new (unobserved) TDM triples at test time in a zero-shot TDM triple identification setup.",

Our work differs in the information extracted and consequently in what context and hypothesis information we model. Currently, one of the best performing NLI models (e.g., on the SNLI dataset) for three way classification is (Liu et al., 2019) . The authors apply deep neural networks and make use of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) , a novel language representation model. They reach an accuracy of 91.1%. Kim et al. (2019) exploit denselyconnected co-attentive recurrent neural network, and reach 90% accuracy. In our scenario, we generate pseudo premises and hypotheses, then apply the standard transformer encoder (Ashish et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019) to train two NLI models.",

The class labels are TDM triples and each paper can have multiple TDM labels as they may report results from different tasks, datasets, and with different metrics. For this classification we ignore instances with the 'Unknown' label in training because this does not form a coherent class (and would otherwise dominate the other classes). Then, for each paper, we extract bag-of-word features with tf-idf weights from the DocTAET representation described in Section 4. We train a multinomial logistic regression classifier implemented in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) using SAGA optimization (Defazio et al., 2014) .
