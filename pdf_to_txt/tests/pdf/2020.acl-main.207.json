In recent years, substantial improvements in NLP tools have been brought about by pretrained neural language models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; . While such models are widely used for representing individual words or sentences, extensions to whole-document embeddings are relatively underexplored. Likewise, methods that do use inter-document signals to produce whole-document embeddings (Tu et al., 2017; ) have yet to incorporate stateof-the-art pretrained LMs. Here, we study how to leverage the power of pretrained language models to learn embeddings for scientific documents.",

Our system, SPECTER, 2 incorporates inter-document context into the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models (e.g., SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) ) to learn document representations that are effective across a wide-variety of downstream tasks, without the need for any task-specific fine-tuning of the pretrained language model. We specifically use citations as a naturally occurring, inter-document incidental supervision signal indicating which documents are most related and formulate the signal into a triplet-loss pretraining objective. Unlike many prior works, at inference time, our model does not require any citation information. This is critical for embedding new papers that have not yet been cited. In experiments, we show that SPECTER's representations substantially outperform the state-SPECTER: Scientific Paper Embeddings using Citationinformed TransformERs of-the-art on a variety of document-level tasks, including topic classification, citation prediction, and recommendation.",

Inspired by the recent success of pretrained Transformer language models across various NLP tasks, we use the Transformer model architecture as basis of encoding the input paper. Existing LMs such as BERT, however, are primarily based on masked language modeling objective, only considering intra-document context and do not use any inter-document information. This limits their ability to learn optimal document representations. To learn high-quality documentlevel representations we propose using citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulate it as a triplet loss learning objective. We then pretrain the model on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not. We call our model SPECTER, which learns Scientific Paper Embeddings using Citation-informed Trans-formERs. With respect to the terminology used by Devlin et al. (2019) , unlike most existing LMs that are \"fine-tuning based\", our approach results in embeddings that can be applied to downstream tasks in a \"feature-based\" fashion, meaning the learned paper embeddings can be easily used as features, with no need for further task-specific fine-tuning. In the following, as background information, we briefly describe how pretrained LMs can be applied for document representation and then discuss the details of SPECTER.",

We partitioned the examples temporally into train (20K examples), validation (1K), and test (1K) sets. As is typical in clickthrough data on ranked lists, the clicks are biased toward the top of original ranking presented to the user. To counteract this effect, we computed propensity scores using a swap experiment (Agarwal et al., 2019). The propensity scores give, for each position in the ranked list, the relative frequency that the position is over-represented in the data due to exposure bias. We can then compute de-biased evaluation metrics by dividing the score for each test example by the propensity score for the clicked position.

We initialize the model from SciBERT pretrained weights (Beltagy et al., 2019) since it is the stateof-the-art pretrained language model on scientific text. We continue training all model parameters on our training objective (Equation 2). We perform minimal tuning of our model's hyperparameters based on the performance on the validation set, while baselines are extensively tuned. Based on initial experiments, we use a margin m=1 for the triplet loss. For training, we use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) following the suggested hyperparameters in Devlin et al. (2019) (LR: 2e-5, Slanted Triangular LR scheduler 10 (Howard and Ruder, 2018) with number of train steps equal to training instances and cut fraction of 0.1). We train the model on a single Titan V GPU (12G memory) for 2 epochs, with batch size of 4 (the maximum that fit in our GPU memory) and use gradient accumulation for an effective batch size of 32. Each training epoch takes approximately 1-2 days to complete on the full dataset. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility. 11",

On the other hand, on cocitation data our method is able to achieve the best results with nDCG of 94.8, improving over SGC with 2.3 points. Citeomatic also performs well on the citation tasks, as expected given that its primary design goal was citation prediction. Nevertheless, our method slightly outperforms Citeomatic on the direct citation task, while substantially outperforming it on co-citations (+2.0 nDCG). Finally, for recommendation task, we observe that SPECTER outperforms all other models on this task as well, with nDCG of 53.9.

The results are shown in the top four rows of Table 2 (for brevity, here we only report the average of the metrics from each task). We observe that removing the abstract from the textual input and relying only on the title results in a substantial decrease in performance. More surprisingly, adding authors as an input (along with title and abstract) hurts performance. 13 One possible explanation is that author names are sparse in the corpus, making it difficult for the model to infer document-level relatedness from them. As another possible reason of this behavior, tokenization using Wordpieces might be suboptimal for author names. Many author names are out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT and thus, they might be split into sub-words and shared across names that are not semantically related, leading to noisy correlation. Finally, we find that adding venues slightly decreases performance, 14 except on document classification (which makes sense, as we would expect venues to have high correlation 13 We experimented with both concatenating authors with the title and abstract and also considering them as an additional field.

The fact that SPECTER does not require inputs like authors or venues makes it applicable in situations where this metadata is not available, such as matching reviewers with anonymized submissions, or performing recommendations of anonymized preprints (e.g., on OpenReview). One design decision in SPECTER is to use a set of hard negative distractors in the citation-based finetuning objective. The fifth row of Table 2 shows that this is important-using only easy negatives reduces performance on all tasks. While there could be other potential ways to include hard negatives in the model, our simple approach of including citations of citations is effective. The sixth row of the table shows that using a strong general-domain language model (BERT-Large) instead of SciBERT in SPECTER reduces performance considerably.

We experiment with fine-tuning SciBERT on our tasks, and find this to be generally inferior to using our fixed representations from SPECTER. Specifically, we finetune SciBERT directly on task-specific signals instead of citations. To fine-tune on task-specific data (e.g., user activity), we used a dataset of coviews with 65K query papers, co-reads with 14K query papers, and co-citations (instead of direct citations) with 83K query papers. As the end tasks are ranking tasks, for all datasets we construct up to 5 triplets and fine-tune the model using triplet ranking loss. The positive papers are sampled from the most co-viewed (co-read, or co-cited) papers corresponding to the query paper. We also include both easy and hard distractors as when training SPECTER (for hard negatives we choose the least non-zero co-viewed (co-read, or co-cited) papers). We also consider training jointly on all task-specific training data sources in a multitask training process, where the model samples training triplets from a distribution over the sources. As illustrated in Table 3, without any additional final task-specific fine-tuning, SPECTER still outperforms a SciBERT model fine-tuned on the end tasks as well as their multitask combination, further demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of SPECTER embeddings. 15",

These works typically do not leverage the recent pretrained contextual representations and with a few exceptions such as the recent work by , they cannot generalize to unseen documents like our SPECTER approach. Context-based citation recommendation is another related application where models rely on citation contexts (Jeong et al., 2019) to make predictions. These works are orthogonal to ours as the input to our model is just paper title and abstract. Another related line of work is graphbased representation learning methods (Bruna et al., 2014; Kipf and Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017a,b; Wu et al., 2019a,b) . Here, we compare to a graph representation learning model, SGC (Simple Graph Convolution) (Wu et al., 2019a) , which is a state-of-the-art graph convolution approach for representation learning. SPECTER uses pretrained language models in combination with graph-based citation signals, which enables it to outperform the graph-based approaches in our experiments. SPECTER embeddings are based on only the title and abstract of the paper. Adding the full text of the paper would provide a more complete picture of the paper's content and could improve accuracy (Cohen et al., 2010; Lin, 2008; Schuemie et al., 2004) . However, the full text of many academic papers is not freely available. Further, modern language models have strict memory limits on input size, which means new techniques would be required in order to leverage the entirety of the paper within the models. Exploring how to use the full paper text within SPECTER is an item of future work.",

Following Hamilton et al. (2017a), we used SIF features as node representations, and applied SGC with a range of parameter k, which is the number of times the normalized adjacency is multiplied by the SIF feature matrix. Our range of k was 1 through 8 (inclusive), and was chosen with a validation set.

Following Devlin et al. (2019) we take the last layer hidden state corresponding to the [CLS] token as the aggregate document representation. 17 There were no other direct comparisons in Wu et al. (2019a) 17 We also tried the alternative of averaging all token representations, but this resulted in a slight performance decrease compared with the [CLS] pooled token. 9. Sentence BERT Sentence BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019 ) is a general-domain pretrained model aimed at embedding sentences. The authors fine-tuned BERT using a triplet loss, where positive sentences were from the same document section as the seed sentence, and distractor sentences came from other document sections. The model is designed to encode sentences as opposed to paragraphs, so we embed the title and each sentence in the abstract separately, sum the embeddings, and L2 normalize the result to produce a final 768-dimensional paper embedding. 18 During hyperparameter optimization we chose how to compute TF and IDF values weights by taking the following non-redundant combinations of scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer (Pedregosa et al., 2011) parameters: sublinear_tf, binary, use_idf, smooth_idf. There were a total of 9 parameter combinations. The IDF values were estimated on the training set. The other parameters were set as follows: min_df=3, max_df=0.75, strip_accents='ascii', stop_words='english', norm=None, lowercase=True. For training of fasttext, we used all default parameters with the exception of setting dimension to 300 and minCount was set to 25 due to the large corpus.",

Doc2Vec Doc2Vec is one of the earlier neural document/paragraph representation methods (Le and Mikolov, 2014) , and is a natural comparison. We trained Doc2Vec on our training subset using Gensim (\u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek and Sojka, 2010) , and chose the hyperparameter grid using suggestions from Lau and Baldwin (2016). The hyperparameter grid used:{'window': [5, 10, 15] , 'sample': [0, 10 ** -6, 10 ** -5], 'epochs': [50, 100, 200]}, for a total of 27 models. The other parameters were set as follows: vector_size=300, min_count=3, alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.0001, negative=5, dm=0, dbow=1, dbow_words=0. 3. Fasttext-Sum This simple baseline is a weighted sum of pretrained word vectors. We trained our own 300 dimensional fasttext embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017) on a corpus of around 3.1B tokens from scientific papers which is similar in size to the SciBERT corpus (Beltagy et al., 2019) . We found that these pretrained embeddings substantially outperform alternative off-theshelf embeddings. We also use these embeddings in other baselines that require pretrained word vectors (i.e., SIF and SGC that are described below). The summed bag of words representation has a number of weighting options, which are extensively tuned on a validation set for best performance.",
