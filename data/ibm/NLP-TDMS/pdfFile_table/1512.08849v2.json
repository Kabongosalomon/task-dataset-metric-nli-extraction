[{"caption":"Table 1: Experiment results in terms of accuracy. d is the dimension of the hidden states. |θ|W+M is the total number of parameters \n\nand |θ|M is the number of parameters excluding the word embeddings. Note that the five models in the last section were implemented \n\nby us while the other results were taken directly from previous papers. Note also that for the five models in the last section, we do \n\nnot update word embeddings so |θ|W+M is the same as |θ|M. The three columns on the right are the accuracies of the trained models \n\non the training data, the development data and the test data, respectively. \n\n","rows":["LSTM [ Bowman et al .
