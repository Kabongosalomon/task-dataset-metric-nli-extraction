The \nfew-shot learners are shown in four groups, depending on \nthe required base network size. We notice significant perfor-\nmance differences in general as the model size/complexity \nchanges. The first group uses the Conv4 network. Among \nthe methods here, our TapNet achieves best 1-shot and 5-\nshot accuracies. The methods in the second group, Transduc-\ntive Propagation Networks (TPN) and Relation Networks, \nare also based on the Conv4 embedder, but require additional \nnetworks for certain purposes. TPN utilizes an additional \nconvolutional block in the graph construction network, and \nRelation Networks use additional convolutional blocks in \n\nits relation module. Both these methods require signifi-\ncant extra learning efforts, compared to the learners relying \nmostly on the Conv4 base embedder. TPN achieves higher \n1-shot and 5 shot accuracies than the methods in the first \ngroup. The next group of methods uses ResNet-12-small. \nSNAIL and adaResNet are compared with TapNet. TapNet \nagain achieves the best 1-shot and 5-shot performance in \nthis group. The methods in the last group utilize ResNet-12, \nwhich is the largest network among the feature extractors \nconsidered in this work. For 1-shot results, our TapNet once \nagain provides the best accuracy. For 5-shot, TapNet\u0027s result \nis comparable to that of the best method, TADAM-TC, in \nthe sense that the confidence intervals overlap. In summary, \ngiven the same base network, TapNet consistently gives \neither the best accuracy or one comparable to the best in \n5-way miniImageNet classification among the well-known \nmethods. \n\n","rows":["MAML","TapNet ( Ours , ResNet - 12 )","TADAM - TC","Prototypical Nets","Relation Nets","TapNet ( Ours , ResNet - 12 - small )","adaResNet","Transductive Propagation Nets","Relation Networks","TADAM - α","TapNet ( Ours , Conv4 )","SNAIL"],"columns":["5 - shot","Table 3 .
