[{"caption":"Table 1. Parameter settings of the proposed MIN architecture used \nin the experiments. The convolutional kernel is defined as (height) \nx (width) x (number of units). Below, we present the stride (st.), \npadding (pad) and batch normalization (BN) of the convolution \nkernel. In maxout MLP layers (MMLP), k indicates the number of \nmaxout pieces used in one maxout unit. A softmax layer is applied \nto the last layer in the model (not shown here). The top row lists the \nparameters used in CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN, whereas the bottom \nrow lists those used in MNIST. \n\n","rows":["1x1x10 / st .","MMLP - 1 - 2","MMLP - 1 - 1","1x1x48 / st .","3x3x128 / st .","1x1x96 / st .","1x1x192 / st .","5x5x192 / st . 1 / pad","3x3x192 / st .","MMLP -
