[{"caption":"Table 2. For k-means, \nthe number of cluster centroids k is set to 702 and 751 on \ntarget data of Market-1501 and Duke respectively, which \nis the same as the number of identities of source train-\ning data. It is clear that HDBSCAN performs better than \nk-means and DBSCAN under either only using conserva-\ntive stage or whole PAST framework. For instance, using \nHDBSCAN can achieve mAP 54.26% and Rank-1 72.35% \nfor M→D task in PAST framework, which are 4.29% and \n3.41% higher than using k-means, and 1.19% and 0.45% \nthan using DBSCAN. In addition, we also observe that \nwhatever clustering method we use, our PAST framework \nalways outperforms only using conservative stage. This \nmeans that on the one hand, HDBSCAN clustering method \nhas more powerful effect in our framework; on the other \nhand, our PAST framework indeed provides improvement \nof feature representation on target domain. \n\n","rows":["for M→D task in PAST framework , which are","HDBSCAN can achieve mAP"],"columns":["tive stage or whole PAST framework .","It is clear that HDBSCAN performs better than","For instance , using","Table 2 .
