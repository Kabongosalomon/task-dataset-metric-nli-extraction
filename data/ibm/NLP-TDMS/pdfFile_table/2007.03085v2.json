[{"caption":"Table 1: Disparity results. We report results on Scene Flow and KITTI 2015. For Scene Flow, end point errors \n\n(EPE) and the 1-pixel and 3-pixel threshold error rates (1PE, 3PE) are reported. For KITTI 2015 we report \nthe standard metrics (using 3PE) for both Non-occluded and All pixels regions. Methods based on CDN are \nhighlighted in blue. Lower is better. The best result per column in in bold. Since the baselines are mostly trained \nwith uni-modal ground truths, we only show CDN with the same ground truths here for a fair comparison. \nScene Flow \nKITTI 2015 \nNon Occlusion 3PE \nAll Areas 3PE \nMethod \nEPE 1PE 3PE Foreground \nAll \nForeground \nAll \nMC-CNN [56] \n3.79 \n-\n-\n7.64 \n3.33 \n8.88 \n3.89 \nGC-Net [14] \n2.51 16.9 9.34 \n5.58 \n2.61 \n6.16 \n2.87 \nPSMNet [4] \n1.09 12.1 4.56 \n4.31 \n2.14 \n4.62 \n2.32 \nSegStereo [52] \n1.45 \n-\n-\n3.70 \n2.08 \n4.07 \n2.25 \nGwcNet-g [11] \n0.77 \n8.0 \n3.30 \n3.49 \n1.92 \n3.93 \n2.11 \nHD 3 -Stereo [53] \n1.08 \n-\n-\n3.43 \n1.87 \n3.63 \n2.02 \nGANet [57] \n0.84 \n9.9 \n-\n3.37 \n1.73 \n3.82 \n1.93 \nAcfNet [58] \n0.87 \n-\n4.31 \n3.49 \n1.72 \n3.80 \n1.89 \nStereo Expansion [51] \n-\n-\n-\n3.11 \n1.63 \n3.46 \n1.81 \nGANet Deep [57] \n0.78 \n8.7 \n-\n3.11 \n1.63 \n3.46 \n1.81 \nCDN-PSMNet \n0.98 \n9.1 \n3.99 \n4.01 \n2.12 \n4.34 \n2.29 \nCDN-GANet Deep \n0.70 \n7.7 \n2.98 \n2.79 \n1.72 \n3.20 \n1.92 \n\n","rows":["GANet Deep [ 57 ]","AcfNet [ 58 ]","Stereo Expansion [ 51 ]","GANet [ 57 ]","MC - CNN [ 56 ]","-","PSMNet [ 4 ]","CDN - GANet Deep","HD 3 - Stereo [ 53 ]","GC - Net [ 14 ]","CDN - PSMNet","SegStereo [ 52 ]","GwcNet - g [ 11 ]"],"columns":["All","KITTI 2015","Non Occlusion 3PE","1PE","3PE","Table 1 : Disparity results .
