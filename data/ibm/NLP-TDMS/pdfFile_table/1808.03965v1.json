The \nnumber of nodes reported represents how many nodes are used \nfor one iteration of training. The time reported here is the training \ntime for running 100 epochs using a single TITAN Xp GPU. \nIt can be seen that the actual numbers of nodes in the training \nsub-graph for the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets are 644, 442, \nand 354, respectively, which are far smaller than the maximum \nsub-graph size of 2,000. This indicates that the nodes in the Cora, \nCiteseer, and Pubmed datasets are sparsely connected. Specifically, \nstarting from several initial nodes with training labels, only a small \nset of nodes will be selected by expanding neighboring nodes to \nform connected sub-graphs. While these datasets are usually consid-\nered as a single large graph, the whole graph is actually composed \nof several separate sub-graphs that have no connection to each \nother. The sub-graph training strategy takes advantage of this fact \nand makes efficient use of the nodes with training labels. Since \nonly the initial nodes have training labels and all their connectivity \ninformation is included in the selected sub-graphs, the amount of \ninformation loss in the sub-graph training is minimized, resulting \nin negligible performance loss. This is demonstrated by comparing \nthe node classification accuracies of LGCN sub and LGCN whol e . \nAccording to the results, LGCN sub models only have a subtle per-\nformance loss of 0.5% on the Cora dataset, while yielding the same \nperformance on the Citeseer and Pubmed datasets, as compared to \nthe LGCN whol e models. \n","rows":["14s","sub","Accuracy","GCN","LGCN","Time","whol e"],"columns":["Citeseer","Pubmed","38s","58s","3327","442","354","1080s","644","30s","19717","2708","Cora","7s","4s"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"0.6%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327","4s","3327","30s","442"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"79.0%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["GCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.6s","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Time","14s"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327","4s","3327","30s","442"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.6%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327","4s","3327"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"79.5±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717","38s","19717"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717","38s","19717","1080s","354"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"83.8±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Cora","2708","7s","2708"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.5%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Cora","2708","7s","2708","58s","644"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717","38s","19717"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"73.0±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327","4s","3327"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"83.3±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Cora","2708","7s","2708","58s","644"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"70.3%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["GCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"81.5%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["GCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Cora","2708"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"79.5±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717","38s","19717","1080s","354"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.6s","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Time","14s"],"associatedColumns":["Pubmed","19717","38s","19717","1080s","354"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.5%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","whol e","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Cora","2708","7s","2708"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"73.0±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LGCN","sub","Accuracy"],"associatedColumns":["Citeseer","3327","4s","3327","30s","442"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
