Comparison with different ways of utilizing pseudo tar-\nget labels.The \"pseudo0\" means training with pseudo target labels \n(achieved by our initial clustering) directly. The \"pseudo1\" is to \nalternatively update target labels through clustering and minimize \nthe cross-entropy loss on pseudo labeled target data. In \"pseudo1\", \nthe cross-entropy loss on source data is also minimized. \n\n","rows":["CAN","pseudo1","pseudo0"],"columns":["A → D","Average","A → W","W → A","D → A"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"1.6","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["A → W"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"86.1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["Average"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"94.5±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["A → W"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.6","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["W → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["A → D"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"74.9","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo0"],"associatedColumns":["D → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["A → W"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"92.5±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["A → D"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"90.2±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["A → W"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"72.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo0"],"associatedColumns":["W → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"78.0±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["D → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["W → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"79.8","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo0"],"associatedColumns":["Average"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["A → D"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"86.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo0"],"associatedColumns":["A → D"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"77.0±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["W → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"75.7±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["D → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"95.0±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["A → D"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CAN"],"associatedColumns":["D → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"85.8","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo0"],"associatedColumns":["A → W"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["D → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"83.4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["Average"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"75.3±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["pseudo1"],"associatedColumns":["W → A"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
