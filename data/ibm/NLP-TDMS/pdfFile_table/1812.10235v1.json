The current Bi-model with a decoder \nshows the state-of-the-art performance on ATIS \nbenchmark dataset with 0.9% improvement on F1 \nscore and 0.5% improvement on intent accuracy. \nRemarks: \n1. It is worth noticing that the complexities of \nencoder-decoder based models are normally \nhigher than the models without using encoder-\ndecoder structures, since two networks are \nused and more parameters need to be updated. \nThis is another reason why we use two models \nwith/without using encoder-decoder structures to \ndemonstrate the new bi-model structure design. \nIt can also be observed that the model with a \ndecoder gives a better result due to its higher \ncomplexity. \n2.
