CIFAR-10 Benchmark: Ranking of Intermediate Test Error for DARTS. Architectures are retrained from \nscratch using the proxyless network and the error on the test set is reported after training for the indicated number of epochs. \nRank is calculated across the 4 trials. We also show the average over 10 seeds for the best architecture from the top trial for \nreference. \n † These results were run before we fixed the non-determinism in DARTS code (see Appendix A.2). \n\n","rows":["Reproduced","Darts †"],"columns":["100","10 Seeds","Avg","Epochs","600","Search","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min","Across"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"2.78±","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Across","10 Seeds","Avg"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.05","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.62","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Across","10 Seeds","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","Search","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","Search","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.77","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"7.51","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.92","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"7.67","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","Search","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","Search","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"8.38","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"7.63","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.00","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Reproduced"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","600","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.12","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Across","10 Seeds","Avg"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Darts †"],"associatedColumns":["Epochs","100","Trial Value Rank Value Rank Min"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]},{"caption":"Table 8.
