[{"caption":"Table 1: Average running time for the non-fine tuned models from figure 5. Each entry represents average time per \nepoch / average total training time. For the first four datasets, each of the models has a parameter budget âˆ¼ 100k \nand was run on a Tesla T4 (15GB GPU). The avg increase row is the average of the relative running time of all rows \ncompared to the mean row, with a negative value meaning a faster running time. \n\n","rows":["mean dx","mean av"],"columns":["avg increase","mean dx","3 . 95s / 1432s","mean","Aggregators","3 . 89s / 1079s","mean av","117 . 1s / 12834s","CIFAR10","ZINC","98 . 4s / 8405s","4 . 23s / 1360s"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","98 . 4s / 8405s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1av","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","98 . 4s / 8405s","mean av","117 . 1s / 12834s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1av","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","98 . 4s / 8405s","mean av","117 . 1s / 12834s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1av","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","98 . 4s / 8405s","mean av"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1dx","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s","3 . 89s / 1079s","avg increase","CIFAR10","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","98 . 4s / 8405s","mean av"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1dx","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean dx"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1av","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["mean av"],"associatedColumns":["ZINC","Aggregators","mean","mean dx","4 . 23s / 1360s","mean av","3 . 95s / 1432s"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
