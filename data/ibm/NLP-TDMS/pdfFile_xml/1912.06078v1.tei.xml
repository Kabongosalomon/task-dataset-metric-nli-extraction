<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One common method for stabilizing robots after a push is the Instantaneous Capture Point, however, this has the fundamental limitation of assuming constant height. Although there are several works for balancing bipedal robots including height variations in 2D, the amount of literature on 3D models is limited. There are optimization methods using variable Center of Pressure (CoP) and reaction force to the ground, although they do not provide the physical region where a robot can step and require a precomputation for the analysis. This work provides the necessary and sufficient conditions to maintain balance of the 3D Variable Height Inverted Pendulum (VHIP) with both, fixed and variable CoP. We also prove that the 3D VHIP with Fixed CoP is the same as its 2D version, and we generalize controllers working on the 2D VHIP to the 3D VHIP. We also show the generalization of the Divergent Component of Motion to the 3D VHIP and we provide an alternative motion decomposition for the analysis of height and CoP strategies independently. This allow us to generalize previous global feedback controllers done in the 2D VHIP to the 3D VHIP with a Variable CoP.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are presented as follows:</p><p> Provide a transformation that shows the equivalency of the 3D VHIP with a fixed CoP with its analogous 2D case for 0-step capturability</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Balancing a robot is an important topic in Humanoid Robotics. Avoiding falling prevents us from the costs of repair or replacement of damaged components. One of the common approaches is the use of reduced-order models for the robot, using only the Center of Mass (CoM) for the model. Some classical simplifications are to keep constant the angular momentum, the height of the CoM, and the Center of Pressure (CoP), as well as assuming a flat terrain. This model is known as the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with a push recovery analysis tool known as the Capture Point <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Capture Point is used mainly for balance, analysis and control, and its connection with walking is done by performing some strategies of capturability. One way where 2D works had been extended to 3D for walking is to consider the decoupled systems on each spatial component. Following this path, the concept of the Capture Point had been extended to the well-known Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, highly used in walking, where usually the robot plans a trajectory using only this point in the space. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Grizzle et al. perform lateral stabilization for walking by enforcing the lateral average velocity to 0 as a constraint in an optimization problem considering a decoupled lateral-sagittal system. Here, we use these decoupling ideas for the balance control of the 3D VHIP with Fixed CoP balance as multiple 2D VHIPs.</p><p>Recently, new approaches and works arise by removing some of the classical simplifications on the LIP model. Systems modeling angular momentum have been defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and angular momentum had been included also in the planning stage of walking using the DCM approach, considering still a linear model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>There are also works considering the full centroidal dynamics including height variations, but the main difficulty in these is due to the non-convexity of the equations of motion, which requires too long solve time to be implemented in hardware applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Relaxations on the constraints can turn the problem into a convex one <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and it is possible also to find inner and outer bounds of the controllable states via Sum-Of-Squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>A more analytical approach was given by <ref type="bibr">Koolen et. al.</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where they found the closed form solution for the capture region using the 2D VHIP, and provide feedback control laws. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, considering input limits, authors show an alternative way to control the 2D VHIP using sliding mode and feedback linearization in a DCM that models height variations. However, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> do not cover the 3-Dimensional case and assume a constant CoP.</p><p>Ramos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> found some possible capture points on a variable-height model using an iteration algorithm based on bisection. With this, they show that the 3D case can be solved as a 2D case defined in the direction of the push under fixed CoP and angular momentum.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Caron et. al. remove the assumption of fixed CoP for the stabilization of the 3D VHIP. They use optimization to compute the force that must be applied to the ground and the trajectory of the CoP in the contact surface, but they do not provide the admissible physical region allowed for balance or, equivalently, where to step. Also, their analysis is mostly based on time and their boundedness condition requires first to compute trajectories, without considering the analytical approach from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The first analysis on height variations strategies using components of motion was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where authors define the called Time-Varying Divergent Component of Motion which allows for height variations. That component was analyzed again in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, using still a time-based focus.</p><p>In this work, we extend the analytical approach of height variations done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> to the analysis of height and CoP strategies on the 3D VHIP without using time-based analysis, but using a state-space analysis. Also, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we will define the DCM for the 3D VHIP as a function of the state variables, allowing feedback control on the model. We will also show the connection with the DCM in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Additionally, our work does not restrict the new DCM to a flat terrain: we only use a flat foot.  Provide feedback control laws into the last Decomposition without performing any trajectory optimization for balance in the whole physically possible region of stabilization.</p><p>First, we will present the dynamical system we are working on, the 3D VHIP (Section II). We will then show the first contribution relate with the 3D VHIP with Fixed CoP in Section III. In Section IV we will provide the second contribution of this paper: the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the 3D VHIP with Variable CoP. n Section V we will study the motion decomposition and global feedback control of the 3D VHIP. Last three contributions are in this section. Finally, we will discuss the results and we will give some open problems in Section VI.</p></div>

(3) is the unilateral contact restriction.</p><p>By enforcing constant angular momentum ̇= 0 it can be shown that = 0 and that is parallel to − .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Ballistic trajectory.</head><p>A special trajectory of the 3D VHIP is the ballistic trajectory introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which is defined as the resultant trajectory when the robot apply a force = 0. From (6) we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5"> ( ) = +̇+ 2  </formula><p>In other words, ballistic trajectory is the curve described by object in free fall with a given initial velocity and position. We can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> the ballistic trajectory as an inverted parabola in blue.</p><p>In this paper, we will be referring by region "below the ballistic trajectory" as the shaded region in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. Also, Let us define the ballistic line as the projection of the ballistic trajectory onto the XY plane (Plotted in green). are considered "below the ballistic trajectory". Likewise, points belonging to the dashed line are considered "above the ballistic trajectory". We also say that in this case the foot has step "over the ballistic line" because its projection to the XY plane contains points of the ballistic line. The full plane containing the ballistic trajectory is the "ballistic plane".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. 3D VHIP FIXED COP</head><p>Models using a fixed Center of Pressure are known as "point-foot models".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Equivalence of the stable 3D VHIP to a 2D VHIP</head><p>The dynamical system in the ballistic line can be reduced to a simple 2D VHIP and we can apply a control law like <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, so we can stabilize the system with already existant feedback control laws.</p></div>

Let us change the variable of the sagittal plane to 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13"> 2 = 0 0  </formula><p> Then, by using (12) when = 0 in the derivative of (17) we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">̇2 = 0 0̇=̇0 0̇  ̈2 = 0 0 = 2  </formula><p>This yields the new sagittal scaled system ( 2 , ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15"> [̈2 = 2 = − ] ; ≥ 0 </formula><p>And the initial condition holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16"> 2 (0) = 0 ,̇2(0) =̇0 </formula><p>Note that this sagittal scaled system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(21)</ref> is the same as the lateral 2D VHIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Due to the existence and uniqueness theorem of differential equations, we have 2 ( ) = ( ), supposing that ( ) is Lipschitz continuous. Although some control laws can be piecewise ̇ ( ) continuous (and not Lipschitz continous), the result of a unique solution still persist as long as ( ) is not multivalued (impossible for a scalar value).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 1: The 3D VHIP with Fixed CoP only admits a 1D region as the Capture Region, and it is the intersection of the 2D region below the ballistic trajectory with the solid ground.</head><p>Using Lemma 1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we know that the necessary and sufficient condition for balance is that the CoP must be placed below the ballistic trajectory in the 2D VHIP.

We have the following dynamical system as the 3D VHIP with variable CoP:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18"> [̈= ( − ) = ( − ) = ( − ) − ] , ≥ 0, ∈   where = ( , , )</formula><p>are the coordinates of the Center of Pressure of the foot.

Necessary and sufficient condition for balance</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition for balance was given as a boundedness condition. The main problem with this approach is that we need first to find a trajectory for the normalized force ( ) and the trajectory of the Center of Pressure ( ). Using that approach, it is impossible to know if a given state is capturable or not without solving an optimization problem to try to find the mentioned trajectories.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, authors defined as the time that the ballistic trajectory takes to reach the base of the Center of Pressure, and as the z-axis intercept of the ballistic trajectory in the 2D VHIP with Fixed CoP model.

In consequence, there must not exist any plane dividing the region below the ballistic trajectory and the Contact Surface . This implies finally that those regions must always intersect as a necessary condition of capturability. Now let us see why this is sufficient for capturability. You can always find a point ∈ such that the ballistic trajectory is over it. The z-intercept of the ballistic trajectory in a frame of coordinates centered on will be positive, and also is forward in the direction of the initial velocity. These statements are condensed into the following two inequalities in the new frame, recapping (26) and <ref type="formula">(27)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">&gt; 0 &gt; 0</formula><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, this is enough for balance, so the system is controllable. We can apply a control law based on Orbital Energy and the system will be stable because <ref type="formula">(26)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(27)</ref> are held. This shows sufficiency of Lemma 3. □ <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Trajectories obtained using feedback control laws showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows an example of the sufficiency of Lemma 3. We chose a ∈ below the Ballistic Trajectory, and we apply the controllers showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> by just fixing the CoP at . Although this is not using variations on the CoP, it is enough to illustrate sufficiency of the Lemma 3.</p><p>Obviously, fixing the CoP is only one way to control the robot, and it is not considering the possible advantages of use a variable CoP. In Section V we will show a way to control in feedback form the 3D VHIP, without using any time function or open loop control.</p><p>We will now highlight some corollaries consequences of Lemma 3.  We can also intuitively realize that the CoM is pushed away from the ballistic line, because the force applied will always be in the opposite direction of the side where the foot is, so the robot will enter to the other side and we will be unable to drive it to the contact surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 3:</head><p>When the foot is placed over the ballistic line projected to the XY plane, but above the ballistic trajectory, the system is uncontrollable. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref> shows an example of this case. In terms of (27) and (28), the condition &gt; 0 (CoP above the ballistic trajectory) can never be achieved in any point in . Because there exists a plane separating the foot and the ballistic trajectory Lemma 3 cannot be hold as the ballistic trajectory will be always pushed away from that plane. This means then that the CoM will never go over the Contact Surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 4:</head><p>In the 3D VHIP with variable CoP, the contact surface must have at least one point placed forward in the direction of the push.

Small Extension to 1-step capturability</head><p>Although this paper is focused primarily in 0-step recovery, there is one implication that can be useful for the last step in the 1-step recovery. We have considered the contact surface as the region where you can place the CoP as desired (in single support, it is only one foot). In double support you can place the CoP in any place of the polygonal support or the convex hull of the projection to the XY plane of the feet, so this will be our new Contact Surface. Note that for the proof of Lemma 3 we did not used the shape of the terrain: it can be flat, discontinuous or roughly. Also, we have not used a planar , Lemma 3 is applicable to any convex region , obtained for example, as the geometrical outer approximation of the region where you can place a point of the more general Centroidal Momentum of Pressure in a Multi-contact 3D VHIP with non-coplanar points. In this case, we no longer require the foot stepping over the ballistic line, but we require the new Contact Surface i.e. the convex hull of the feet (also called support polygon), containing the ballistic line as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref> shows.</p><p>Three non-valid steps are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref>, the one in the top left represents a step failing Corollary 2, the Contact Surface does not cross the ballistic line. The step in the top right is not holding Corollary 3 because the ballistic line crosses the support region but does not contain a point above the ballistic trajectory. The invalid step of the bottom fails Corollary 4, although its contact surface crosses the projection of the ballistic line, it is placed "forward" the transversal line of the initial conditions. The solid red line foot placement meets conditions of Lemma 3, so the system can be balance.</p><p>Note that the previous placements were based on the classical Instantaneous Capture Point (ICP). This time the ICP is not playing an important role here, but it will be a good indicator where to step. Our reference for the conditions for balance this time is the point where the ballistic trajectory crosses the ground. These statements will be detailed in Section V. Once a stable step has been planned (like the red continuous line one), a control law based on the 2D VHIP can be performed. In this case we can proceed to fix the CoP in the path of the ballistic line and apply a feedback control law like <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or we can also perform an optimization-based controller like <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (with the drawback of getting a timebased controller). a fixed CoP possibility for a 2D VHIP. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Initialization of variables and control</head><p>The selection of the initial state of , 0 , is an important stage in the control design. This will define the initial positions of the gDCM and the CBP.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> authors design feedback control laws for system. Also in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> a feedback control law was designed over the variables ( , ) which are actually a transformation of ( , ). In both cases 0 should be initialized as − 0 0 . But this time there is no 0 = ( ,̇), as we have seen in subsection D. Because of this, we can initialize 0 almost anywhere.</p><p>Remember that attracts and it is repelled from as long as is positive. If eventually becomes negative, then the dynamics are inverted: will repel and it will be attracted to . Furthermore it is easy to see that &lt; 0 is an invariant set, because in the boundary = 0, we always have ̇= −1. So, if becomes negative, then it will never be positive again. The same situation happens with considering &gt; 0: if &lt; 0, then ̇&lt; 0 according to (73). This is equivalent to Lemma 1 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in the equivalent 2D VHIP with Fixed CoP.</p><p>If becomes negative the system can still be controlled, but if we use the negative value of then we should take into account the inversion of the dynamics. The consequence is that we need to use all subsystems for control (73), (74) and (75), which goes against the use of the DCM as the unstable part of the Dynamics and the CoM as the stable part. For that reason, we will disregard the case &lt; 0.</p><p>We are going to initialize the variable such that the subsystems (73) and (74) can be controlled. When &gt; 0, subsystem (74) can be controlled if and only if = is inside the Contact Surface . Otherwise it will be pushed away from the foot, which corresponds with the works done on the classical 3D-DCM Linear model. So, we need an initial value 0 &gt; 0 that produces an initial CBP ( 0 ) via 0 = ( 0 ) where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_58"> ∈    0 &gt; 0 </formula><p>Equivalently, in terms of the gDCM using (69) we have the requirements:</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">0 ∈ 0 &gt; 2 0 2</formula><p>Let us note how (77) and (78) remind us the necessary and sufficient conditions for balance given by Lemma 3.

Because is a convex region and using (77), there are two points where ( ) intercepts the boundary in the x-y plane, which we will call 1 and 2 (with 2 &gt; 1 ). (78) imposes a maximum value on 0 which is the time that the ballistic trajectory takes to cross the ground (or the extension of the plane containing the foot). We will call it .

This is true when ̇= 0: in that case, we can keep a constant height and achieve balance. When ̇≠ 0, the system can be balance following a linear CoM trajectory. When a final desired height is specified, then height variations will be needed, but the initialization 0 = is still highly reasonable for this first approach.

For now, we consider a disturbance as an instantaneous change of the state variables. In that sense, an impulsive push changes instantaneously the velocity of the CoM. The critical variables for stability are and , or equivalently, , and . In theory the variable can never be disturbed, because it is a virtual state running on the controller, but integration errors can occur, which we will ignore. So the variables − , − will instantaneously change after an impulsive push.

Simulations were done using feedback over this "normalized" orientation of the foot (93). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 7-12</ref> are plotted in the original frame of coordinates, so analysis and control showed in subsections E, F and G are still valid in a non-horizontal Contact Surface after the linear change of variables (92).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>We have given some conditions and requirements for the 3D VHIP with 0-step capturability, but more work should be done. We are not taking into account the kinematic constraints: When the foot is close to the ballistic trajectory itself (low values of ) the robot tends to let the CoM fall and CoM doesn't stop falling until the very last moment. In a similar way, when the foot is close to the vertical projection of the CoM (low values of ), the robot tends to apply an extremely high height variation. Both are kinematic problems: in the first case the robot will crash into the ground, and in the second case the robot will jump. Actuation limits are also a big issue, although we have used the feedback controller from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> considering ≤ , it is not limiting directly the force. Friction limits are also not taken into account. Although friction apparently is not so difficult to handle in the single contact case (the ballistic trajectory eventually enters to the friction cone of the foot, except in extreme cases), it is a hard case to solve when it is combined with limited actuation. Also, the multi-contact friction case is much more complicated.</p><p>An interesting topic of research is the extension of these analytical methods and feedback based controls to the walking problem. One approach to solve this is to study the N-step capturability, and perform continuously a 1-step or 2-step capturability. Another approach is to predefine the DCM trajectory and find feedback control laws for tracking this reference. Although a TV-LQR control from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> can be used straightforward in a linearization around the trajectory, it is interesting to find control laws that are able to track the DCM trajectories in the whole possible region of stability.</p><p>A last open problem is the inclusion of a variable angular momentum. This then requires the control of the Full Centroidal Dynamics, with this work being an inner approximation where the equation ̇= 0 is held.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In conclusion, with either a fixed or variable CoP, the robot always must step in the ballistic line to be 0-step capturable. Otherwise, the robot will fall or it will need to use n-step recovery.</p><p>In any case, the robot can just Fix the CoP in a place below the ballistic trajectory and it can perform a 2D VHIP strategy for recovery in the ballistic plane.</p><p>If the robot wants to make use of the Variable CoP, the motion can be decomposed into two different analyses: one more intuitive using the gDCM, or another splitting that divides the analysis into height strategies and CoP strategies. We also provide a way to reinitialize the Augmented 3D VHIP in the event that a disturbance produces the robot to fall outside the region of stability. Finally, we provided a small generalization of the bounded case ≤ and we show that the present analysis works in any orientation of the foot using a linear transformation to become it horizontal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>3D VHIP model</figDesc></figure>
