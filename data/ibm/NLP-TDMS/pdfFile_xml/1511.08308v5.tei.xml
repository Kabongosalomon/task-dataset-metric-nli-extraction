<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally required large amounts of knowledge in the form of feature engineering and lexicons to achieve high performance.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel neural network architecture that automatically detects word-and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature engineering. We also propose a novel method of encoding partial lexicon matches in neural networks and compare it to existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given only tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings, our system is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and surpasses the previously reported state of the art performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.13 F1 points. By using two lexicons constructed from publicly-available sources, we establish new state of the art performance with an F1 score of 91.62 on CoNLL-2003 and 86.28 on OntoNotes, surpassing systems that employ heavy feature engineering, proprietary lexicons, and rich entity linking information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named entity recognition is an important task in NLP. High performance approaches have been dominated by applying CRF, SVM, or perceptron models to hand-crafted features <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Luo et al., 2015)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> proposed an effective neural network model that requires little feature engineering and instead learns important features from word embeddings trained on large quantities of unlabelled text -an approach made possible by recent advancements in unsupervised learning of word embeddings on massive amounts of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> and neural network training algorithms permitting deep architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately there are many limitations to the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>. First, it uses a simple feed-forward neural network, which restricts the use of context to a fixed sized window around each word -an approach that discards useful long-distance relations between words. Second, by depending solely on word embeddings, it is unable to exploit explicit character level features such as prefix and suffix, which could be useful especially with rare words where word embeddings are poorly trained. We seek to address these issues by proposing a more powerful neural network model.</p><p>A well-studied solution for a neural network to process variable length input and have long term memory is the recurrent neural network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goller and Kuchler, 1996)</ref>. Recently, RNNs have shown great success in diverse NLP tasks such as speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Graves et al., 2013)</ref>, machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cho et al., 2014)</ref>, and language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mikolov et al., 2011)</ref>. The long-short term memory (LSTM) unit with the forget gate allows highly non-trivial long-distance dependencies to be easily learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gers et al., 2000)</ref>. For sequential labelling tasks such as NER and speech recognition, a bi-directional LSTM model can take into account an effectively infinite amount of context on both sides of a word and eliminates the problem of limited context that applies to any feed-forward model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Graves et al., 2013)</ref>. While LSTMs have been studied in the past for the NER task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hammerton (2003)</ref>, the lack of computational power (which led to the use of very small models) and quality word embeddings limited their effectiveness.</p><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have also been investigated for modeling character-level information, among other NLP tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Labeau et al. (2015)</ref> successfully employed CNNs to extract character-level features for use in NER and POS-tagging respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> also applied CNNs to semantic role labeling, and variants of the architecture have been applied to parsing and other tasks requiring tree structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blunsom et al., 2014)</ref>. However, the effectiveness of character-level CNNs has not been evaluated for English NER. While we considered using character-level bi-directional LSTMs, which was recently proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ling et al. (2015)</ref> for POStagging, preliminary evaluation shows that it does not perform significantly better than CNNs while being more computationally expensive to train.</p><p>Our main contribution lies in combining these neural network models for the NER task. We present a hybrid model of bi-directional LSTMs and CNNs  that learns both character-and word-level features, presenting the first evaluation of such an architecture on well-established English language evaluation datasets. Furthermore, as lexicons are crucial to NER performance, we propose a new lexicon encoding scheme and matching algorithm that can make use of partial matches, and we compare it to the simpler approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>. Extensive evaluation shows that our proposed method establishes a new state of the art on both the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task and the OntoNotes 5.0 datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>Our neural network is inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, where lookup tables transform discrete features such as words and characters into continuous vector representations, which are then concatenated and fed into a neural network. Instead of a feed-forward network, we use the bi-directional long-short term memory (BLSTM) network. To induce character-level features, we use a convolutional neural network, which has been successfully applied to Spanish and Portuguese NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Santos et al., 2015)</ref> and German POS-tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Labeau et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sequence-labelling with BLSTM</head><p>Following the speech-recognition framework outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graves et al. (2013)</ref>, we employed a stacked 1 bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the network in detail. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output.</p><p>We tried minor variants of output layer architecture and selected the one that performed the best in preliminary experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extracting Character Features Using a Convolutional Neural Network</head><p>For each word we employ a convolution and a max layer to extract a new feature vector from the percharacter feature vectors such as character embeddings (Section 2.3.2) and (optionally) character type (Section 2.5). Words are padded with a number of special PADDING characters on both sides depending on the window size of the CNN. The hyper-parameters of the CNN are the window size and the output vector size.</p><p>1 For each direction (forward and backward), the input is fed into multiple layers of LSTM units connected in sequence (i.e. LSTM units in the second layer take in the output of the first layer, and so on); the number of layers is a tuned hyperparameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows only one unit for simplicity.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Word Embeddings</head><p>Our best model uses the publicly available 50dimensional word embeddings released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> 2 , which were trained on Wikipedia and the Reuters RCV-1 corpus.</p><p>We also experimented with two other sets of published embeddings, namely Stanford's GloVe embeddings 3 trained on 6 billion words from Wikipedia and Web text <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> and Google's word2vec embeddings 4 trained on 100 billion words from Google News <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, as we hypothesized that word embeddings trained on in-domain text may perform better, we also used the publicly available GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> program and an in-house re-implementation 5 of the word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> program to train word embeddings on Wikipedia and Reuters RCV1 datasets as well. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Character Embeddings</head><p>We randomly initialized a lookup table with values drawn from a uniform distribution with range [−0.5, 0.5] to output a character embedding of 25 dimensions. The character set includes all unique characters in the CoNLL-2003 dataset 8 plus the special tokens PADDING and UNKNOWN. The PADDING token is used for the CNN, and the UNKNOWN token is used for all other characters (which appear in OntoNotes). The same set of random embeddings was used for all experiments. 9 2.4 Additional Word-level Features</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Capitalization Feature</head><p>As capitalization information is erased during lookup of the word embedding, we evaluate Collobert's method of using a separate lookup table to add a capitalization feature with the following options: allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collobert et al., 2011b)</ref>. This method is compared with the character type feature (Section 2.5) and character-level CNNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Lexicons</head><p>Most state of the art NER systems make use of lexicons as a form of external knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Passos et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>For each of the four categories (Person, Organization, Location, Misc) defined by the CoNLL 2003 NER shared task, we compiled a list of known named entities from DBpedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Auer et al., 2007)</ref>, by extracting all descendants of DBpedia types corresponding to the CoNLL categories. 14 We did not construct separate lexicons for the OntoNotes tagset because correspondences between DBpedia categories and its tags could not be found in many instances. In addition, for each entry we first removed parentheses and all text contained within, then stripped trailing punctuation, 15 and finally tokenized it with the Penn Treebank tokenization script for the purpose of partial matching. Table 1 shows the size of each category in our lexicon compared to Collobert's lexicon, which we extracted from their SENNA system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of how the lexicon features are applied. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> For each lexicon category, we match every n-gram (up to the length of the longest lexicon entry) against entries in the lexicon. A match is successful when the n-gram matches the prefix or suffix of an entry and is at least half the length of the entry. Because of the high potential for spurious matches, for all categories except Person, we discard partial matches less than 2 tokens in length. When there are multiple overlapping matches within the same category, we prefer exact matches over partial matches, and then longer matches over shorter matches, and finally earlier matches in the sentence over later matches. All matches are case insensitive.</p><p>For each token in the match, the feature is en-   coded in BIOES annotation (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single), indicating the position of the token in the matched entry. In other words, B will not appear in a suffix-only partial match, and E will not appear in a prefix-only partial match.</p><p>As we will see in Section 4.5, we found that this more sophisticated method outperforms the method presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, which treats partial and exact matches equally, allows prefix but not suffix matches, allows very short partial matches, and marks tokens with YES/ NO.</p><p>In addition, since <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> released their lexicon with their SENNA system, we also applied their lexicon to our model for comparison and investigated using both lexicons simultaneously as distinct features. We found that the two lexicons complement each other and improve performance on the CoNLL-2003 dataset.</p><p>Our best model uses the SENNA lexicon with exact matching and our DBpedia lexicon with partial matching, with BIOES annotation in both cases.</p></div>

Training and inference are done on a per-sentence level. The initial states of the LSTM are zero vectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2">Objective Function and Inference</head><p>We train our network to maximize the sentencelevel log-likelihood from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al.

This matrix of parameters are also learned. Define θ as the set of parameters for the neural network, and θ = θ ∪ {A i,j ∀i, j} as the set of all parameters to be trained. Given an example sentence, [x] T 1 , of length T , and define [f θ ] i,t as the score outputted by the neural network for the t th word and i th tag given parameters θ, then the score of a sequence of tags [i] T 1 is given as the sum of network and transition scores:  Then, letting [y] T 1 be the true tag sequence, the sentence-level log-likelihood is obtained by normalizing the above score over all possible tag-sequences [j] T 1 using a softmax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S([x] T 1 , [i] T 1 , θ ) = T t=1 A [i] t−1 ,[i]t + [f θ ] [i]t,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">log P ([y] T 1 | [x] T 1 , θ ) = S([x] T 1 , [y] T 1 , θ ) − log ∀[j] T 1 e S([x] T 1 ,[j] T 1 ,θ )</formula><p>This objective function and its gradients can be efficiently computed by dynamic programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collobert et al., 2011b)</ref>.</p><p>At inference time, given neural network outputs [f θ ] i,t we use the Viterbi algorithm to find the tag sequence [i] T 1 that maximizes the score</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S([x] T 1 , [i] T 1 , θ ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.3">Tagging Scheme</head><p>The output tags are annotated with BIOES (which stand for Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single, indicating the position of the token in the entity) as this scheme has been reported to outperform others such as BIO <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009</ref>). sion of the corpus with a different data split. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Numbers taken from the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Luo et al., 2015)</ref>.

Each mini-batch consists of multiple sentences with the same number of tokens. We found applying dropout to the output nodes 22 of each LSTM layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pham et al., 2014)</ref> was quite effective in reducing overfitting (Section 4.4). We explored other more sophisticated optimization algorithms such as momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nesterov, 1983)</ref>, AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012), and RM-SProp <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hinton et al., 2012)</ref>, and in preliminary experiments they did not improve upon plain SGD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>Evaluation was performed on the well-established CoNLL-2003 NER shared task dataset (Tjong Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref> and the much larger but less-studied OntoNotes 5.0 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hovy et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pradhan et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> gives an overview of these two different datasets.</p><p>For each experiment, we report the average and standard deviation of 10 successful trials.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset Preprocessing</head><p>For all datasets, we performed the following preprocessing:</p><p>• All digit sequences are replaced by a single "0".</p><p>• Before training, we group sentences by word length into mini-batches and shuffle them.</p><p>In addition, for the OntoNotes dataset, in order to handle the Date, Time, Money, Percent, Quantity, Ordinal, and Cardinal named entity tags, we split tokens before and after every digit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">CoNLL 2003 Dataset</head><p>The CoNLL-2003 dataset (Tjong Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref> consists of newswire from the Reuters RCV1 corpus tagged with four types of named entities: location, organization, person, and miscellaneous. As the dataset is small compared to OntoNotes, we trained the model on both the training and development sets after performing hyperparameter optimization on the development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">OntoNotes 5.0 Dataset</head><p>Pradhan et al. <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> compiled a core portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset for the CoNLL-2012 shared task and described a standard train/dev/test split, which we use for our evaluation. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Durrett and Klein (2014)</ref>, we applied our model to the portion of the dataset with gold-standard named entity annotations; the New Testaments portion was excluded for lacking gold-standard annotations. This dataset is much larger than CoNLL-2003 and consists of text from a wide variety of sources, such as broadcast conversation, broadcast news, newswire, magazine, telephone conversation, and Web text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Hyper-parameter Optimization</head><p>We performed two rounds of hyper-parameter optimization and selected the best settings based on development set performance 23 . <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the final hyper-parameters, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the dev set performance of the best models in each round.</p><p>In the first round, we performed random search and selected the best hyper-parameters over the development set of the CoNLL-2003 data. We evaluated around 500 hyper-parameter settings. Then, we took the same settings and tuned the learning rate and epochs on the OntoNotes development set. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> For the second round, we performed independent hyper-parameter searches on each dataset using Optunity's implementation of particle swarm <ref type="bibr">(Claesen et al., )</ref>, as there is some evidence that it is more efficient than random search <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clerc and Kennedy, 2002)</ref>. We evaluated 500 hyper-parameter settings this round as well. As we later found out that training fails occasionally (Section 3.5) as well as large variation from run to run, we ran the top 5 settings from each dataset for 10 trials each and selected the best one based on averaged dev set performance.</p><p>For CoNLL-2003, we found that particle swarm produced better hyper-parameters than random search. However, surprisingly for OntoNotes particle swarm was unable to produce better hyperparameters than those from the ad-hoc approach in round 1. We also tried tuning the CoNLL-2003 hyper-parameters from round 2 for OntoNotes and that was not any better 25 either.</p><p>We trained CoNLL-2003 models for a large num- <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Hyper-parameter optimization was done with the BLSTM-CNN + emb + lex feature set, as it had the best performance. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Selected based on dev set performance of a few runs. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The result is 84.41 (± 0.33) on the OntoNotes dev set.  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: F1 scores when the Collobert word vectors are replaced. We tried 50-and 300-dimensional random vectors (Random 50d, Random 300d); GloVe's released vectors trained on 6 billion words (GloVe 6B 50d, GloVe 6B 300d); Google's released 300-dimensional vectors trained on 100 billion words from Google News (Google 100B 300d); and 50-dimensional GloVe and word2vec skip-gram vectors that we trained on Wikipedia and Reuters RCV-1 (Our GloVe 50d, Our Skip-gram 50d). ber of epochs because we observed that the models did not exhibit overtraining and instead continued to slowly improve on the development set long after reaching near 100% accuracy on the training set. In contrast, despite OntoNotes being much larger than CoNLL-2003, training for more than about 18 epochs causes performance on the development set to decline steadily due to overfitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Excluding Failed Trials</head><p>On the CoNLL-2003 dataset, while BLSTM models completed training without difficulty, the BLSTM-CNN models fail to converge around 5∼10% of the time depending on feature set. Similarly, on OntoNotes, 1.5% of trials fail. We found that using a lower learning rate reduces failure rate. We also tried clipping gradients and using AdaDelta and both of them were effective at eliminating such failures by themselves. AdaDelta, however, made training more expensive with no gain in model performance.</p><p>In any case, for all experiments we excluded trials where the final F1 score on a subset of training data falls below a certain threshold, and continued to run trials until we obtained 10 successful ones.</p><p>For CoNLL-2003, we excluded trials where the final F1 score on the development set was less than 95; there was no ambiguity in selecting the threshold as every trial scored either above 98 or below 90. For OntoNotes, the threshold was a F1 score of 80 on the last 5,000 sentences of the training set; every trial scored either above 80 or below 75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Training and Tagging Speed</head><p>On an Intel Xeon E5-2697 processor, training takes about 6 hours while tagging the test set takes about 12 seconds for CoNLL-2003. The times are 10 hours and 60 seconds respectively for OntoNotes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> shows the results for all datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our best models have surpassed the previous highest reported F1 scores for both <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2003</ref> and OntoNotes. In particular, with no external knowledge other than word embeddings, our model is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and establishes a new state of the art for OntoNotes, suggesting that given enough data, the neural network automatically learns the relevant features for NER without feature engineering.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Word Embeddings</head><p>One possible reason that Collobert embeddings perform better than other publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003 is that they are trained on the Reuters RCV-1 corpus, the source of the CoNLL-2003 dataset, whereas the other embeddings are not 28 . On the other hand, we suspect that Google's embeddings perform poorly because of vocabulary mismatch -in particular, Google's embeddings were trained in a case-sensitive manner, and embeddings for many common punctuations and 27 Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001 28 To make a direct comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, we do not exclude the CoNLL-2003 NER task test data from the word vector training data. While it is possible that this difference could be responsible for the disparate performance of word vectors, the CoNLL-2003 training data comprises only 20k out of 800 million words, or 0.00002% of the total data; in an unsupervised training scheme, the effects are likely negligible. symbols were not provided. To test these hypotheses, we performed experiments with new word embeddings trained using GloVe and word2vec, with vocabulary list and corpus similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et. al. (2011b)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, our GloVe embeddings improved significantly 29 over publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003, and our word2vec skip-gram embeddings improved significantly 30 over Google's embeddings on OntoNotes.</p><p>Due to time constraints we did not perform new hyper-parameter searches with any of the word embeddings. As word embedding quality depends on hyper-parameter choice during their training <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, and also, in our NER neural network, hyper-parameter choice is likely sensitive to the type of word embeddings used, optimizing them all will likely produce better results and provide a fairer comparison of word embedding quality.  value may not be the best-performing in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 6</ref> shows that on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, using features from both the SENNA lexicon and our proposed DBpedia lexicon provides a significant 32 improvement and allows our model to clearly surpass the previous state of the art. Unfortunately the difference is minuscule for OntoNotes, most likely because our lexicon does not match DBpedia categories well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows that on CoNLL-2003, lexicon coverage is reasonable and matches the tags set for everything except the catchall MISC category. For example, LOC entries in lexicon match mostly LOC named entities and vice versa. However, on OntoNotes, the matches are noisy and correspondence between lexicon match and tag category is quite ambiguous. For example, all lexicon categories have spurious matches in unrelated named entities like CARDINAL, and LOC, GPE, and LANGUAGE entities all get a lot of matches from the LOC category in the lexicon. In addition, named entities in categories like NORP, ORG, LAW, PRODUCT receive little coverage. The lower coverage, noise, and ambiguity all contribute to the disappointing performance. This suggests that the DBpedia lexicon construction method needs to be improved. A reasonable place to start would be the DBpedia category to OntoNotes NE tag mappings.</p></div>

Table 9 shows the results. In this weakened model, both lexicons contribute significant 33 improvements over the baseline.</p><p>Compared to the SENNA lexicon, our DBpedia lexicon is noisier but has broader coverage, which explains why when applying it using the same method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, it performs worse on CoNLL-2003 but better on OntoNotesa dataset containing many more obscure named entities. However, we suspect that the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> is not noise resistant and therefore unsuitable for our lexicon because it fails to distinguish exact and partial matches 34 and does not set a minimum length for partial matching. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> Instead, when we apply our superior partial matching algorithm and BIOES encoding with our DBpedia lexicon, we gain a significant 36 improvement, allowing our lexicon to perform similarly to the SENNA lexicon. Unfortunately, as we could not reliably remove partial entries from the SENNA lexicon, we were unable to investigate whether or not our lexicon matching method would help in that lexicon.</p><p>In addition, using both lexicons together as distinct features provides a further improvement 37 on CoNLL-2003, which we suspect is because the lexi- <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.05 for SENNA-Exact-BIOES, p &lt; 0.005 for all others. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> We achieve this by using BIOES encoding and prioritizing exact matches over partial matches. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> Matching only the first word of a long entry is not very useful; this is not a problem in the SENNA lexicon because 99% of its entries contain only 3 tokens or less. <ref type="bibr">36</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>: Comparison of lexicon and matching/encoding methods over the BLSTM-CNN model employing random embeddings and no other features.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have shown that our neural network model, which incorporates a bidirectional LSTM and a character-level CNN and which benefits from robust training through dropout, achieves state-of-the-art results in named entity recognition with little feature engineering. Our model improves over previous best reported results on two major datasets for NER, suggesting that the model is capable of learning complex relationships from large amounts of data.</p><p>Preliminary evaluation of our partial matching lexicon algorithm suggests that performance could be further improved through more flexible application of existing lexicons. Evaluation of existing word embeddings suggests that the domain of training data is as important as the training algorithm.</p><p>More effective construction and application of lexicons and word embeddings are areas that require more research. In the future, we would also like to extend our model to perform similar tasks such as extended tagset NER and entity linking.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The (unrolled) BLSTM for tagging named entities.
