<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Despite the renewed interest that conformal field theories (CFTs) with (0,2) supersymmetry have reclaimed in the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, little is still known about the moduli space of deformations of such theories (the conformal manifold) in general. In the context of heterotic string theory, this is the target space in which the massless scalars of the spacetime theory take values. Moreover, much of the work concerning (0,2) theories has focused on deformations of theories with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> supersymmetry. While there are certainly notable challenges even in this tamer setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, in many instances features of (2,2) theories are more or less straightforwardly inherited by this larger space of deformations. Thus, it is of most interest to pursue the study of (0,2) models which do not admit a <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> locus.</p><p>In the geometric setting of nonlinear sigma models (NLSMs), a (0,2) model is determined by a (conformally invariant) Calabi-Yau target space M along with a polystable holomorphic bundle E over it, subject to some conditions (for some recent work on these see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>). Examples with a (2,2) locus are obtained when E is a deformation of T M . NLSMs are UV free theories and for suitable choices of the geometric data are expected to flow to nontrivial SCFTs in the IR. A first approximation to the moduli space of deformations of the SCFT is given by deformations of the complex structure of M , deformations of its Kähler structure, and deformations of E (there are some caveats to this associated to Atiyah classes). The NLSM in principle contains in the UV theory models that flow to the entire conformal manifold. In general, however, worldsheet instantons are expected to lift some of these vacua <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, so that the moduli space is a quantum corrected version of the classical space. In general we lack the tools to compute these corrections. Since the large-radius limit in which these corrections vanish is not a point in the moduli space, NLSM calculations are strictly valid only where such instanton corrections are absent.</p><p>Landau-Ginzburg orbifold (LGO) theories are another class of UV free models expected to flow to nontrivial SCFTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. For these theories we have computational techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> that produce exact results. These are valid for a locus in the moduli space (the LG locus); deformations along this (realized as deformations of the LG potential) are described exactly. Deformations away from this locus (generically of high codimension) are not well described, restricting the kind of computations possible. Even in this rather manageable class of models, the (0,2) story is not as simple as the (2,2) situation. In general, accidental Abelian global symmetries of the IR theory mix with the R-symmetry, invalidating calculations based on the UV symmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Some of these "accidents" in LG models can be explicitly exhibited in terms of the UV theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, although in general accidental IR symmetries can be difficult to see in the UV.</p><p>Gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> make explicit the possibility that the LGO locus is a subspace of the NLSM moduli space, although disjoint from the large radius limit. In the GLSM set-up, the large radius limit and the LGO arise as "phase limits", limiting values of the UV parameters in which a simplified description of the IR physics is applicable. In the GLSM framework, worldsheet instanton effects take the form of gauge instanton effects, and in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> one can show that they do not lift GLSM vacua. The space of GLSMs flows to a subspace of the moduli space.</p><p>LGO phases appear to be relatively rare. More common, although far from generic, are hybrid phases in which the space of classical vacua is compact and there are, in addition to the NLSM on this, massless fields interacting via a superpotential.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel class of (0,2) models based on hybrid geometries, extending the construction of (2,2) hybrid models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and describe a technique to compute the complete massless spectrum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Hybrid theories are a natural generalization of both LG models and NLSMs, and while it is fair to say that a generic (0,2) SCFT will not be described by a hybrid model, we are nonetheless enlarging the set of points where exact computations can be carried out. Indeed, under favorable circumstances, a hybrid model, while carrying non-trivial geometric structure, is simple enough that explicit computations can be performed. We offer evidence that the problem of accidental symmetries is ameliorated by hybrids in the sense that "accidental" LG models can produce well-behaved theories and suggest that many of the models we construct do not, in fact, arise as GLSM phase limits.</p><p>Although our main interest lies in models suitable for heterotic compactifications, our construction can be straightforwardly generalized to yield more general (0,2) SCFTs. In the first part of this work we will take the more general approach, and we will point out which conditions should be further imposed for string applications. In the second part of this note, in which we tackle the computation of the massless spectrum and we apply our techniques to solve explicit examples, we will restrict our attention to hybrid SCFTs suitable for heterotic compactifications.</p><p>The rest of this note is organized as follows. We begin in section 2 by describing the construction of our class of models. In section 3 we proceed by deriving the constraints from anomaly cancellation and exploring the basic low-energy properties. We then turn in section 4 to a generalization of the methods for computing the massless spectrum for heterotic compactifications based on our models, and apply these techniques to nontrivial examples in section 5. Here, we will provide evidence for using hybrids as a "cure" for resolving LG accidents. In section 6 we present a criterion for a hybrid to arise as a phase in a GLSM exhibiting a Calabi-Yau large radius limit and show that even for a toric base this is nontrivial.</p><p>Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the physics department at Duke University for hospitality while some of this work was completed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A peek at hybrids</head><p>The models we construct in this work provide a description of suitable limiting loci in the moduli space of (0,2) SCFTs. Hybrid limits have been discussed in the context of (0,2) GLSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or of (0,2) NLSMs with superpotential <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Our approach is closer in spirit to the latter, so we begin with a quick review of this. In general, to write a (0,2) NLSM with superpotential 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> one requires a D-dimensional Kähler target space Y 0 equipped with a Kähler metric g αβ determined by the Kähler potential K(y, y), a rank-R holomorphic vector bundle E 0 → Y 0 equipped with a Hermitian inner product h AB , as well as a holomorphic section J ∈ Ω 0 (E * 0 ). The model is then constructed using D bosonic chiral multiplets Y α and R fermionic chiral multiplets X A , with expansions</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y α = y α + √ 2θη α + θθ∂ z y α , Y α = y α − √ 2θη α − θθ∂ z y α , X A = χ A + √ 2θH A + θθ∂ z χ A , X A = χ A + √ 2θH A − θθ∂ z χ A . (2.5)</formula><p>Here, y α , α = 1, . . . , D, are coordinates on Y 0 , η α are right-moving fermions on the worldsheet that transform as sections of the tangent bundle T Y 0 , χ A , A = 1, . . . , R, are left-moving fermions on the worldsheet which transform as sections of the bundle E 0 and H A are nonpropagating auxiliary fields.</p><p>In terms of these we can write the classical Lagrange density as a sum of a kinetic term L kin and a superpotential term L W where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L kin = d 2 θ 1 2 (K α ∂ z Y α − K α ∂ z Y α ) + H AB X A X B , L W = m dθX A J A + h.c. ,<label>(2.6)</label></formula><p>with K α ≡ ∂ α K, and m is a coupling with dimensions of mass. With J = 0, or at energies well above m, this is just a NLSM with target space Y 0 and left-moving fermions coupled to E 0 . If c 1 (T Y 0 ) = c 1 (E 0 ) = 0 and ch 2 (T Y 0 ) = ch 2 (E 0 ), this will determine a superconformally invariant theory to all orders in perturbation theory. We typically consider this SCFT as describing the IR dynamics of the theory. The details of the various metrics introduced are associated to irrelevant deformations of this; the space of SCFTs will be locally parameterized by the complex structure of Y 0 , the Kähler class of g, and the deformations of E 0 as a holomorphic bundle. Non-perturbative effects (worldsheet instantons) can modify this moduli space, and will be discussed below. The NLSM is weakly coupled when the Kähler class is deep within the Kähler cone of Y 0 . An important role in understanding the low-energy dynamics is played by the chiral U(1) L × U(1) R symmetry under which χ, resp. ψ are charged. The topological conditions mentioned ensure that these are nonanomalous. Strictly speaking these results are well known when Y 0 is compact; this will not be the case in our examples but we expect no subtleties to arise due to this.</p><p>Given values of the parameters, however, we can consider the SCFT they determine as a UV fixed point and study the low-energy dynamics obtained when we add a superpotential, which is a relevant coupling. In general, this breaks the U(1) L × U(1) R symmetry. If Y 0 admits a holomorphic Killing vector V and End(E 0 ) a global holomorphic section Q such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Qχ · J = χ · L V J ,<label>(2.7)</label></formula><p>we have an unbroken U(1) L × U(1) R under which</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δχ = −iǫ L Qχ − iǫ R (Q + 1)χ , δy = iǫ L V (y) + iǫ R V (y) . (2.8)</formula><p>For sufficiently generic J, there will be a unique such V . Since the action differs by a nonchiral correction from the naïve symmetry, this is nonanomalous under the same topological conditions mentioned above. The superpotential is a relevant deformation and at low energies the UV theory will flow, under suitable conditions, to a family of low-energy SCFTs parameterized in addition by the section J. The superpotential interaction induces a potential for y given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">U (y) = m 2 |J(y)| 2 ,<label>(2.9)</label></formula><p>so low-energy dynamics will be determined by the structure of Y 0 and E 0 in the vicinity of B = J −1 (0). Our interest will be in models in which a generic J vanishes on a compact B. This is the potential condition. In this limit, we expand the Kähler potential K to quadratic order about B as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">K = K(x, x) + φ † hφ + · · · , (2.10)</formula><p>where K is a Kähler potential for a metric on B, with local coordinates x, and h is a hermitian metric on the normal bundle N B, with local coordinates φ. This corresponds to approximating Y 0 as the total space of Y = N B → B, and the bundle E 0 as a bundle E → Y . In the large-radius limit one might think of the theory as described fiberwise over B by a LG model, adiabatically varying over the base. In order for this description to be useful, it is important that the isometry V be vertical fixing the base pointwise. Models satisfying this criterion are called good hybrids. The models obtained by this method will inherit the property that c 1 (E) = c 1 (T Y ) = 0. However, it is possible that the resulting structure contains spectator fields as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Consider a model in which we have a chiral field S taking values in a line bundle over Y and a Fermi field Ξ taking values in the dual line bundle. These admit a superpotential coupling</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">W S = m S SΞ .</formula><p>(2.11)</p><p>These fields introduce no massless modes, and at energies well below m S can be integrated out. The quotient bundle E ′ obtained by dropping ξ and restricting to Y ′ = {s = 0} will then be described as above, but we will in general find after reduction to low energy the weaker condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c 1 (E ′ ) + c 1 (T Y ′ ) = 0.</formula><p>In this work we will take a bottom-up approach. We will construct a hybrid model determined by the quadruple (Y , E, V, J), where Y is the total space of a vector bundle over a compact Kähler base B, and E is a holomorphic vector bundle over Y</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E −→ Y , Y = tot X π −→ B . (2.12) We denote d = dim C B , n = dim C X , R = rank E . (2.13)</formula><p>V determines a vertical U(1)-action on Y , and a lift of this action to E. The last piece of data is given by the (0,2) superpotential J ∈ Γ(E * ). We assume that this satisfies the potential condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, i.e., J −1 (0) = B.</p><p>In the remainder of this section we will construct a (0,2) theory from these ingredients, and argue that under suitable conditions the IR dynamics will be determined by a (0,2) superconformal theory which is our real interest. The V action will endow our theory with a global U(1) L symmetry which will be essential in controlling IR physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Before delving into the details of the construction two remarks are in order. In contrast to the situation in (2,2) models, in (0,2) theories the relation between UV and IR physics exhibits various subtleties. In particular, a unique U(1) L × U(1) R symmetry in the UV (which we will assume) does not exclude mixing with accidental symmetries in the IR, rendering predictions based on the UV symmetry incorrect. As demonstrated in the simple setting of LG models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, even the central charge of the IR symmetry is in general not manifest in the UV. Presumably analogous phenomena occur in more elaborate models such as those considered here, and we do not know how to resolve the question definitively. We will provide some evidence here that the hybrid construction in fact resolves some of the problems found there, in the sense that some LG models suffering from "accidents" can be used to construct hybrid models that do not exhibit the expected pathologies. Furthermore, computations of physically interesting quantities 3 like the ones presented here yield a good deal of information about the model, and can provide evidence in favor of, or against, a putative model.</p><p>A second remark concerns the extent to which our construction produces a well-defined theory. To write a (0,2) NLSM on Y we require a Kähler metric on Y such that V acts as a vertical isometry. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, for sufficiently "negative" bundles (see section 2.2) we can use h to construct such a metric. In general, when this is not the case, we can imagine a space Y 0 with an immersion B → Y 0 such that T Y 0 | B = T B ⊕ X and equipped with a Kähler metric reducing near B to the form (2.10). The formulation we provide will give an effective description of the dynamics for energies E ≪ m, and will be valid deep enough in the Kähler cone that the nonlinear sigma model is weakly coupled at the scale E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The target space</head><p>The construction begins with a (0,2) NLSM on the target space Y = tot X π −→ B . Coordinates on Y will be denoted y α and following the bundle structure we split these into coordinates on the base and the fiber as y α = (y µ , φ), with µ = 1, . . . , d and φ ∈ Γ(X).</p><p>We equip Y with a Kähler metric induced by a Kähler potential K. The low-energy physics of a well-behaved hybrid will be described by small fluctuations of the fiber fields around the base, so we expand K to quadratic order in φ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K = K(y µ , y µ ) + φ † hφ + · · · ,<label>(2.14)</label></formula><p>where K is a Kähler potential for a metric on B and h is a hermitian metric on X.</p><p>As usual the detailed form of the metric will be irrelevant to the IR physics, but the Kähler class will appear as a parameter in the low-energy physics in the models we discuss. Because Y retracts to B this is determined by a class in h 2 (B). Our NLSM will be weakly coupled, and the IR physics simply connected to the UV data, when this takes values deep into the Kähler cone of B.</p><p>The V action on Y is generated by a holomorphic Killing vector field of the metric. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, this is determined by a covariantly constant section A ∈ Γ(X ⊗ X * ) such that hA † = −Ah. The bundle X then has an orthogonal decomposition X = ⊕ i X i into eigenspaces of A with eigenvalue −iq i . Reasonable models will emerge for 0 &lt; q i &lt; 1. We will assume here that X i can be taken to be line bundles. This is not an essential restriction but it will simplify notation and provide sufficiently varied examples. We can then represent the field φ = i φ i where φ i ∈ Γ(X i ); we will refer to q i as the charge of φ i . Our considerations apply with no real modification to the case in which X = X/Γ is an orbi-bundle given by a discrete group quotient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The left-moving bundle</head><p>As mentioned above, the choice of a holomorphic vector bundle E over Y is part of the defining data of our construction. Our construction will work if E respects the bundle structure of Y and admits a suitable lift of the V action. We will in the following describe a particular class of such bundles, for which we have a relatively straightforward method to explicitly compute the complete massless spectrum following <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. The calculations are in fact simplest for bundles over Y that pull back from bundles over B, but this excludes, for example, (2, 2) models; the class of models we consider is large enough to contain these while still amenable to our computational method.</p><p>We start our construction with an auxiliary collection of irreducible holomorphic bundles F Γ → B, Γ = 1, . . . R + m, for some m ≥ 0. As in the case of the bundle X above, we choose to restrict ourselves to the case where F Γ are line bundles to simplify notation. Again, this restriction is not essential. In terms of these, we define E by the SES</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">0 / / O ⊕m Y E / / ⊕ Γ π * (F Γ ) F / / E / / 0 , (2.15)</formula><p>where π is the projection map defined in <ref type="bibr">(2.12)</ref>.</p><p>The existence of a lift of the V action to E is imposed on this structure by assigning charge Q Γ to the summand F Γ and charge −1 to the first term, and requiring that the maps are all equivariant, ensuring that the cokernel in fact carries a V action. We order Γ so that Q 1 ≤ Q 2 ≤ · · · . Reasonable IR theories will emerge for −1 ≤ Q Γ &lt; 0. The map E is then represented by a collection of sections E Γ ∈ Γ(π * F Γ ) of charge</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">V (E Γ ) = (Q Γ + 1)E Γ .</formula><p>(2.16)</p><p>We assume that for sufficiently generic maps this defines a smooth bundle (or an orbi-bundle). In particular, since q i &gt; 0, Q Γ = −1 implies that E Γ is constant along fibers of X, while for Q Γ &gt; −1, E Γ is quasi-homogeneous of positive degree on the fibers and vanishes on the base.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Let −1 = Q P &lt; Q P +1 determining 0 ≤ P ≤ R + m.</formula><p>If we consider the restriction of (2.15) to the base</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">0 / / O ⊕m B E| B / / ⊕ Γ F Γ F | B / / E| B / / 0 , (2.17)</formula><p>the vanishing of the last R + m − P maps shows that the bundle splits as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E| B = ⊕ R+m Γ=P +1 FΓ ⊕ E B , where E B → B is defined by 0 / / O ⊕m B E B / / ⊕ P Γ=1 F Γ F B / / E B / / 0 . (2.18)</formula><p>The map E B (F B ) is obtained from the restriction map E| B (F | B ) simply by ignoring the last R + m − P rows (columns). In other words, (2.18) is the projection to B of the restriction of (2.15) to degree −1 under the V -action. Of course, in (2,2) theories E B = T B . From (2.15) and (2.18) it then follows that the bundle E can be equivalently defined by the following SES</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">0 / / ⊕ R+m Γ=P +1 π * FΓ / / E / / π * E B / / 0 . (2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>19)</head><p>A proof of the above statement can be found in appendix A. In other words, given a collection of F Γ and maps E B , the bundles E we can obtain are classified by extensions of π * E B by ⊕ R+m P +1 π * FΓ. For our purposes, we can take <ref type="bibr">(2.19)</ref> to be our definition of the bundle for our models, and keep the discussion above as motivation for this particular form. It is worth noting that a nonsingular bundle E might still give rise to a singular model by failing to satisfy the potential condition. In some cases we can obtain both smooth and singular models depending on the extension we choose.</p><p>We can make this dependence on the fiber coordinates explicit. We can write the map EΓ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">EΓ = r∈∆Γ M r S r Γ , M r = i (φ i ) r i , (2.20) where ∆Γ = r ∈ Z ⊕n ≥0 i q i r i = QΓ + 1 (2.21)</formula><p>indicates the monomials of suitable charge for inclusion in EΓ and S r Γ is a section of L r Γ = FΓ ⊗ i (X * i ) ⊗r i .

Given the bundle structure for Y in (2.12), it is often convenient to split the coordinates as y α = (y µ , φ i ), µ = 1, . . . , d, i = 1, . . . , n, which represents the splitting into base versus fiber coordinates.

This will remain a symmetry of the quantum theory if the path-integral measure is invariant in the background of an instanton.

In LG models, the low-energy theory localizes to a point, and there are no worldsheet instantons.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterotic hybrids</head><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to complete our hybrid model to a critical heterotic background. We supplement our internal (0,2) hybrid theory (c = 2D + r, c = 3D) by adding a set of free left-moving fermions λ realizing a level 1 so(16 − 2r) current algebra (c = 8 − r, c = 0), a left-moving level 1 e 8 current algebra for the hidden sector (c = 8, c = 0) and the degrees of freedom of the extended spacetime R 1,9−2D (c = 10 − 2D, c = 15 − 3D). We perform separate GSO projections on both left-and right-moving fermion numbers. The left-moving GSO projection is onto e iπJ 0 (−1) F λ = 1, where J 0 denotes the U(1) L conserved charge, and F λ is the fermion number for the so(16 − 2r) left-moving fermions. This is responsible for modular invariance and for enhancing the linearly realized so(16 − 2r) ⊕ u(1) L to the full spacetime gauge group G [31] determined by  The right-moving GSO projection implies spacetime supersymmetry, and in particular it determines an isomorphism between the right-moving Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors.

The resolution is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and amounts to perform an orbifold by quotienting the hybrid theory by the symmetry generated by e 2πiJ 0 , where J 0 is the charge associated to J L . In particular, let q i = a i /L i for a i , L i ∈ Z &gt;0 , then we orbifold the theory by Z L where L = lcm(L 1 , . . . , L n ). The fact that the superpotential satisfies the condition J −1 (0) = B implies that including the charges Q I in the discussion is not necessary. Moreover, we can combine the orbifold with the left-moving Z 2 GSO projection in a single Z 2L orbifold. The orbifold theory consists of a collection of twisted sectors labelled by an integer k = 0, . . . , 2L − 1. Sectors with even k are associated to (R,R) sectors and their study is sufficient to determine the G-charged content of the theory. Odd k sectors yield additional G-neutral states, which correspond to G-preserving first-order deformations of the theory. Moreover, the spectrum must be invariant under CPT, which exchanges the sectors k and −k mod 2L. Thus, in the following it will suffice to analyze twisted sectors labeled by k = 0, . . . , L.</p><p>The Hilbert space in the hybrid limit</p><p>We anticipated above that right-moving zero-energy states are selected by Q-cohomology. By construction, Q commutes with the left-moving U(1) L charge and Hamiltonian.

The right-moving U(1) R R-charge J 0 can be obtained in the UV theory as J 0 = J 0 +J R , where J R assigns charge −1 to η α and +1 to χ A . In particular, the charges (4.2) induce a grading on the Hilbert space H = ⊕ q,h H q,h , and in computing Q-cohomology we can restrict to each of the subspaces H q,h . We denote this grading as the physical grading. In particular, as we are interested in the massless spectrum, we restrict our attention to H q,h≤0 . Hilbert subspaces with strictly negative left-moving energy are paired with the appropriate so(16 − 2r) left-moving oscillators in such a way that the total left-moving energy vanishes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> A model based on a non-trivial hybrid geometry exhibits the same features as the more familiar setting of a compact NLSM: worldsheet instantons wrapping non-trivial cycles in B are expected to generate non-perturbative corrections to RG-invariant quantities, such as massless spectra, Yukawa couplings, etc. We then perform these computations in the limit where the Kähler class of B lies deep in its Kähler cone. This defines the hybrid limit, which identifies a (limiting) point in the Kähler moduli space around which a perturbative expansion in worldsheet instantons is well-defined, as the corrections due to topologically nontrivial maps are negligible. We stress that this point lies at infinite distance in the Kähler moduli space, and the existence of such limit is tied to our assumption that the R-symmetry does not act on the base coordinates.

First, as it can be observed from (4.7), sectors for k ∈ 2Z can have E |k &lt; 0 and it does not suffice to reduce to zero modes. Second, the splitting of the coordinates into light modes -which organize themselves in a non-trivial geometry -and heavy modes -which instead transform simply as pullbacks -must be generalized for (0,2) models. A great simplification comes from the fact that we always have E |k &gt; −1. Thus the massless states are contained in the subspace of the Hilbert space obtained by exciting only the lowest energy modes of the left-moving fields. In particular, we truncate the expansions (4.3) to s ∈ (−1, 1), that is, for the bosonic fields</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">y µ ≡ y µ 0 , φ i ≡ φ i −ν i , ρ † i ≡ φ i 1−ν i , y µ † ≡ ρ µ,0 , φ i † ≡ ρ i,ν i , ρ i ≡ ρ i,ν i −1 , (4.24)</formula><p>while for the left-moving fermions we distinguish between k ∈ 2Z (where ν M = 0)</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">χ † M ≡ χ M 0 , χ † I ≡ χ I − ν I , χ I ≡ χ I −1− ν I , χ M ≡ χ M,0 , χ I ≡ χ I, ν I , χ I † ≡ χ I,1+ ν I ,<label>(4.25)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">k ∈ 2Z + 1 (where ν M = −1/2) χ † A ≡ χ A − ν A , χ A ≡ χ A −1− ν A , χ A ≡ χ A, ν A , χ A † ≡ χ A,1+ ν A . (4.26)</formula><p>Next, we expand G A B in (4.18) in terms of these modes, and we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">χ I b = C I ab χ M a + g I ab χ I a = r∈∆ I+m M r f I ab,r χ M a + g I ab χ I a . (4.27)</formula><p>The term defined by each monomial M r = i (φ i ) r i contributes in the twisted sector, i.e., it is not projected out by the truncation to lowest-energy modes, if and only if the energy contributions of the various terms match, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">1 + ν I = 1 + ν M + i r i ν i . (4.28)</formula><p>In other words, even if all the modes φ i in M r survive the projection, the monomial itself might not contribute to the transition functions for the bundle E, and it does so if and only if (4.28) is satisfied. For k ∈ 2Z, in particular, ν M = 0, thus we have ν I = i r i ν i . However, ν I ≤ 0 while i r i ν i is a sum of non-negative quantities, thus (4.28) is satisfied only if ν I = r i ν i = 0. This implies that we can distinguish the fields as (base,zero modes,heavy) coordinates y α according to α = (µ, i ′ , ι) such that ν i ′ = 0 and ν ι &gt; 0. Thus, base and fiber zero modes are coordinates on a sub-bundle Y k ⊆ Y defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_83">Y k : tot ⊕ i ′ X i ′ π k −→ B ,<label>(4.29)</label></formula><p>while the heavy coordinates transform as pullbacks π * k (X ι ). Note that the modes ρ i ′ cannot contribute to the massless spectrum in these sectors as they carry weight h = 1, while ρ ι transform as sections of the pullback bundle π * k (X * ι ) over Y k , thus not needing any Fermi bilinear correction. This shows already that obstructions of the form (4.19) are absent in sectors k ∈ 2Z. For the Fermi modes, we have a similar splitting into A = (M, I ′ , Λ), where ν I ′ = 0 and ν Λ &lt; 0. Indeed, (4.28) can only be satisfied for A = I ′ and for M r = i ′ (φ i ′ ) r i ′ , that is, all the monomials M r are restricted to zero modes. Thus, the zero modes χ M,I ′ organize themselves as a sub-bundle E k → Y k of E defined by the SES</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">0 / / ⊕ I ′ π * k F I ′ +m / / E k / / π * k E B / / 0 ,<label>(4.30)</label></formula><p>with transition functions defined by the projection onto zero modes of (2.22).

In fact, any monomial M r with a non-trivial dependence on any of the heavy coordinates φ ι cannot satisfy <ref type="bibr">(4.32)</ref>. Note that in k &gt; 1 sectors of sensible models E |k &gt; −1 and we can again suppress the base oscillator ρ µ dependence. Moreover, ρ ι will transform again as sections of the pullback bundles π * k (X * ι ). For the Fermi modes, we have a similar splitting into A = (M, I ′ , Λ) such that (4.32) is satisfied for some r ∈ ∆ I ′ +m and is never satisfied for r ∈ ∆ Λ+m . The light fields χ M,I ′ then organize themselves as a sub-bundle E k → Y k of E defined by the SES (4.30), whose transition functions are obtained from (2.22) by projecting onto M r such that (4.32) holds. As before, the heavy fields instead transform as pullbacks π * k (F Λ+m ) and the modes χ A transform in the dual of the corresponding bundles. Finally, we need to pair the light modes ρ i ′ to the Fermi bi-linear using a connection on E k , and the well-defined combination will transform as a section of T Y k . We summarize again all the relevant modes and their transformation properties in a generic twisted sector k ∈ 2Z ≥0 + 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">modes y α,i ′ y ι ρ i ′ − A (N,J ′ ) i ′ (M,I ′ ) χ N,J ′ χ M,I ′ ρ ι χ M,I ′ χ Λ χ M,I ′ χ Λ bundle Y k π * k X ι T Y k π * k (X * ι ) E k π * k F Λ+m E * k π * k F * Λ+m .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">(0,2) sheaf cohomology</head><p>We now turn to the description of the techniques to compute the graded cohomology groups relevant for the massless spectrum analysis. In particular, we will focus on the cohomology groups H • (Y , E). The analysis can be straightforwardly generalized to the dual bundle E * and more general tensor (and wedge) products, thus covering all the relevant elements in H q,h . Our starting point is the fine grading r ∈ Z ⊕n , which we recall assigns to each fiber monomial i (φ i ) r i the vector r = (r 1 , . . . , r n ). In the case E = T Y it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that the SES defining T Y can be graded with respect to r as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_89">0 / / ⊕ i (π * X i ) r+x i / / (T Y ) r / / (π * T B ) r / / 0 ,<label>(4.35)</label></formula><p>where (x i ) j = δ ij . From this form, by passing to the induced LES, it is possible to reduce the computation to cohomology groups over the base. Generically, there is an obstruction in doing so when E = T Y . The sections EΓ in (2.20) do not respect in general the fine grading r, as different monomials consistent with (2.16) are associated to different fine grades. We then start by defining</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">∆ ′Γ = r ∈ ∆Γ S r Γ = 0 . (4.36)</formula><p>This selects the monomials that do appear (with non-zero coefficient) in the maps <ref type="bibr">(2.20)</ref>. It is also convenient to define</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">δΓ = r 1 − r 2 , ∀r 1,2 ∈ ∆ ′Γ ,<label>(4.37)</label></formula><p>and let ΠΓ be the (codimension at least one) sublattice of Z ⊕n generated by the elements of δΓ. More generally, let Π be the sublattice of Z ⊕n generated by the elements of δΓ, Γ = P + 1, . . . , R + m. While the fine grading by r is not preserved by the transition functions, it is clear by construction that the coarser grading by</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">R ∈ Z ⊕n Π ,<label>(4.38)</label></formula><p>is preserved; we denote this the coarse grading. Now, let H q ⊂ R n be the "charge q" hyperplane defined by the relation i q i x i = q. Then we have that Π ⊆ H 0 ∩ Z ⊕n . We see therefore the relation between the various gradings introduced so far:</p><p>• If Π = ∅, the bundle E splits as a sum of line bundles. More generally, if ∆Γ is empty, δΓ is empty as well and we can write E = E ′ ⊕ π * FΓ for some E ′ .</p><p>• If Π = {0}, then R reduces simply to the fine grading r. This occurs when ∆Γ = { rΓ} is one-dimensional for allΓ.</p><p>• If Π = H 0 ∩ Z ⊕n , then R = H q(R) ∩ Z ⊕n is the physical grading, where q(R) = q(r) for R = [r]. In this case, the energy grading simply follows from the charge grading since q i = 2h i for φ i .</p><p>• If Π ⊂ H 0 ∩ Z ⊕n , and if Π is non-trivial (in the sense that it is not empty and it does not consist only of the zero element), then R ⊂ H q(R) ∩ Z ⊕n , and it is apparent that this is a refinement of the physical grading. This occurs whenever ∆Γ, for someΓ, contains at least two elements. This is precisely the case we are interested in solving.</p><p>Note that in general each conjugacy class in (4.38) is infinite as a subset of Z ⊕n . Our interest is in sections with local polynomial dependence on the fiber coordinates, so we define the truncated coarse grading class as the intersection of the class R with the positive orthant, R + ≡ R ∩ Z ⊕n + . This will contain a finite number of points (monomials).</p><p>Finally, we show how to compute such graded cohomology groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Obstructions and CPT</head><p>Consistent physical theories must exhibit CPT as a symmetry.

As shown in <ref type="bibr">(4.19)</ref>, this is not always the case, signaling the possibility of non-trivial obstructions. In (2,2) models, it has been argued that such obstructions would lead to a violation of CPT, therefore these had to be required to vanish in a physically relevant model. This is not necessarily the case outside the realm of (2,2) hybrids, and we now turn to the description of a class of obstructions that potentially arise in our (0,2) models. The case where the hybrid formalism is employed to describe the massless spectrum of a (0,2) NLSM with a CY 3 manifold target space equipped with a left-moving SU(n) stable bundle V has been already worked out in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Thus, we consider here hybrid models where the orbifold action Z 2L is non-trivial. This implies, in particular, that the CPT conjugate twisted sectors k = 1 and k = −1 do not coincide, and the class of obstructions we are going to discuss will involve gauge singlets arising in these two sectors. For ease of exposition, only in this section we make a few simplifying assumptions: we assume c = 9 and that the charges of the fields satisfy the bounds q i &lt; 1/2 and Q A &lt; −1/2. The motivation behind the first assumption is that it allows us to be more explicit in our presentation and it corresponds to the phenomenologically more interesting class of models. Second, fields which do not satisfy the bounds on the charges above give rise to extra massless states, which however do not take part in the class of obstructions we are going to describe. Moreover, a model with d = 3 is necessarily equipped with a c = 0 fiber LG theory, in which all the fiber fields are massive in the sense that the superpotential is linear in the fiber fields and the above bounds on the charges cannot be satisfied. This means that, in our current analysis, we can restrict our attention to the case d ≤ 2.</p><p>From the general discussion above, all the fields in the k = 1 sector are light, and welldefined states transform as sections of the appropriate bundles over Y .

Therefore, in order for CPT to hold as a symmetry in Q 0 -cohomology, the ranks of the obstruction maps in the dual descriptions must match. In order to be more explicit, and to give a geometric interpretation to these obstructions, let us consider the two cases d = 1, 2 separately. Suppose d = 1, then all second degree cohomology groups on the base vanish, as well as obs 1 = obs 1 = 0.

Hence, we interpret (4.65) as an obstruction to extending an infinitesimal Kähler deformation of the base to an infinitesimal deformation of the bundle E → Y . This is a feature proper of a non-trivial hybrid model, and can be perhaps interpreted as the worldsheet version of the Kähler sub-structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. We notice that in all the examples we have considered, such obstructions always vanish. It would be interesting to determine whether this is always the case, but we have not being able to do so.

Here, CPT will hold as a symmetry in Q 0 -cohomology iff rank obs 0 = rank obs 1 , rank obs 1 = rank obs 0 . interpreted as infinitesimal complex structure deformations of the bundle E → Y . Hence, it is natural to interpret these maps as the hybrid version of the Atiyah class <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which captures an obstruction to the compatibility between a complex structure deformation of Y and a bundle deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Again, we remark that we do not know of an example in which nontrivial obstructions arise.</p><p>To conclude this section, we briefly comment on obstructions in twisted sectors for k &gt; 1. We have seen that in our (0,2) models, obstructions are compatible with CPT invariance precisely when (4.65) or (4.66) holds. A crucial fact for this to be allowed is the presence in both CPT conjugate sectors k = ±1 of the base fields ρ µ . In a generic twisted sector k &gt; 1, these modes do not appear, as we discussed at the beginning of this section. Thus, the argument of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> extends to our (0,2) models: CPT invariance is violated when non-trivial obstructions appear in twisted sectors k &gt; 1, as these cannot arise in the dual states in the dual sectors 2L − k.</p><p>Finally, simple energy considerations show that each monomial in Q J in the k sector generates the same action as the dual monomial in the 2L−k sector obtained by implementing (4.51). Thus, provided CPT is a symmetry in Q 0 -cohomology, it is also maintained as a symmetry by further taking Q J -cohomology, and therefore of the full Q cohomology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">An E 7 model</head><p>Our second example is going to reveal an interesting feature of our models. One of the assumptions for the correspondence between our UV model and the IR SCFT which we analyzed in section 3.3 consists in the absence of IR accidental symmetries <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In fact, if these occur, they can mix with the naïve U(1) UV R R-symmetry and c-extremization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> might select a different U(1) IR R . This can have drastic consequences on the structure of the conformal manifold, which in the most extreme case might be even empty, that is c = c IR , c = c IR is not satisfied for any choice of the parameters of the UV model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Outlook</head><p>In this work, we have constructed a class of models with (0,2) supersymmetry suitable for compactifications of the heterotic string, and described techniques to compute the massless spectrum in the limit where the Kähler class of the base is taken deep inside its Kähler cone. We have described some properties of these models, and most importantly we have provided evidence that supports the fact that there exist flows to the expected non-trivial fixed points in the IR. However, much work lies ahead of us! In this final section, we wish to outline what hybrid models can teach us about the structure of the moduli space of (0,2) SCFTs.</p><p>Let us start with the tamest class of (0,2) hybrids, namely models which admit a (2,2) locus. Here there are two kinds of deformations one might consider. First, we can have E = T Y and a (0,2) superpotential J ∈ Γ(E * ) which is not integrable to a (2,2) superpotential W . Second, there are bundle deformations, that is, E is a deformation of T Y . While the former set of deformations is quite well understood, the latter corresponds, in GLSM terminology, to E-deformations, which are far more mysterious <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. In particular, it would be extremely important to determine whether, among these, non-linear deformations are exactly marginal, redundant, or lifted by worldsheet instantons.</p><p>Next, one could consider, when possible, decreasing the rank of the map E defining the bundle E, thereby increasing its rank. It is natural to conjecture that this procedure corresponds to deforming to a Higgs branch of the theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, in the realm of (0,2) theories without a (2,2) locus, the most pressing question is how worldsheet instantons modify the classical picture as we move away from the hybrid limit. In theories with a (2,2) locus, such corrections, although there are indications that they do occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, are particularly elusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We expect this behavior to be significantly different in more general (0,2) theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. As we have seen in this work, the space of instantons in hybrid models is relatively simple since these are maps to the base B, and one can construct nontrivial models with a simple base, as a laboratory for exploring instanton corrections to the spacetime superpotential.</p><p>It would be also interesting to investigate further the connection between hybrids and GLSMs. It seems possible that a deeper understanding of the combinatorics we started in this work might lead to a new class of models along the lines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the example we studied in section 5.2 might prompt a revival of the quest of classifying (0,2) LG theories. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> show that if our interest is to classify IR fixed points of (0,2) LG theories, classifying non-singular superpotentials does not suffice due to the presence of accidents. However, we have seen that even accidental LG theories can be employed to construct accident-free hybrid models. If we conjecture that any (0,2) LG can be consistently hybridized, it would be also meaningful to have a classification of non-singular (0,2) LG superpotentials.</p><p>We plan to address some of these questions in future work.</p></div>

This particular choice for the map E forces F I = O(−1) for I = i = 1, 2, and we choose E B = T B = O(2). Since we are not going to build a full hybrid model out of this geometric set-up, only for this example we do not follow our conventions for the indices as in the rest of the work. Note that upon performing a GL(2, C) field redefinition of the φ's, it is possible to diagonalize the maps (4.41), recovering the (2,2) form E i = φ i . Hence, the bundle E defined by (4.41) is isomorphic to the tangent sheaf T Y . We are going to compute the sheaf cohomology of this (0,2) disguised tangent bundle and check our answer with the known result. If we assume that a, b, c, d = 0 then (4.41) implies ∆ ′ i = {(1, 0), (0, 1)} and δ i = {(0, 0), ±(1, −1)}. Thus, Π = {(r 1 , r 2 ) ∈ Z ⊕2 |r 2 = −r 1 } and (4.38) determines the coarse grading R by an integer L as follows</figDesc></figure>

When non-trivial, these maps lift each pairs of singlets, of which two chiral and two anti-chiral.
