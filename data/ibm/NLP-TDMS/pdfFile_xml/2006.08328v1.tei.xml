<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Online hate speech is a newborn problem in our modern society which is growing at a steady rate exploiting weaknesses of the corresponding regimes that characterise several social media platforms. Therefore, this phenomenon is mainly cultivated through such comments, either during users' interaction or on posted multimedia context. Nowadays, giant companies own platforms where many millions of users log in daily. Thus, protection of their users from exposure to similar phenomena for keeping up with the corresponding law, as well as for retaining a high quality of offered services, seems mandatory. Having a robust and reliable mechanism for identifying and preventing the uploading of related material would have a huge effect on our society regarding several aspects of our daily life. On the other hand, its absence would deteriorate heavily the total user experience, while its erroneous operation might raise several ethical issues. In this work, we present a protocol for creating a more suitable dataset, regarding its both informativeness and representativeness aspects, favouring the safer capture of hate speech occurrence, without at the same time restricting its applicability to other classification problems. Moreover, we produce and publish a textual dataset with two variants: binary and multi-label, called 'ETHOS', based on YouTube and Reddit comments validated through figure-eight crowdsourcing platform. Our assumption about the production of more compatible datasets is further investigated by applying various classification models and recording their behaviour over several appropriate metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Hate speech (HS) is a form of insulting public speech directed at specific individuals or groups of people on the basis of characteristics, such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This phenomenon is manifested either verbally or physically (e.g. speech, text, gestures) promoting the emergence of racism and ethnocentrism. Because of the social cost arising out of HS, several countries consider HS as an illegal act, particularly when it encourages violence or hatred <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. Although a fundamental human right, freedom of speech, it is actually in conflict with laws that protect people from HS. Therefore, almost every country has responded to this fact by drawing up corresponding legal frameworks, while the research which is related with mechanisms that try to remedy such phenomena have recently been really attractive to Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Another important issue is that the occurrence of HS phenomena is actually emerging in the social media's environment. The anonymity of social media is the main reason for favouring its spread avoiding deliberately the corresponding legislation. Big companies, like Google and Facebook, are therefore obliged to detect and remove such kind of content from their platforms. As a result, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies are required to detect and remove (semi-)automatically such content in real-time level, or even prevent users from publishing similar context with appropriate warnings or bans. The solution of quarantining in an online fashion has recently been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, trying to smooth the censorship and the possible harmful consequences of HS attacks. Naturally, AI methodologies require balanced, reliable and unbiased datasets in order to achieve high performances in real-life tasks. However, this requirement seldomly holds without applying proper manipulation stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This is the direction towards our work aims to highly contribute, motivated mainly by the use case of HS, but offering a generic-based protocol which could be applied to a broad range of learning applications.</p><p>To be more specific, there are currently a lot of HS datasets available at the related literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. However, since the majority of them were not manually constructed, phenomena of extremely imbalanced classes or redundant information may occur frequently, violating thus the previously mentioned desired requirements, leading to solutions that are characterised by low variance and/or high bias. Moreover, most of them concern binary classification or multiclass classification problems, ignoring the more realistic case of Multi-label classification (MLC), since an online comment may correspond to more than one existing labels at the same time rather than being restricted to exactly one outcome.</p><p>A simple application that would utilise the multi-label information provided by this dataset could be a support system for human personnel reviewing comments on social media platforms that may or may not contain HS. This would make it easier for the reviewer to determine whether the message included HS content provided such additional information. For example, if a comment is presented as targeting people with disabilities, is directed at an individual and promotes violence, it would be more useful for the reader in order to conclude and condemn it for containing HS, than to be presented with a single label, such as 'may contain HS':{'yes', 'no'}.</p><p>Regarding also the ethical issues that arise in case of HS, a proper manipulation protocol seems necessary for validating several defects that are met on the initially collected data, as other works have suggested in ML community, examining either wider topics of research or more targeted, like news articles or nutritional labels, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Similar directions have recently been investigated in the framework of HS detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we present the process of creating a multi-labelled dataset with a step-by-step narrative, to avoid the implications that usually occur in similar attempts with data that come from social platforms, as well as increase the chance of mining better and more informative insights from the corresponding instances. Although the nature of the proposed protocol is broad enough, without deterring us from applying it over diverse datasets' fields, at the present, we focus on tackling the HS scenario through exploiting an available dataset mined from popular social media platforms and obtaining later feedback from a well-known crowdsourcing platform. The effects of the proposed protocol are commented in depth and visualised through explanatory methods. Afterwards, a set of experiments are taking place in order to find a baseline performance of this specific dataset using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, ranging from conventional ML algorithms and ensemble learners to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with and without embeddings information, in both binary and multi-label scope, influenced mainly by other published works that also demonstrate approaches of producing appropriate datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Our ultimate ambition by describing the total procedure and providing the corresponding dataset is to foster any interested researchers and businesses to take into consideration an approach that attempts towards transforming the existing insulting environment of social media into a non-hate inclusive online society. Adoption of the proposed protocol into different scientific fields may also be proved quite beneficial, especially when the knowledge acquired by oracles during annotation may be disambiguous.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 contains some well-documented attempts of facing HS problem with instances that were collected from related sources. The proposed protocol is described next, while some extended single/multi-label classification experiments are placed in Section 4, revealing the discriminating ability of several examined algorithms. Finally, Section 5 discusses the more crucial assets of the proposed protocol, regarding also the recorded experiments, reporting later some remarkable future points that could be further investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED DATASETS</head><p>In this section, we present datasets related to HS, along with their formulation as well as some useful information about their structure and/or the manner under their composition took place. The last paragraph describes the Hatebusters' data that we utilise as a seed data through the proposed protocol to produce the final structure of data, named ETHOS (onlinE haTe speecH detectiOn dataSet).</p><p>A collection of 16,914 hate speech tweets was introduced in a study of how different features improve the identification of users that use analogous language online <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Out of the total number of messages, 3,383 concerned sexism and were sent by 613 users, 1,972 concerned racism and were sent by 9 users, and 11,559 did not include hate speech and were sent by 614 users. The corpus was generated by a manual tweet search, using the public Twitter API, containing popular slurs and terms related to sexual, religious, gender and ethnic minorities in order to include samples that are not offensive regardless of the inclusion of such words. A drawback of this dataset is that the text of the tweets is not directly accessible, but only through the Twitter API.</p><p>Another dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> contains 24,783 tweets, manually classified as hate speech (1,430), offensive but not hate speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr">190)</ref>, and neither hate nor offensive speech (4,163) by Figure Eight's (formerly CrowdFlower) members. The data was gathered via the Twitter API, filtering tweets containing HS words that Internet users submitted to Hatebase.org. The outcome was a sample of tweets from 33,548 Twitter users. 85.4 million tweets were collected from the accounts of all users. A random sample of this collection is the final dataset of 24,783 tweets. Nevertheless, this dataset lacks diversity in terms of HS content. For example, the gender-based hate speech tweets are biased towards women, while the greatest number of hate speech tweets contain ethnicity content.</p><p>Research focusing on the identification of misogynistic language on Twitter uses a dataset called Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with 4.000 annotated comments and their labels that define if they are misogynous or not. Apart from this binary labelling, every comment is defined by two extra fields. The first one concerns the type of misogynistic behaviour and takes the following values: stereotype, dominance, derailing, sexual harassment, discredit or none if the tweet is not misogynous. The second field concerns the subject of the misogynistic tweet and takes the following values: active, when it attacks a specific target (individual), passive, when it denotes potential receivers (generic), and again none, if there is no misogyny in the tweet.</p><p>The largest online community of white nationalists, called Stormfront, was used as the source of the dataset in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The content in this forum revolves around discussions of race, with various degrees of offensiveness, included. The annotation of the samples is at the sentence level, which is a technique that keeps the smallest unit containing hate speech and reduces noise. The dataset contains 10,568 sentences that are classified as hate speech (1,119 comments) or not (8,537 comments), as well as two supplementary classes, relation for sentences that express hate speech only when related to each other and skip for sentences which are not in English or do not contain any information as to be classified as hate speech or not. Furthermore, information like the post identifier and the sentenceâĂŹs position in the post, a user identifier and a sub-forum identifier, as well as the number of previous posts the annotator had to read before making a decision over the sentenceâĂŹs category are also recorded. The samples were picked randomly from 22 sub-forums covering diverse topics and nationalities.</p><p>The dataset introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> consists of 1,528 Fox News user comments (435 hateful), which were acquired from 10 discussion threads of 10 widely read Fox News articles published during August 2016. Context information is considered extremely important, so details such as the screen name of the user, all the comments in the same thread and the original article, are also included.</p><p>Another research direction is to investigate the detection of HS by mining data from non-English languages, either for developing monolingual ML models regarding their source languages, or for proposing multilingual solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. For the former case, more in-depth analysis of specialised idioms that govern low-resource languages is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>, while the latter case seems more challenging, favouring the exploitation of correlations that appear between distinct languages which may reveal useful insights, or even enable the face of code switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Reviewing the recently demonstrated multilingual work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, a trilingual dataset was created, including English, French and Arabic tweets, trying initially to mine similar expressions of 15 common phrases over the examined languages. After some modifications of the selected phrases, different sources of obscene phrases were searched, such as more sensitive topic-based discussions based on locality criteria. After the resolvement of some linguistic challenges that occur per separate language, and a strict rule set that was posed to human annotators from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to ensure trustworthy feedback, a pilot test set was provided. Having gathered the necessary evaluations, another one reconstruction of the label set was applied, before the final formulation of 5,647 English, 4,014 French and 3,353 Arabic tweets was reached, annotated over 5 separate tasks. Apart from the directness of each tweet, which was a binary label and was tackled better by single task language models, the rest 4 tasks included at least 5 label gradiations and their classification via multi task single/multi language or single/multi multilingual models was clearly boosted.</p><p>Finally, a small collection of 454 YouTube comments annotated as hate speech (120) or not (334) was introduced by the creators of the Hatebusters Platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which aims to establish an online inclusive community of volunteers actively reporting illegal hate speech content on YouTube. This dataset, through semi-supervised learning, was evolving in the Hatebusters Platform improving the classification accuracy of the ML models. However, this unpremeditated expansion of the dataset led to a more redundant variant of its original form. We use the initial collection of Hatebusters data as a seed to the protocol that we propose in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ETHOS DATASET CREATION</head><p>In order to overcome the key weaknesses of the existing HS datasets, we introduce a small, yet fairly, informative dataset, ETHOS, that does not suffer from issues such as imbalanced or biased labels (e.g. gender), produced appropriately following the proposed protocol. Considering the aforementioned popular approaches of mining similar datasets for tackling with HS problem, we assume that an appropriate pre-process of such kind of initially collected data could improve in general their overall utilisation under ML or AI learning products, improving the total fitness of data quality, blending data mining techniques related with the field of Active Learning (AL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, such as query strategy and crowdsourcing platforms. The overview of the proposed protocol is visualised through a flow chart in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. More specialised comments are placed in the following subsections. The finally obtained dataset is the outcome of a 3-stage process, which we describe shortly in the current Section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Stage 1-Initial Dataset Creation and Manual Annotation</head><p>The first three procedures, mentioned as "Platform Selection &amp; Data Collection", "Data Prediction" and "Manual Data Annotation", could be seen as the initial stage which is executed until a stopping criterion is satisfied regarding the cardinality of the collected instances, based on the original available HS dataset which operates as the input. This stage works like a "stream", specifically for groups of comments that we have already collected, annotating their weak labels' predictions through a predefined ML classifier, before an active selection and manually annotation takes place over some unlabelled U mined examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Platform Selection &amp; Data Collection.</head><p>To create this dataset (D), initially D = ∅, a data collection protocol has been designed.</p><p>We chose the platforms of Hatebusters 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Reddit through the Public Reddit Data Repository 2 to collect our data. Hatebusters Platform collects new data every day via the YouTube Data v3 API. After these new data have been collected, the Hatebusters Platform performs the classification process. The locally retained pre-trained ML model predicts the class of each comment, exporting a 'hate' score. Currently, this model is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> model with a linear kernel embedded with the well-known vectorization technique of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the input data, this first part was to query the Hatebusters database for comments already annotated by the corresponding users, without spending any monetisation resources. These comments seemed to be accurate, and they were the first group of comments to be manually annotated. The second part concerns the enrichment of the initially gathered comments, by querying Hatebusters' database with a specific frequency (e.g. daily) for a time period-in our case this was equal to two months-with various queries. However, based on the data we obtained each previous day, the applied queries have been updated concerning only the last day. For example, when we received a sufficient amount for all categories of HS, except for one category, the queries in the Hatebusters database were updated to make comments specific to the residual category. Later on, we will show the categories and the amount of comments we have received.</p><p>The final part of the data collection process was based on a public Reddit data archive, which provides batches of files regarding Reddit comments on a monthly basis. The files of this directory were processed through a JSON crawler for selecting comments from specific subreddits for particular time periods. The discovery of subreddits incorporating different HS contents has been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>, we distinguished the next entities:</p><p>• Incels: This subreddit became known as a place where men blamed women for their unintended celibacy, often promoting rape or other abuse. Those posts had a misogynistic and sometimes racist content. This subreddit was terminated on 7 November 2017. • TheRedPill: TheRedpill is a subreddit devoted to the rights of men, containing material of a misogynous character. • The_Donald: The_Donald is a subreddit where the participants create discussions and memes supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump. This subreddit has been described as hosting conspiracy theories and content that is racist, misogynous, Islamophobic, and antisemitic. • RoastMe: In this subreddit, reddit users can ask subreddit followers to 'roast' them, namely to insult them.</p><p>While some of these subreddits were suspended and shut down by Reddit at the end of 2017 due to their context, it was possible to access comments from these subreddits by selecting files from the archive for October 2017 and earlier.</p><p>3.1.2 Data Prediction. The second process of the Stage 1 is the "Data Prediction". For each batch of comments extracted from the first stage, the assignment of some useful labels to the available 1 https://hatebusters.org 2 https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/ unlabelled set (U cur r ent ) is triggered through an ML model trained on an expanded version (L ∪ D) of the Hatebusters' dataset (L) and the new data annotated on Stage 3 (D). In every iteration of Stage 1, we were performing a grid search among a bunch of classification methods in the currently expanded dataset, for obtaining the best algorithm examining its efficacy through a typical 10-fold-CV process so as to be selected as the annotator of the (U cur r ent ).</p><p>Among these grid searches, we evaluated various ML models, such as SVMs, Random Forests (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), as well as some simple or more complex architectures of Neural Networks (NNs). In addition to the classifier tuning, several vectorization techniques were also examined in this search, such as TF-IDF vectorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> with word or char n-grams (n from 1 to 13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Manual Data Annotation.</head><p>By the end of the "Data Prediction" phase, the "Data Annotation" process is initiated. In the sense of AL concept, using a combination of Query Strategies, similar to Uncertainty Sampling and Maximum Relevance with predefined ranges of accepted confidence values based on the expected labels of the classifier we trained in the previous step, we pick informative comments for manual annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. More specifically, we were selecting for annotation the comments within the [.4, .6] probability range, while we were examining few comments in the ranges [.0, .1] ∪ [.9, 1.0] to detect any major misclassification. Eventually, only comments with specific labels and content were added to the new dataset (D) in order to preserve both the balance of the labels and the diversity of the comments per label. At the end of this process, if the number of comments collected is not more than 1000, we will update the D, and Stage 1 will be repeated to request new unlabelled comments. Otherwise, Stage 2 will be triggered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Stage 2-Data Validation via Figure-Eight Platform</head><p>The second stage will begin when the 1000 comments have been collected. Moreover, the Hatebusters' dataset is discarded, since it does not further contribute to our protocol. After a number of different experiments on the Figure-Eight Platform, we settled on the following technique. Firstly, given a specific comment, we ask the contributors to identify whether that comment contains HS or not. If the comment contains HS, then we raise 3 more questions: i) whether the comment incites violence, defining violence as "the use of physical force to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy", ii) whether the comment includes directed or generalized hate speech. The case of targeting a single person or a small group of people is defined as directed HS, whereas the case of targeting a class or a large group of people is described as generalised HS. Finally, we ask the contributors to pick one or more from the following hate speech categories, which, according to their opinion, better reflect the content of the comments. The categories of HS concern gender, race, national origin, disability, religion and sexual orientation. Through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, an example of the designed query template on the crowdsourcing platform is presented, depicting the types of questions and potential responses. With respect to the proposed template, we introduced a set of 40 questions for validating the trustworthiness of human annotators, as well as a test run of 100 unlabelled comments, with 3 different contributors determining the labels for each one of these. The feedback we collected helped us to finalise some design and instruction issues. Most importantly, we have fixed some naive and few serious mistakes on the validation questions, such as the following:</p><p>[naive mistake]: For the comment "Jews are lower class pigs. " we had 'Yes' on question 'Does this comment incites violence?', while we gave as an explanation "It spreads hatred, but not violence".</p><p>[serious mistake]: We misclassified the comment "Queers are an abomination and need to be helped to go straight to Hell!" to the wrong category. By receiving the feedback we fixed it.</p><p>Then, we executed the task for the whole D, collecting 5,360 judgements. Almost every comment was therefore annotated by five different annotators. The level of expertise of the annotators was the 3rd, on a scale of 3 levels. "The 3rd level annotators are the smallest group of the most experienced, most accurate, contributors" according to the <ref type="figure">Figure-</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Stage 3-Dataset Configuration</head><p>The third and final stage is the configuration of the dataset. Taking as input the results from the second stage, the dataset takes its final form. Examining the annotated data one last time manually, we checked for any mistake or misclassification. Few errors occurred on some of the most disambiguous examples, assuring us about the quality of the annotators that participated in our task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">ETHOS Dataset Overview</head><p>Two datasets 3 were the product of the above operation. The first one, "Ethos_Dataset_Binary.csv", includes 998 comments and a label on the presence or absence of hate speech content ('isHate'). The second file, called "Ethos_Dataset_Multi_Label.csv", includes 433 hate speech messages along with the following 8 labels: ('violence', 'directed_vs_generalized', 'gender', 'race', 'national_origin', 'disability', 'sexual_orientation', 'religion').</p><p>For every comment c i , N i annotators voted for the labels that we set. The label 'isHate' was the result of summing up the positive votes P 1,i of the contributors, divided by N i , so its values 3 https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Ethos-Hate-Speech-Dataset are within the range of [0, 1]. We measured the 'violence' label by summarising the positive votes of the contributors P 2,i to the question: "Does this comment incite violence?", which was divided by P 1,i to be normalised to [0, 1]. Likewise, the value of the label 'directed_vs_generalized' was determined by summarising the annotators replied 'directed' P 3,i to the question, "Is this comment targeting a specific individual (directed) or a group/class of people (generalized)?", divided by P 1,i . Finally, we accumulated the votes of the P 1,i contributors for each of the 6 hate speech categories, and dividing them by P 1,i , we obtained six independent labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3: Ratio of labels</head><p>This dataset achieves to create labels with balanced classes. In particular, it maintains balance between the two classes of 'isHate' label almost perfect balance between the 6 labels of hate speech categories, while it has a fair ratio between the other labels too <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the balance between hate speech categories (last column) and their correlation with violence and directed/generalized labels is further portrayed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Gender  14  22  13  37  86  Race  4  13  12  47  76  National Origin  5  11  18  40  74  Disability  12  15  8  18  53  Religion  11  8  24  38  81  Sexual Orientation  11  15  11  36  73  57  84  86  216  443   Table 1</ref>: Correlation of HS categories with violence (V)/not violence (nV) and directed (D)/generalized (G) labels</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DATASET EVALUATION</head><p>In order to evaluate ETHOS, after pre-processing the data, we used a variety of different algorithms in binary and multi-label scope to present the performance of the baseline models in this dataset. For the purpose of providing the unbiased performance of each algorithm, we performed nested-CV <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> evaluation for every algorithm except NNs, where we applied 10-fold-CV <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In addition, we binarise the values of each label, which are initially discrete in a range of [0,1], to the {0,1} classes using the rule "If value ≥ 0.5 → 1 Else value → 0". More in-depth details are provided next.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Pre-processing</head><p>The pre-processing methodology used in our case begins with lowercasing transformation, contraction transformations ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2)</ref>, removal of punctuation marks, stemming and lemmatization via Snow-ball stemmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> and WordNet lemmatizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Phrases and words transformations âĂĲwhat'sâĂİ to âĂĲwhat isâĂİ âĂĲ'llâĂİ to âĂĲ willâĂİ âĂĲ'sâĂİ to âĂĲ isâĂİ âĂĲdon'tâĂİ to âĂĲdo notâĂİ âĂĲi'mâĂİ to âĂĲi amâĂİ âĂĲ'veâĂİ to âĂĲ haveâĂİ âĂĲdoesn'tâĂİ to âĂĲdoes notâĂİ âĂĲhe'sâĂİ to âĂĲhe isâĂİ âĂĲisn'tâĂİ to âĂĲis notâĂİ âĂĲthat'sâĂİ to âĂĲthat isâĂİ âĂĲshe'sâĂİ to âĂĲshe isâĂİ âĂĲ'reâĂİ to âĂĲ areâĂİ âĂĲaren'tâĂİ to âĂĲare notâĂİ âĂĲit'sâĂİ to âĂĲit isâĂİ âĂĲ'dâĂİ to âĂĲ wouldâĂİ âĂĲ%âĂİ to âĂĲ percentâĂİ âĂĲe-mailâĂİ to âĂĲe mailâĂİ </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Vectorization and Word Embeddings</head><p>Before we proceed to the classification experiments, we have to transform the pre-processed textual data into word vectors. The applied methodologies for these transformations are the TF-IDF Vectorizer and the Text-to-Sequences. Particularly, for the former, several parameter tuples of (n_gram, max_features, stopwords existence) were examined, while on the latter, we set the corresponding number of maximum features at 50,000. Furthermore, 4 pre-trained models that concern computation of embeddings were included: FastText (FT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, GloVe (GV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, a combination of FastText and Glove, as well as Bert Language Model (BERT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Binary Classification</head><p>A lot of applications approach the problem of HS detection through a binary scope. It is therefore necessary to present the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on the binary version of this dataset before proceeding with the multi-label classification experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Algorithms.</head><p>We used the following algorithms for our experiments in the binary level: Multinomial and Bernoulli variations of Naive Bayes (MNB and BNB, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>, LR and Ridge Regression as well, SVMs, Decision Trees (DTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, RF, AdaBoost (Ada) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Gradient Boosting (Grad) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Moreover, we used six different NN architectures, as other similar works attempt <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. The first one utilises convolutional NNs (CNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> with an attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> layer. The second is a compilation of CNNs and long short-term memory NNs (LSTMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. A single LSTM-based NN constitutes the third architecture. The fourth model is an NN with multiple parallel layers, which contain CNNs, LSTMs and Feed-Forward layers (FFs). The last two architectures are Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) without and with attention layers, respectively. We combined these NNs with FT and GV. Lastly, we used BERT language model, which was fine-tuned in our classification task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Metrics.</head><p>The metrics that we have chosen are accuracy and precision, recall and F1-score with macro indication, as well as the confusion matrix. Furthermore, we calculate specificity T N /N , which measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of comments without HS content who are correctly identified as not containing HS) as well as sensitivity T P/P, which measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of HS comments who are correctly identified as containing HS). However, in applications like HS monitoring where human interference is essential to ensure that users' rights are not abused on the grounds of incorrect HS charges, we must rely on metrics such as high recall and precision of HS category that they could guarantee to not overwhelm the human personnel on checking redundant content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.3</head><p>Results. The handling of textual data is a thoroughly researched task and has a dedicated category, NLP, which stands for natural language processing. We used common and widely accepted techniques to process our textual data, utilising TF-IDF vectorizers, pre-trained embeddings and language models. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Performance of selected models on multi-label HS classification (P: Precision, R: Recall, AP: Average Precision) this performance using fine-tuning on the dataset, validating its superior performance on similar tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Multi-Label Classification</head><p>Providing a dataset with multi-label information about HS, we accomplish to uncover new possible applications. HS is indeed an ML task that cannot be completely studied just through the binary aspect. Indeed, it is a multi-dimensional task involving, for example, the presence of violence in the HS Act. Another dimension may be whether the target of the act is directed or generalised, as well as the HS category to which it is oriented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Algorithms.</head><p>The algorithms handling multi-label data can be either problem transformation techniques or adaptation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. MlkNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> and MLARAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> adaptation methods, as well as Binary Relevance (BR) and Classifier Chains (CC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> transformation methods with base classification models like LR, SVMs and RF, are utilised. We used FT embeddings for our NNs architectures and designed models inspired by classic MLC systems, such as BR and CC. Specifically, NNBR is an NN containing BiLSTMs, an attention layer, two FFs and an output layer with 8 outputs in a BR fashion. The NNCC architecture is inspired by the CC technique and is quite similar to the NNBR except for the output where each label is given as input for the next label prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Metrics.</head><p>In the evaluation of MLC systems, a very common measure is the Hamming loss which measures the symmetric difference between the ground truth labels and the predicted ones. Furthermore, subset accuracy measuring symmetric similarity, as well as precision, recall and F1-score, are contained here. These evaluation metrics are instance-based. Moreover, it is necessary to compute some label-based metrics like B-macro and B-micro, where B ∈ {F1, Precision, Recall}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Results.</head><p>After testing this multi-label dataset using nested CV for MLkNN, MLARAM, CC and BR models, and 10-fold-CV for NNs, we are presenting the performance of each approach in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. We observe again the superior performance of neuralbased approaches compared to classical ML techniques. Specifically, NNBR achieves the highest score in 12 out of 13 metrics, while we kept the same highlighting strategy as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>The provision of a new well-designed dataset to the public on a specific subject is always considered to be a significant contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. In this sense, this multi-labelled dataset on HS, which we call ETHOS, collected from various social media, could be reused by other researchers or even industries for a wide variety of tasks regarding binary/multi-class and/or multi-label classification.</p><p>In addition, the exported dataset can be combined with other similar HS datasets for evaluation reasons, or even for the development of hybrid Weakly supervised HS detection models, merging Semi-supervised and AL strategies under common frameworks, alleviating the human intervention based on decisions over the gathered unlabelled instances that come solely from the side of a robust learner <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48]</ref>. Online HS detection and prevention tools such as Hatebusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, among others, would be able to use this dataset to build better performing classifiers and use the category labels of this dataset to better assign comments to HS categories.</p><p>Another application, which appears to be beneficial to reviewers on social media platforms, might use the multi-labelled nature of this dataset to provide suggestions for comments containing HS, the level of violence, the target of comments and the categories of HS that are present in each comment. All this information could be very helpful to the reviewers, assisting them to conclude, without a doubt, the existence of HS in a comment.</p><p>However, this is not a multi-purpose HS detection dataset, as the data on which the comments are based are found in social media. This means that the corpora will have relatively small sentences. Thus, models trained on this dataset may fail to detect HS in documents of a larger scale without segmentation. On the other hand, the general structure of the proposed protocol could be applied to a variety of learning tasks , especially when they are based on large databases, since the proper exploitation of human expertise or crowdsourcing options could benefit them from more accurate predictions and less intensive annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Dataset creation stages flowchart</figDesc></figure>
