<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Self-attention-based architectures, in particular Transformers <ref type="bibr">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>, have become the model of choice in natural language processing (NLP). The dominant approach is to pre-train on a large text corpus and then fine-tune on a smaller task-specific dataset <ref type="bibr">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>. Thanks to Transformers' computational efficiency and scalability, it has become possible to train models of unprecedented size, with over 100B parameters. With the models and datasets growing, there is still no sign of saturating performance.</p><p>In computer vision, however, convolutional architectures remain dominant <ref type="bibr">(LeCun et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krizhevsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">He et al., 2016)</ref>. Inspired by NLP successes, multiple works try combining CNN-like architectures with self-attention <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carion et al., 2020)</ref>, some replacing the convolutions entirely <ref type="bibr">(Ramachandran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020a)</ref>. The latter models, while theoretically efficient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to the use of specialized attention patterns. Therefore, in large-scale image recognition, classic ResNetlike architectures are still state of the art <ref type="bibr">(Mahajan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Xie et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, we experiment with applying a standard Transformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modifications. To do so, we split an image into patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Transformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. We train the model on image classification in supervised fashion.</p><p>When trained on mid-sized datasets such as ImageNet, such models yield modest accuracies of a few percentage points below ResNets of comparable size. This seemingly discouraging outcome may be expected: Transformers lack some of the inductive biases inherent to CNNs, such as translation equivariance and locality, and therefore do not generalize well when trained on insufficient amounts of data.</p><p>However, the picture changes if the models are trained on larger datasets (14M-300M images). We find that large scale training trumps inductive bias. Our Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results when pre-trained at sufficient scale and transferred to tasks with fewer datapoints. When pre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset or the in-house JFT-300M dataset, ViT approaches or beats state of the art on multiple image recognition benchmarks. In particular, the best model reaches the accuracy of 88.55% on ImageNet, 90.72% on ImageNet-ReaL, 94.55% on CIFAR-100, and 77.63% on the VTAB suite of 19 tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Transformers were proposed by <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref> for machine translation, and have since become the state of the art method in many NLP tasks. Large Transformer-based models are often pre-trained on large corpora and then fine-tuned for the task at hand: <ref type="bibr">BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> uses a denoising self-supervised pre-training task, while the GPT line of work uses language modeling as its pre-training task <ref type="bibr">(Radford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Naive application of self-attention to images would require that each pixel attends to every other pixel. With quadratic cost in the number of pixels, this does not scale to realistic input sizes. Thus, to apply Transformers in the context of image processing, several approximations have been tried in the past: <ref type="bibr">Parmar et al. (2018)</ref> applied the self-attention only in local neighborhoods for each query pixel instead of globally. Such local multi-head dot-product self attention blocks can completely replace convolutions <ref type="bibr">(Ramachandran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cordonnier et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zhao et al., 2020)</ref>. Alternatively, works such as Sparse Transformers <ref type="bibr">(Child et al., 2019)</ref> employ scalable approximations to global self-attention in order to be applicable to images. An alternative way to scale attention is to apply it in blocks of varying sizes <ref type="bibr">(Weissenborn et al., 2019)</ref>, in the extreme case only along individual axes <ref type="bibr">(Ho et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020a)</ref>. Many of these specialized attention architectures demonstrate promising results on computer vision tasks, but require complex engineering to be implemented efficiently on hardware accelerators.</p><p>There has also been a lot of interest in combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with forms of self-attention, e.g. by augmenting feature maps for image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bello et al., 2019)</ref> or by further processing the output of a CNN using self-attention, e.g. for object detection <ref type="bibr">(Hu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carion et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">), video processing (Wang et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun et al., 2019)</ref>, image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Wu et al., 2020)</ref>, unsupervised object discovery <ref type="bibr">(Locatello et al., 2020)</ref>, or unified text-vision tasks <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2020c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>We are not aware of prior application of Transformers with global self-attention to full-sized images. Closest to our model is iGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2020a)</ref>, which applies Transformers to image pixels after reducing image resolution and color space. The model is trained in an unsupervised fashion as a generative model, and the resulting representation can then be fine-tuned or probed linearly for classification performance, achieving a maximal accuracy of 72% on ImageNet.</p><p>Our work adds to the increasing collection of papers that explore image recognition at larger scales than the standard ImageNet dataset. The use of additional data sources allows to achieve state-ofthe-art results on standard benchmarks <ref type="bibr">(Mahajan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Touvron et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Xie et al., 2020</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Model overview. We split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed each of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable "classification token" to the sequence. The illustration of the Transformer encoder was inspired by <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">VISION TRANSFORMER (VIT)</head><p>An overview of the model is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x ∈ R H×W ×C into a sequence of flattened 2D patches x p ∈ R N ×(P 2 ·C) , where (H, W ) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P, P ) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we flatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.</p><p>Similar to BERT's [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embedded patches (z 0 0 = x class ), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z 0 L ) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and fine-tuning, a classification head is attached to z 0 L . The classification head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at fine-tuning time.</p><p>Position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use standard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed significant performance gains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.3). The resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.</p><p>The Transformer encoder <ref type="bibr">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> consists of alternating layers of multiheaded selfattention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before every block, and residual connections after every block <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baevski &amp; Auli, 2019)</ref>. The MLP contains two layers with a GELU non-linearity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z 0 = [x class ; x 1 p E; x 2 p E; · · · ; x N p E] + E pos , E ∈ R (P 2 ·C)×D , E pos ∈ R (N +1)×D (1) z = MSA(LN(z −1 )) + z −1 , = 1 . . . L (2) z = MLP(LN(z )) + z , = 1 . . . L (3) y = LN(z 0 L )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Hybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a <ref type="bibr">CNN (LeCun et al., 1989)</ref>. In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply flattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension. The classification input embedding and position embeddings are added as described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">FINE-TUNING AND HIGHER RESOLUTION</head><p>Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D × K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneficial to fine-tune at higher resolution than pre-training <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al., 2020)</ref>. When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints), however, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original image. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an inductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the hybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size and evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the model, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at a lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show that self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">SETUP</head><p>Datasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with 21k classes and 14M images <ref type="bibr">(Deng et al., 2009), and</ref><ref type="bibr">JFT (Sun et al., 2017)</ref> with 18k classes and 303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the downstream tasks following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>. We transfer the models trained on these dataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the original validation labels and the cleaned-up ReaL labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beyer et al., 2020)</ref>, CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets <ref type="bibr">(Parkhi et al., 2012)</ref>, and Oxford Flowers-102 <ref type="bibr">(Nilsback &amp; Zisserman, 2008)</ref>. For these datasets, pre-processing follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>.</p><p>We also evaluate on the 19-task VTAB classification suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Zhai et al., 2019b)</ref>. VTAB evaluates low-data transfer to diverse tasks, using 1 000 training examples per task. The tasks are divided into three groups: Natural -tasks like the above, Pets, CIFAR, etc. Specialized -medical and satellite imagery, and Structured -tasks that require geometric understanding like localization.</p><p>Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT <ref type="bibr">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, as summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. The "Base" and "Large" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger "Huge" model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the "Large" variant with 16 × 16 input patch size. Note that the Transformer's sequence length is inversely proportional to the square of the patch size, thus models with smaller patch size are computationally more expensive.</p><p>For the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization layers <ref type="bibr">(Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015)</ref> with Group Normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Wu &amp; He, 2018)</ref>, and used standardized convolutions <ref type="bibr">(Salimans &amp; Kingma, 2016)</ref>. These modifications improve transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Kolesnikov et al., 2020)</ref>, and we denote the modified model "ResNet (BiT)". For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate feature maps into ViT with patch size of one "pixel". To experiment with different sequence lengths, we either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular ResNet50 or (ii) remove stage 4, place the same number of layers in stage 3 (keeping the total number of layers), and take the output of this extended stage 3. Option (ii) results in a 4x longer sequence length, and a more expensive ViT model.</p><p>Training &amp; Fine-tuning. We train all models, including ResNets, using Adam with β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.999, a batch size of 4096 and apply a high weight decay of 0.1, which we found to be useful   for transfer of all models (Appendix D.1 shows that, in contrast to common practices, Adam works slightly better than SGD for ResNets in our setting). We use a linear learning rate warmup and decay, see Appendix B.1 for details. For fine-tuning we use SGD with momentum, batch size 512, for all models, see Appendix B.1.1. For ImageNet results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we fine-tuned at higher resolution: Metrics. We report results on downstream datasets either through few-shot or fine-tuning accuracy. Fine-tuning accuracies capture the performance of each model after fine-tuning it on the respective dataset. Few-shot accuracies are obtained by solving a regularized linear regression problem that maps the (frozen) representation of a subset of training images to {−1, 1} K target vectors. Though we mainly focus on fine-tuning performance, we sometimes use linear few-shot accuracies for fast on-the-fly evaluation where fine-tuning would be too costly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">COMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART</head><p>We first compare our largest models -ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/16 -to state-of-the-art CNNs from the literature. The first comparison point is Big Transfer (BiT) (Kolesnikov et al., 2020), which performs supervised transfer learning with large ResNets. The second is Noisy Student <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Xie et al., 2020)</ref>, which is a large EfficientNet trained using semi-supervised learning on ImageNet and JFT-300M with the labels removed. Currently, Noisy Student is the state of the art on ImageNet and BiT-L on the other datasets reported here. All models were trained on TPUv3 hardware, and we report the number of TPUv3-core-days taken to pre-train each of them, that is, the number of TPU v3 cores (2 per chip) used for training multiplied by the training time in days. First, we pre-train ViT models on datasets of increasing size: ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M. To get the best possible performance on the smaller datasets, we optimize three regularization parameters -weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the results after fine-tuning to ImageNet (results on other datasets are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>) 2 . <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> contains the results of fine-tuning on ImageNet. When pre-trained on the smallest dataset, ImageNet, ViT-Large models underperform compared to ViT-Base models, despite heavy regularization. However, with ImageNet-21k pre-training, their performances are similar. Only with JFT-300M, do we see the full benefit of larger models. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> also shows the performance region spanned by BiT models of different sizes. The BiT CNNs outperform ViT on ImageNet (despite regularization optimization), but with the larger datasets, ViT overtakes.  Second, we train our models on random subsets of 9M, 30M, and 90M as well as the full JFT-300M dataset. We do not perform additional regularization on the smaller subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full finetuning accuracy. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> contains the results. Vision Transformers overfit more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly faster than ResNet50; it performs much worse on the 9M subset, but better on 90M+ subsets. The same is true for ResNet152x2 and ViT-L/16. This result reinforces the intuition that the convolutional inductive bias is useful for smaller datasets, but for larger ones, learning the relevant patterns is sufficient, even beneficial.</p><p>Overall, the few-shot results on ImageNet <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>, as well as the low-data results on VTAB <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref> seem promising for very low-data transfer. Further analysis of few-shot properties of ViT is an exciting direction of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">SCALING STUDY</head><p>We perform a controlled scaling study of different models by evaluating transfer performance from JFT-300M. In this setting data size does not bottleneck the models' performances, and we assess performance versus pre-training cost of each model. The model set includes: 7 ResNets, R50x1, R50x2 R101x1, R152x1, R152x2, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus R152x2 and R200x3 pre-trained for 14 epochs; 6 Vision Transformers, ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus L/16 and H/14 pre-trained for 14 epochs; and 5 hybrids, R50+ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16 pretrained for 7 epochs, plus R50+ViT-L/16 pre-trained for 14 epochs (for hybrids, the number at the end of the model name stands not for the patch size, but for the total dowsampling ratio in the ResNet backbone).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> in the Appendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the performance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2 − 4× less compute to attain the same performance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small computational budgets, but the difference vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision Transformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">INSPECTING VISION TRANSFORMER</head><p>To begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes image data, we analyze its internal representations. The first layer of the Vision Transformer linearly projects the flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> (left) shows the top principal components of the the learned embedding filters. The components resemble plausible basis functions for a low-dimensional representation of the fine structure within each patch. After the projection, a learned position embedding is added to the patch representations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> (center) shows that the model learns to encode distance within the image in the similarity of position embeddings, i.e. closer patches tend to have more similar position embeddings. Further, the row-column structure appears; patches in the same row/column have similar embeddings. Finally, a sinusoidal structure is sometimes apparent for larger grids (Appendix D). That the position embeddings learn to represent 2D image topology explains why hand-crafted 2D-aware embedding variants do not yield improvements (Appendix D.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input Attention</head><p>Self-attention allows ViT to integrate information across the entire image even in the lowest layers. We investigate to what degree the network makes use of this capability. Specifically, we compute the average distance in image space across which information is integrated, based on the attention weights <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 7, right)</ref>. This "attention distance" is analogous to receptive field size in CNNs. We find that some heads attend to most of the image already in the lowest layers, showing that the ability to integrate information globally is indeed used by the model. Other attention heads have consistently small attention distances in the low layers. This highly localized attention is less pronounced in hybrid models that apply a ResNet before the Transformer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 7, right</ref>), suggesting that it may serve a similar function as early convolutional layers in CNNs. Further, the attention distance increases with network depth. Globally, we find that the model attends to image regions that are semantically relevant for classification ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">SELF-SUPERVISION</head><p>Transformers show impressive performance on NLP tasks. However, much of their success stems not only from their excellent scalability but also from large scale self-supervised pre-training <ref type="bibr">(Devlin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Radford et al., 2018)</ref>. We also perform a preliminary exploration on masked patch prediction for self-supervision, mimicking the masked language modeling task used in BERT. With self-supervised pre-training, our smaller ViT-B/16 model achieves 79.9% accuracy on ImageNet, a significant improvement of 2% to training from scratch, but still 4% behind supervised pre-training. Appendix B.1.2 contains further details. We leave exploration of contrastive pre-training <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr">He et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bachman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hénaff et al., 2020)</ref> to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have explored the direct application of Transformers to image recognition. Unlike prior works using self-attention in computer vision, we do not introduce any image-specific inductive biases into the architecture. Instead, we interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. This simple, yet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre-training on large datasets. Thus, Vision Transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classification datasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre-train.</p><p>While these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. One is to apply ViT to other computer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. Our results, coupled with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carion et al. (2020)</ref>, indicate the promise of this approach. Another challenge is to continue exploring selfsupervised pre-training methods. Our initial experiments show improvement from self-supervised pre-training, but there is still large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pretraining. Finally, further scaling of ViT would likely lead to improved performance.   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2017)</ref>) is a popular building block for neural architectures. For each element in an input sequence z ∈ R N ×D , we compute a weighted sum over all values v in the sequence. The attention weights A ij are based on the pairwise similarity between two elements of the sequence and their respective query q i and key k j representations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[q, k, v] = zU qkv U qkv ∈ R D×3D h ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">A = softmax qk / D h A ∈ R N ×N ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>SA(z) = Av .</p><p>Multihead self-attention (MSA) is an extension of SA in which we run k self-attention operations, called "heads", in parallel, and project their concatenated outputs. To keep compute and number of parameters constant when changing k, D h (Eq. 5) is typically set to D/k. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> summarizes our training setups for our different models. We found strong regularization to be key when training models from scratch on ImageNet. Dropout, when used, is applied after every dense layer except for the the qkv-projections and directly after adding positional-to patch embeddings. Hybrid models are trained with the exact setup as their ViT counterparts. Finally, all training is done on resolution 224.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">MSA(z) = [SA 1 (z); SA 2 (z); · · · ; SA k (z)] U msa U msa ∈ R k·D h ×D (8) B EXPERIMENT DETAILS B.1 TRAINING</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1.1 FINE-TUNING</head><p>We fine-tune all ViT models using SGD with a momentum of 0.9. We run a small grid search over learning rates, see learning rate ranges in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>: Hyperparameters for fine-tuning. All models are fine-tuned with cosine learning rate decay, a batch size of 512, no weight decay, and grad clipping at global norm 1. If not mentioned otherwise, fine-tuning resolution is 384.</p><p>for ResNets we also run the setup of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref> and select the best results across this run and our sweep. Finally, if not mentioned otherwise, all fine-tuning experiments run at 384 resolution (running fine-tuning at different resolution than training is common practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Kolesnikov et al., 2020)</ref>).</p><p>When transferring ViT models to another dataset, we remove the whole head (two linear layers) and replace it by a single, zero-initialized linear layer outputting the number of classes required by the target dataset. We found this to be a little more robust than simply re-initializing the very last layer.</p><p>For VTAB we follow the protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>, and use the same hyperparameter setting for all tasks. We use a learning rate of 0.01 and train for 2500 steps (Tab. 4). We chose this setting by running a small sweep over two learning rates and two schedules, and selecting the setting with the highest VTAB score on the 200-example validation sets. We follow the pre-processing used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>, except that we do not use task-specific input resolutions. Instead we find that Vision Transformer benefits most from a high resolution (384 × 384) for all tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1.2 SELF-SUPERVISION</head><p>We employ the masked patch prediction objective for preliminary self-supervision experiments. To do so we corrupt 50% of patch embeddings by either replacing their embeddings with a learnable [mask] embedding (80%), a random other patch embedding (10%) or just keeping them as is (10%). This setup is very similar to the one used for language by <ref type="bibr">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>. Finally, we predict the 3-bit, mean color (i.e., 512 colors in total) of every corrupted patch using their respective patch representations.</p><p>We trained our self-supervised model for 1M steps (ca. 14 epochs) with batch size 4096 on JFT. We use Adam, with a base learning rate of 2 · 10 −4 , warmup of 10k steps and cosine learning rate decay. As prediction targets for pretraining we tried the following settings: 1) predicting only the mean, 3bit color (i.e., 1 prediction of 512 colors), 2) predicting a 4 × 4 downsized version of the 16 × 16 patch with 3bit colors in parallel (i.e., 16 predictions of 512 colors), 3) regression on the full patch using L2 (i.e., 256 regressions on the 3 RGB channels). Surprisingly, we found that all worked quite well, though L2 was slightly worse. We report final results only for option 1) because it has shown best few-shot performance. We also experimented with 15% corruption rate as used by Devlin et al.</p><p>(2019) but results were also slightly worse on our few-shot metrics.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to remark that our instantiation of masked patch prediction doesn't require such an enormous amount of pretraining nor a large dataset such as JFT in order to lead to similar performance gains on ImageNet classification. That is, we observed diminishing returns on downstream performance after 100k pretraining steps, and see similar gains when pretraining on ImageNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C ADDITIONAL RESULTS</head><p>We report detailed results corresponding to the figures presented in the paper. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> corresponds to <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> from the paper and shows transfer performance of different ViT models pre-trained on datasets of increasing size: ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>: Detailed results of model scaling experiments. These correspond to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> in the main paper. ResNets are typically trained with SGD and our use of Adam as optimizer is quite unconventional.</p><p>Here we show the experiments that motivated this choice. Namely, we compare the fine-tuning performance of two ResNets -50x1 and 152x2 -pre-trained on JFT with SGD and Adam. For SGD, we use the hyperparameters recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>. Results are presented   in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 7</ref>. Adam pre-training outperforms SGD pre-training on most datasets and on average. This justifies the choice of Adam as the optimizer used to pre-train ResNets on JFT. Note that the absolute numbers are lower than those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>, since we pre-train only for 7 epochs, not 30.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.2 TRANSFORMER SHAPE</head><p>We ran ablations on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture to find out which are best suited for scaling to very large models. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref> shows 5-shot performance on ImageNet for different configurations. All configurations are based on a ViT model with 8 layers, D = 1024, D M LP = 2048 and a patch size of 32, the intersection of all lines. We can see that scaling the depth results in the biggest improvements which are clearly visible up until 64 layers. However, diminishing returns are already visible after 16 layers. Interestingly, scaling the width of the network seems to result in the smallest changes. Decreasing the patch size and thus increasing the effective sequence length shows surprisingly robust improvements without introducing parameters. These findings suggest that compute might be a better predictor of performance than the number of parameters, and that scaling should emphasize depth over width if any. Overall, we find that scaling all dimensions proportionally results in robust improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.3 POSITIONAL EMBEDDING</head><p>We ran ablations on different ways of encoding spatial information using positional embedding. We tried the following cases:</p><p>• Providing no positional information: Considering the inputs as a bag of patches.</p><p>• 1-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a sequence of patches in the raster order (default across all other experiments in this paper).</p><p>• 2-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a grid of patches in two dimensions. In this case, two sets of embeddings are learned, each for one of the axes, X-embedding, and Y -embedding, each with size D/2. Then, based on the coordinate on   the path in the input, we concatenate the X and Y embedding to get the final positional embedding for that patch.</p><p>• Relative positional embeddings: Considering the relative distance between patches to encode the spatial information as instead of their absolute position. To do so, we use 1dimensional Relative Attention, in which we define the relative distance all possible pairs of patches. Thus, for every given pair (one as query, and the other as key/value in the attention mechanism), we have an offset p q − p k , where each offset is associated with an embedding. Then, we simply run extra attention, where we use the original query (the content of query), but use relative positional embeddings as keys. We then use the logits from the relative attention as a bias term and add it to the logits of the main attention (content-based attention) before applying the softmax.</p><p>In addition to different ways of encoding spatial information, we also tried different ways of incorporating this information in our model. For the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional positional embeddings, we tried three different cases: (1) add positional embeddings to the inputs right after the stem of them model and before feeding the inputs to the Transformer encoder (default across all other experiments in this paper); (2) learn and add positional embeddings to the inputs at the beginning of each layer; (3) add a learned positional embeddings to the inputs at the beginning of each layer (shared between layers). <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 8</ref> summarizes the results from this ablation study on a ViT-B/16 model. As we can see, while there is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and models with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding positional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level inputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less important. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original pixel-level inputs, e.g., 14 × 14 as opposed to 224 × 224, and learning to represent the spatial relations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies. Even so, the specific pattern of position embedding similarity learned by the network depends on the training hyperparameters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>).  <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: Size of attended area by head and network depth. Attention distance was computed for 128 example images by averaging the distance between the query pixel and all other pixels, weighted by the attention weight. Each dot shows the mean attention distance across images for one of 16 heads at one layer. Image width is 224 pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.4 EMPIRICAL COMPUTATIONAL COSTS</head><p>We are also interested in real-world speed of the architectures on our hardware, which is not always well predicted by theoretical FLOPs due to details like lane widths and cache sizes. For this purpose, we perform timing of inference speed for the main models of interest, on a TPUv3 accelerator; the difference between inference and backprop speed is a constant model-independent factor.</p><p>Figure 11 (left) shows how many images one core can handle per second, across various input sizes. Every single point refers to the peak performance measured across a wide range of batch-sizes. As can be seen, the theoretical bi-quadratic scaling of ViT with image size only barely starts happening for the largest models at the largest resolutions.</p><p>Another quantity of interest is the largest batch-size each model can fit onto a core, larger being better for scaling to large datasets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 11</ref> (right) shows this quantity for the same set of models. This shows that large ViT models have a clear advantage in terms of memory-efficiency over ResNet models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.5 AXIAL ATTENTION</head><p>Axial Attention <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ho et al., 2019</ref>) is a simple, yet effective technique to run selfattention on large inputs that are organized as multidimensional tensors. The general idea of axial attention is to perform multiple attention operations, each along a single axis of the input tensor, instead of applying 1-dimensional attention to the flattened version of the input. In axial attention, each attention mixes information along a particular axis, while keeping information along the other axes independent. Along this line, <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020b)</ref> proposed the AxialResNet model in which all the convolutions with kernel size 3 × 3 in a ResNet50 are replaced by axial self-attention, i.e. a row and column attention, augmented by relative positional encoding. We have implemented AxialResNet as a baseline model. 3 . Moreover, we have modified ViT to process inputs in the 2-dimensional shape, instead of a 1dimensional sequence of patches, and incorporate Axial Transformer blocks, in which instead of  a self-attention followed by an MLP, we have a a row-self-attention plus an MLP followed by a column-self-attention plus an MLP.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 12</ref>, present the performance of Axial ResNet, Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 on Ima-geNet 5shot linear, when pretrained on JFT dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of number of FLOPs and inference time (example per seconds). As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at the cost of more compute. This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global self-attention is replaced by two Axial Transformer blocks, one with row and one with column selfattention and although the sequence length that self-attention operates on is smaller in axial case, there is a extra MLP per Axial-ViT block. For the AxialResNet, although it looks reasonable in terms of accuracy/compute trade-off <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Figure 12, left)</ref>, the naive implementation is extremely slow on TPUs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Figure 12, right)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.6 ATTENTION DISTANCE</head><p>To understand how ViT uses self-attention to integrate information across the image, we analyzed the average distance spanned by attention weights at different layers ( <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). This "attention distance" is analogous to receptive field size in CNNs. Average attention distance is highly variable across heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others attend to small regions at or near the query location. As depth increases, attention distance increases for all heads. In the second half of the network, most heads attend widely across tokens.</p></div>

The larger model, ViT-H/14, further improves the performance, especially on the more challenging datasets -ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and the VTAB suite. Interestingly, this model still took substantially less compute to pre-train than prior state of the art. However, we note that pre-training efficiency may be affected not only by the architecture choice, but also other pa- rameters, such as training schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc. We provide a controlled study of performance vs. compute for different architectures in Section 4.4. Finally, the ViT-L/16 modelpre</note></figure>

In our experiments, we reproduced the scores reported in(Wang et al.,  2020b)  in terms of accuracy, however, our implementation, similar to the open-source implementation, is very slow on TPUs. Therefore, we were not able to use it for extensive large-scale experiments. These may be unlocked by a carefully optimized implementation.</note>
