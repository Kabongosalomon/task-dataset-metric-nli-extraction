<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Transformers are powerful for sequence modeling. Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index.

To verify this, we propose a segmentaware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segmentaware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Language modeling (LM) is a traditional sequence modeling task which requires learning long-distance dependencies for next token prediction based on the previous context. Recently, large neural LMs trained on a massive amount of text data have shown great potential for representation learning and transfer learning, and also achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baevski and Auli 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rae et al. 2020</ref>) and pre-trained language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Radford 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Devlin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yang et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lan et al. 2020</ref>) all use a multi-layer Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref>. The Transformer network was initially used in the seq2seq architecture for machine translation, whose input is usually a sentence. Hence, it is intuitive to distinguish each token with its position index in the input sequence. However, the input length can grow to 1024 or more tokens and come from different Copyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 1 https://github.com/rsvp-ai/segatron_aaai sentences and paragraphs for language modeling. Although vanilla position encoding can help the transformer be aware of the token position by assigning a unique index to each token, the token index in a sentence, sentence index in a paragraph, and paragraph index in a document are all implicit. Such segmentation information is essential for language modeling, as tokens in different segments of context hold different significance for next token prediction. If the Transformer model can be aware of the segment position of each context token, we hypothesize that better context representations will be encoded. This statement is not made lightly, as for 3000 years, many languages including ancient Latin, Greek, English, French, and Chinese did not have punctuations or paragraphs. The introduction of sentence and paragraph separators was fundamental, so is indexing them to train Transformers. Although punctuations and paragraph breakers can provide boundary information to some extent, the boundary is not as straightforward as segment position, especially for the dot-product self-attention based Transformer.</p><p>Hence, we propose a novel segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), which encodes paragraph index in a document, sentence index in a paragraph, and token index in a sentence all together for the input sequence. We first verify the proposed method with relative position encoding on the language modeling task. By applying the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL ), our base model trained with the WikiText-103 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Merity et al. 2017)</ref> outperforms Transformer-XL base by 1.5 points in terms of perplexity. Our large model achieves a perplexity of 17.1, the same score as Compressive Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rae et al. 2020)</ref>, which is a more complicated model with longer input context and additional training objectives. We also pre-train masked language models with Transformer (BERTbase) and Segatron (SegaBERT-base) with English Wikipedia for 500K training steps. According to experimental results, SegaBERT can outperform BERT on both general language understanding (GLUE) and machine reading comprehension (SQUAD and RACE) tasks. We further pre-trained a large model SegaBERT-large with the same data used in BERT. Experimental results show that SegaBERT-large can not only outperform BERT-large on all the above tasks, but also outperforms RoBERTa-large on zero-shot Semantic Textual Similarity tasks. These results demonstrate the value of segment encodings in Transformers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>In this section, we show how to apply our proposed segmentaware Transformer to language modeling. More specifically, we first introduce our Segatron-XL (Segment-aware Transformer-XL) with non-learnable relative position encoding for autoregressive language modeling. Then we introduce our pre-trained Segatron (SegaBERT) with learnable absolute position encoding for masked language modeling (MLM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Segatron-XL</head><p>We first introduce our method in the context of autoregressive language modeling, by replacing the vanilla Transformer index in Transformer-XL  with Segatron. Transformer-XL is a memory augmented Transformer with relative position encoding:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A rel i,j = E T xi W T q W k,E E xj + E T xi W T q W k,R R i−j +u T W k,E E xj + v T W k,R R i−j</formula><p>(1) where A rel i,j is the self-attention score between query i and key j. E xi and E xj are the input representations of query i and key j, respectively. R i−j is the relative position embedding. W k,E and W k,R are transformation matrices for input representation and position embedding, respectively. u and v are learnable variables. The position embeddings are non-learnable and defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R i−j,k = sin( i−j 10000 2k/dim ) k &lt; 1 2 dim cos( i−j 10000 2k/dim ) k ≥ 1 2 dim (2)</formula><p>where dim is the dimension size of R i−j , and k is the dimension index. Our proposed method introduces paragraph and sentence segmentation to the relative position encoding. The new position embeddings R I,J are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R I,J,k =      R t ti−tj ,k k &lt; 1 3 dim R s si−sj ,k− 1 3 dim 2 3 dim &gt; k ≥ 1 3 dim R p pi−pj ,k− 2 3 dim k ≥ 2 3 dim (3) where I = {t i , s i , p i }, J = {t j , s j , p j }. t,</formula><p>s, and p are token position index, sentence position index, and paragraph position index, respectively. R t , R s , and R p are the relative position embeddings of token, sentence, and paragraph. These embeddings are defined in Eq. 2 and the dimensions of each are equal to 1/3 of R I,J . The input representation of our model is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(a).</p><p>To equip the recurrence memory mechanism of Transformer-XL with the segment-aware relative position encoding, the paragraph position, the sentence position, and the token position indexes of the previous segment should also be cached together with the hidden states. Then, the relative position can be calculated by subtracting the cached position indexes from the current position indexes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-trained Segatron</head><p>We will introduce how to pre-train a language model with our proposed Segatron in this section.  First, pre-training a masked language model in the setting of BERT is a practical choice, as BERT is a popular baseline model and requires less computational resources compared with more recent large models. For example, BERT-large only needs about 10% of the resources of RoBERTa-large . Hence, in this paper, we first pre-train two base size models: SegaBERT-base − and BERT-base − with only English Wikipedia data for 500K training steps, to compare BERT pre-trained with Transformer and Segatron fairly. We then pre-train a large size model SegaBERT-large with Wikibooks dataset and 1M training steps, same as BERT-large. Input Representation. Input X of SegaBERT is a sequence of tokens, which can be one or more sentences or paragraphs. The representation x t for token t is computed by summing the corresponding token embedding E t , token index embedding P t t , sentence index embedding P s t , and paragraph index embedding P p t , as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b). Two special tokens [CLS] and [SEP] are added to the text sequence before the first token and after the last token, and their paragraph/sentence indexes are the same as their adjacent tokens. Following BERT, the text is tokenized into subwords with WordPiece and the maximum sequence length is 512. Training Objective. Following BERT, we use the masked LM as our training objective. However, next sentence prediction (NSP) is not used in our model, as our input contains more than two sentences. Data preparation. For the pre-training corpus we use English Wikipedia and Bookcorpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zhu et al. 2015)</ref>. For each document, we firstly split each into N p paragraphs, and all the sub-tokens in the i-th paragraph are assigned the same Paragraph Index Embedding P p i . The paragraph index starts from 0 for each document. Similarly, each paragraph is further segmented into N s sentences with NLTK (Bird, Klein, and Loper 2009), and all the sub-tokens in the i-th sentence are assigned the same Sentence Index Embedding P s i . The sentence index starts from 0 for each paragraph. Within each sentence, all the sub-tokens are indexed from 0; the i-th subtoken will have its Token Index Embedding P t i . When building a training example, we randomly (length weighted) sample a document from the corpus and randomly select a sentence in that document as the start sentence. Then, the following sentences are added to that example until the example meets the maximum length limitation (512) or runs out of the selected document. If any position index in that example exceeds the maximum index, all such position indexes will be subtracted by one until they meet the maximum requirements. The maximum position index of paragraph, sentence, and token are 50, 100, and 256, respectively. Training Setup.  have shown that BERT pre-trained with document input (more than two sentences) without NSP performs better than the original BERT on some tasks. Hence, we not only pre-train a SegaBERT-large, but also pre-train two base models with the same setting for fair comparison. Similar to BERT, the base model is 12 layers, 768 hidden size, and 12 self-attention heads. The large model is 24 layers, 1024 hidden size, and 24 self-attention heads. For optimization, we use Adam with learning rate 1e-4, β 1 =0.9, β 2 =0.999, with learning rate warm-up over the first 1% of the total steps and with linear decay of the learning rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>In this section, we first conduct autoregressive language modeling experiments with our proposed Segatron and also conduct an ablation study with this task. Then, we show the results of pre-trained SegaBERT on general language understanding tasks, semantic textual similarity tasks, and machine reading comprehension tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autoregressive Language Modeling</head><p>Dataset WikiText-103 is a large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling. This dataset preserves both punctuations and paragraph line breakers, which are essential for our segmentation pre-processing. There are 103M tokens, 28K articles for training. The average length is 3.6K tokens per article.  Main Results Our results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. As we can see from this table, the improvement with the segment-aware mechanism is quite impressive: the perplexity decreases 1.5 points for the Transformer-XL base and decreases 1.2 for Transformer-XL large. We also observe that our large model achieves 18.3 PPL with only 172K training steps. We finally obtain a perplexity of 17.1 with our large model -comparable to prior state-of-the-art results of Compressive Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rae et al. 2020)</ref>, which is based on Transformer-XL but trained with longer input length and memory length (512) and a more complicated memory cache mechanism. It is worth noting that we do not list methods with additional training data or dynamic evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Krause et al. 2018)</ref> which continues training the model on the test set. We also note that there is a contemporaneous work RoutingTransformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Roy et al. 2020)</ref>, which modifies the self-attention to local and sparse attention with a clustering method. How-  Transformer-XL Segatron-XL ever, their implementations are not available. We believe our method is orthogonal to their work and can be introduced to their model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>We plot the valid perplexity of Segatron-XL base and Transformer-XL base during training in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. From this figure, we can see that the segment-aware model outperforms the base model all the time, and the gap between them becomes larger as training progresses. Segatron-XL at 10K steps approximately matches the performance of Transformer-XL at 20K steps. We then test the effectiveness of Segatron over different input lengths (25, 50, 100, and 150 input tokens) by comparing Transformer-XL and Segatron-XL base models. As we can see from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the improvements are consistent and significant. There is no evidence showing our method prefers shorter or longer input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ablation Study</head><p>We finally conduct an ablation study with Segatron-XL base, to investigate the contributions of the sentence position encoding and the paragraph position encoding, respectively. Experimental results are shown in  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-trained Masked Language Model</head><p>We first plot the valid losses of BERT-base − and SegaBERT-base − during pre-training in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. The overall trends between <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> are similar, which demonstrates that our proposed segment-aware method works on both auto-regressive language modeling and masked language modeling. We will detail our experiments with our pre-trained models in the following sections.</p><p>General Language Understanding The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark ) is a collection of resources for evaluating natural language understanding systems. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>, we evaluate our model over these tasks: linguistic acceptability CoLA (Warstadt, Singh, and Bowman 2019), sentiment SST-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Socher et al. 2013)</ref>, paraphrase MRPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dolan and Brockett 2005)</ref>, textual similarity STS-B <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cer et al. 2017)</ref>, question paraphrase QQP, textual entailment RTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bentivogli et al. 2009</ref>) and MNLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Williams, Nangia, and Bowman 2018)</ref>, and question entailment QNLI . We fine-tune every single task only on its in-domain data without two-stage transfer learning. On the GLUE benchmark, we conduct the fine-tuning experiments in the following manner: For single-sentence classification tasks, such as sentiment classification (SST-2), the sentence will be assigned Paragraph Index 0 and Sentence Index 0. For sentence pair classification tasks, such as question-answer entailment (QNLI), the first sentence will be assigned Paragraph Index 0 and Sentence Index 0 and the second sentence will be assigned Paragraph Index 1 and Sentence Index 0.</p><p>We conduct grid search with the GLUE dev set for small data tasks: CoLA, MRPC, RTE, SST-2, and STS-B. Our grid search space is as follows:    • Learning rate: 2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5;</p><p>• Number of epochs: 3-10.</p><p>For QQP, MNLI, and QNLI, we use the default hyperparameters: 3e-5 learning rate, 256 batch size, and 3 epochs. The other hyper-parameters are the same as in the Hugging-Face Transformers library. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We compare BERT and SegaBERT in a fair setting to decouple the effects of document-level inputs and the removal of NSP. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>, two base models are pre-trained by us and the only difference is the position encoding. We can see that our SegaBERT-base − outperforms BERT-base − on most tasks. We also notice that SegaBERT-base − is lower than BERT-base − by over 2.5 points on CoLA. However, this gap decreases to 0.1 on the test set, which is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>. This is because the size of CoLA is quite small and not as robust as other datasets. Improvements can also be observed easily when comparing SegaBERT-large with the best score of 3 BERT-large models.</p><p>These results demonstrate SegaBERT's effectiveness in general natural language understanding. The improvements on these sentence and sentence pair classification tasks show 2 https://github.com/huggingface/transformers that our segment-aware pre-trained model is better than vanilla Transformer on sentence-level tasks.</p><p>Sentence Representation Learning Since our SegaBERT has shown great potential on sentence-level tasks, in this section, we further investigate whether SegaBERT can generate better sentence representations. Following Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych 2019), we fine-tune SegaBERT in a siamese structure on the combination of SNLI <ref type="bibr">(Bowman et al. 2015)</ref> and MNLI datasets. The finetuned model is named S-SegaBERT. We then evaluate the zero-shot performance of S-SegaBERT and other baselines on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks using the Spearman's rank correlation between the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings and the gold labels.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>, the results of S-BERT-large and S-RoBERTalarge are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Reimers and Gurevych (2019)</ref>. The results of S-BERT-large* are re-implemented by us, which is similar to Sentence-BERT's results. We can see that our SegaBERT achieves the highest average scores on STS tasks, even outperforms RoBERTa, which uses much more training data, larger batch size, and dynamic masking. These results conform with our improvements on GLUE benchmarks, which indicate that a language model pre-trained with Segatron can learn better sentence representations (single sentence encoding) than the original Transformer.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 6</ref>: Evaluation results on SQUAD v1.1 and v2. Results of BERT-base and BERT-large are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>. Results of BERT-large wwm on SQUAD v1.1 are from BERT's github repository. There are no official results of BERT-large wwm on SQUAD v2 and here we report our fine-tuning results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reading Comprehension</head><p>We finally test our pre-trained model on machine reading comprehension tasks. For these tasks, the question is assigned Paragraph Index 0 and Sentence Index 0. For a context with n paragraphs, Paragraph Index 1 to n + 1 are assigned to them accordingly. Within each paragraph, the sentences are indexed from 0. We first fine-tune our SegaBERT model with SQUAD v1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rajpurkar et al. 2016)</ref> for 4 epochs with 128 batch size and 3e-5 learning rate. The fine-tuning setting of SQUAD v2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018)</ref> is the same as SQUAD v1.1. Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 6</ref>. As we can see from</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>Acc-Dev Acc-Test BERT-large 72.7 72.0 SegaBERT-large 74.5 73.8  We further test our models with RACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lai et al. 2017)</ref>, which is a large-scale reading comprehension dataset with more than 28,000 passages. RACE has significantly longer contexts than SQUAD. Our results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 7</ref>. The overall trend is similar to SQUAD.</p><p>Visualization We further visualize the self-attention scores of BERT-base − and SegaBERT-base − in different layers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the average attention scores across different attention heads. By comparing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5(d)</ref> with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(a), we find that SegaBERT can capture context according to the segmentation, for example, tokens tend to attend more to tokens in its paragraph than tokens in the other paragraphs. A similar trend can be observed at the sentence level but is more prominent in the shallow layers On the other hand, the BERT model seems to pay more attention to its neighbors: the attention weights of the elements around the main diagonal are larger than other positions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5(a)</ref>, and a band-like contour around the main diagonal can be observed in this figure.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(f) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(c), we can see the attention structure in the final layer is different from the shallow layers, and SegaBERT pays more attention to its context than BERT. We also notice that a fractal-like structure can be observed in the first 10 layers of SegaBERT, while the last two layers of SegaBERT have a striped structure.</p><p>These attention behaviors show that: in the shallow layers, our model is segment-aware while BERT is neighborhoodaware; in the top layers, both of these two models focus on some tokens across the article rather than local neighbors, but our model can capture more contextual tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>Language modeling is a traditional natural language processing task which requires capturing long-distance dependencies for predicting the next token based on the context.</p><p>Most of the recent advances in language modeling are based on the Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vaswani et al. 2017</ref>) decoder architecture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Rfou et al.

ALBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lan et al. 2020)</ref> then proposed to share parameters across layers of BERT and replaced NSP with sentence order prediction (SOP). According to their experiments, SOP is more challenging than NSP, and MLM together with other downstream tasks can benefit more from replacing NSP with SOP. Concurrently to AL-BERT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al. (2020)</ref> proposed two auxiliary objectives to provide additional structural information for BERT.</p><p>All these powerful pre-trained models encode input tokens with token position encoding, which was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref> to indicate the position index of the input tokens in the context of machine translation and constituency parsing. After that, Transformer has been extensively applied in machine translation and other sequence generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu and Lapata 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Roller et al. 2020</ref>). However, the input length of language modeling tasks are much longer than these tasks, and simply assigning 0-512 token position embeddings is not enough for LMs to learn the linguistic relationships among these tokens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bai et al. (2020)</ref> show that incorporating segmentation information with paragraph separating tokens can improve the LM generator (GPT2) in the context of story generation. However, compared with punctuation and paragraph breaker, segment position indexes are more straightforward for dot-product self-attention based Transformers. In this work, we try to encode segmentation information into the Transformer with the segment-aware position encoding approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a novel segment-aware Transformer that can encode richer positional information for language modeling. By applying our approach to Transformer-XL, we train a new language model, Segatron-XL, that achieves 17.1 test perplexity on WikiText-103. Additionally, we pretrained BERT with our SegaBERT approach and show that our model outperforms BERT on general language understanding, sentence representation learning, and machine reading comprehension tasks. Furthermore, our SegaBERT-large model outperforms RoBERTa-large on zero-shot STS tasks. These experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method works on both language models with relative position embeddings and pre-trained language models with absolute position embeddings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Input representation of Segatron-XL and SegaBERT.</figDesc></figure>

They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections. Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, only one survived the Pacific War.

Then she sailed to Kure in April for more extensive repairs. In September,Ḧatsukazeänd Desron 10 escorted the battleship from Kure to Truk. In late September and again in late October, Desron 10 escorted the main fleet from Truk to Eniwetok and back again, in response to American carrier airstrikes in the Central Pacific region.
