<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The feed-forward architectures of recently proposed deep super-resolution networks learn representations of low-resolution inputs, and the non-linear mapping from those to high-resolution output. However, this approach does not fully address the mutual dependencies of low-and high-resolution images. We propose Deep Back-Projection Networks (DBPN), that exploit iterative up-and downsampling layers, providing an error feedback mechanism for projection errors at each stage. We construct mutuallyconnected up-and down-sampling stages each of which represents different types of image degradation and highresolution components. We show that extending this idea to allow concatenation of features across up-and downsampling stages (Dense DBPN) allows us to reconstruct further improve super-resolution, yielding superior results and in particular establishing new state of the art results for large scaling factors such as 8× across multiple data sets.</p></div>

A currently typical approach is to construct an HR image by learning non-linear LR-to-HR mapping, implemented as a deep neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. These networks compute a sequence of feature maps from the LR image, culminating with one or more upsampling layers to increase resolution and finally construct the HR image. In contrast to this purely feed-forward approach, human visual system is believed to use a feedback connection to simply guide the task for the relevant results <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Perhaps hampered by lack of such feedback, the current SR networks with only feed-forward connections have difficulty in representing the LR to HR relation, especially for large scaling factors. On the other hand, feedback connections were used effectively by one of the early SR algorithms, the iterative back-projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It iteratively computes the reconstruction error then fuses it back to tune the HR image intensity. Although it has been proven to improve the image quality, the result still suffers from ringing effect and chessboard effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, this method is sensitive to choices of parameters such as the number of iterations and the blur operator, leading to variability in results.</p><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we construct an end-to-end trainable architecture based on the idea of iterative up-and downsampling: Deep Back-Projection Networks (DBPN). Our networks successfully perform large scaling factors, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Our work provides the following contributions: (1) Error feedback. We propose an iterative errorcorrecting feedback mechanism for SR, which calculates both up-and down-projection errors to guide the reconstruction for obtaining better results. Here, the projection errors are used to characterize or constraint the features in early layers. Detailed explanation can be seen in Section 3.</p><p>(2) Mutually connected up-and down-sampling stages. Feed-forward architectures, which is considered as a oneway mapping, only map rich representations of the input to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, VDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, DRRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) commonly uses the conventional interpolation, such as Bicubic, to upscale LR input images before entering the network. (b) Single upsampling (e.g., FSRCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, ESPCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) propagates the LR features, then construct the SR image at the last step. (c) Progressive upsampling uses a Laplacian pyramid network which gradually predicts SR images <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. (d) Iterative up and downsampling approach is proposed by our DBPN which exploit the mutually connected up-(blue box) and down-sampling (gold box) stages to obtain numerous HR features in different depths. the output space. This approach is unsuccessful to map LR and HR image, especially in large scaling factors, due to limited features available in the LR spaces. Therefore, our networks focus not only generating variants of the HR features using upsampling layers but also projecting it back to the LR spaces using downsampling layers. This connection is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 (d)</ref>, alternating between up-(blue box) and down-sampling (gold box) stages, which represent the mutual relation of LR and HR image.</p><p>(3) Deep concatenation. Our networks represent different types of image degradation and HR components. This ability enables the networks to reconstruct the HR image using deep concatenation of the HR feature maps from all of the up-sampling steps. Unlike other networks, our reconstruction directly utilizes different types of LR-to-HR features without propagating them through the sampling layers as shown by the red arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 (d)</ref>.</p><p>(4) Improvement with dense connection. We improve the accuracy of our network by densely connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> each upand down-sampling stage to encourage feature reuse.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Image super-resolution using deep networks</head><p>Deep Networks SR can be primarily divided into four types as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>(a) Predefined upsampling commonly uses interpolation as the upsampling operator to produce middle resolution (MR) image. This schema was firstly proposed by SR-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to learn MR-to-HR non-linear mapping with simple convolutional layers. Later, the improved networks exploited residual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> and recursive layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, this approach might produce new noise from the MR image.</p><p>(b) Single upsampling offers simple yet effective way to increase the spatial resolution. This approach was proposed by FSRCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and ESPCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. These methods have been proven effective to increase the spatial resolution and replace predefined operators. However, they fail to learn complicated mapping due to limited capacity of the networks. EDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the winner of NTIRE2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, belongs to this type. However, it requires a large number of filters in each layer and lengthy training time, around eight days as stated by the authors. These problems open the opportunities to propose lighter networks that can preserve HR components better.</p><p>(c) Progressive upsampling was recently proposed in LapSRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It progressively reconstructs the multiple SR images with different scales in one feed-forward network. For the sake of simplification, we can say that this network is the stacked of single upsampling networks which only relies on limited LR features. Due to this fact, LapSRN is outperformed even by our shallow networks especially for large scaling factors such as 8× in experimental results.</p><p>(d) Iterative up and downsampling is proposed by our networks. We focus on increasing the sampling rate of SR features in different depths and distribute the tasks to calculate the reconstruction error to each stage. This schema enables the networks to preserve the HR components by learning various up-and down-sampling operators while generating deeper features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Feedback networks</head><p>Rather than learning a non-linear mapping of inputto-target space in one step, the feedback networks compose the prediction process into multiple steps which al-low the model to have a self-correcting procedure. Feedback procedure has been implemented in various computing tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>In the context of human pose estimation, Carreira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed an iterative error feedback by iteratively estimating and applying a correction to the current estimation. PredNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is an unsupervised recurrent network to predictively code the future frames by recursively feeding the predictions back into the model. For image segmentation, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> learn implicit shape priors and use them to improve the prediction. However, to our knowledge, feedback procedures have not been implemented to SR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Adversarial training</head><p>Adversarial training, such as with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> has been applied to various image reconstruction problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref>]. For the SR task, Johnson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> introduced perceptual losses based on high-level features extracted from pre-trained networks. Ledig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed SRGAN which is considered as a single upsampling method. It proposed the natural image manifold that is able to create photo-realistic images by specifically formulating a loss function based on the euclidian distance between feature maps extracted from VGG19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and SRResNet.</p><p>Our networks can be extended with the adversarial loss as generator network. However, we optimize our network only using an objective function such as mean square root error (MSE). Therefore, instead of training DBPN with the adversarial loss, we can compare DBPN with SRResNet which is also optimized by MSE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Back-projection</head><p>Back-projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is well known as the efficient iterative procedure to minimize the reconstruction error. Previous studies have proven the effectivity of backprojection <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Originally, back-projection is designed for the case with multiple LR inputs. However, given only one LR input image, the updating procedure can be obtained by upsampling the LR image using multiple upsampling operators and calculate the reconstruction error iteratively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Timofte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> mentioned that backprojection can improve the quality of SR image. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> proposed a method to refine high-frequency texture details with an iterative projection process. However, the initialization which leads to an optimal solution remains unknown. Most of the previous studies involve constant and unlearnable predefined parameters such as blur operator and number of iteration.</p><p>To extend this algorithm, we develop an end-to-end trainable architecture which focuses to guide the SR task using mutually connected up-and down-sampling stages to learn non-linear relation of LR and HR image. The mu-tual relation between HR and LR image is constructed by creating iterative up and down-projection unit where the up-projection unit generates HR features, then the downprojection unit projects it back to the LR spaces as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 (d)</ref>. This schema enables the networks to preserve the HR components by learned various up-and downsampling operators and generates deeper features to construct numerous LR and HR features.</p></div>

This projection unit takes the previously computed LR feature map L t−1 as input, and maps it to an (intermediate) HR map H t 0 ; then it attempts to map it back to LR map L t 0 ("back-project"). The residual (difference) e l t between the observed LR map L t−1 and the reconstructed L t 0 is mapped to HR again, producing a new intermediate (residual) map H t 1 ; the final output of the unit, the HR map H t , is obtained by summing the two intermediate HR maps. This step is illustrated in the upper part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>The down-projection unit is defined very similarly, but now its job is to map its input HR map H t to the LR map L t as illustrated in the lower part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. scale down:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L t 0 = (H t * g t ) ↓ s , (6) scale up: H t 0 = (L t 0 * p t ) ↑ s , (7) residual: e h t = H t 0 − H t ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>scale residual down:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L t 1 = (e h t * g t ) ↓ s ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>output feature map: We organize projection units in a series of stages, alternating between H and L.

In other existing networks, the use of largesized filter is avoided because it slows down the convergence speed and might produce sub-optimal results. However, iterative utilization of our projection units enables the network to suppress this limitation and to perform better performance on large scaling factor even with shallow networks.</p></div>

Inspired by this we propose to improve DBPN, by introducing dense connections in the projection units called, yielding Dense DBPN (D-DBPN).</p><p>Unlike the original DenseNets, we avoid dropout and batch norm, which are not suitable for SR, because they remove the range flexibility of the features <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.

The learning rate is initialized to 1e − 4 for all layers and decrease by a factor of 10 for every 5 × 10 5 iterations for total 10 6 iterations. For optimization, we use Adam with momentum to 0.9 and weight decay to 1e−4. All experiments were conducted using Caffe, MATLAB R2017a on NVIDIA TITAN X GPUs.</p></div>

Starting from our shallow network, the S network gives the higher PSNR than VDSR, DRCN, and LapSRN. The S network uses only 12 convolutional layers with smaller number of filters than VDSR, DRCN, and LapSRN. At the best performance, S networks can achieve 31.59 dB which better 0.24 dB, 0.06 dB, 0.05 dB than VDSR, DRCN, and Lap-SRN, respectively.

On 4× enlargement, the dense network, D-DBPN-L, gains 0.13 dB and 0.05 dB higher than DBPN-L on the Set5 and Set14, respectively. On 8×, the gaps are even larger. The D-DBPN-L has 0.23 dB and 0.19 dB higher that DBPN-L on the Set5 and Set14, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison with the-state-of-the-arts</head><p>To confirm the ability of the proposed network, we performed several experiments and analysis. We compare our network with eight state-of-the-art SR algorithms: A+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, SRCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, FSRCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, VDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>,     <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, LapSRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and EDSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. We carry out extensive experiments using 5 datasets: Set5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Set14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, BSDS100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Urban100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and Manga109 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Each dataset has different characteristics. Set5, Set14 and BSDS100 consist of natural scenes; Urban100 contains urban scenes with details in different frequency bands; and Manga109 is a dataset of Japanese manga. Due to computation limit of Caffe, we have to divide each image in Urban100 and Manga109 into four parts and then calculate PSNR separately. Our final network, D-DBPN, uses conv(3, 256) then conv(1, 64) for the initial feature extraction and t = 7 for the back-projection stages. In the reconstruction, we use conv <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. RGB color channels are used for input and output image. It takes less than four days to train.</p><p>PSNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and structural similarity (SSIM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> were used to quantitatively evaluate the proposed method. Note that higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better quality. As used by existing networks, all measurements used only the luminance channel (Y). For SR by factor s, we crop s pixels near image boundary before evaluation as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Some of the existing networks such as SRCNN, FSRCNN, VDSR, and EDSR did not perform 8× enlargement. To this end, we retrained the existing networks by using author's code with the recommended parameters.</p><p>We show the quantitative results in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Our D-DBPN outperforms the existing methods by a large margin in all scales except EDSR. For the 2× and 4× enlargement, we have comparable PSNR with EDSR. However, the result of EDSR tends to generate stronger edge than the ground truth and lead to misleading information in several cases. The result of EDSR for eyelashes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> shows that it was interpreted as a stripe pattern. On the other hand, our result generates softer patterns which subjectively closer to the ground truth. On the butterfly image, EDSR separates the white pattern which shows that EDSR tends to construct regular pattern such ac circle and stripe, while D-DBPN constructs the same pattern as the ground truth. The previous statement is strengthened by the results from the Ur-ban100 dataset which consist of many regular patterns from buildings. In Urban100, EDSR has 0.54 dB higher than D-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DBPN.</head><p>Our network shows it's effectiveness in the 8× enlargement. The D-DBPN outperforms all of the existing methods by a large margin. Interesting results are shown on Manga109 dataset where D-DBPN obtains 25.50 dB which is 0.61 dB better than EDSR. While on the Urban100 dataset, D-DBPN achieves 23.25 which is only 0.13 dB better than EDSR. The results show that our networks perform better on fine-structures images such as manga characters, even though we do not use any animation images in the training.</p><p>The results of 8× enlargement are visually shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>. Qualitatively, D-DBPN is able to preserve the HR components better than other networks. It shows that our networks can extract not only features but also create contextual information from the LR input to generate HR components in the case of large scaling factors, such as 8× enlargement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed Deep Back-Projection Networks for Single Image Super-resolution. Unlike the previous methods which predict the SR image in a feed-forward manner, our proposed networks focus to directly increase the SR features using multiple up-and down-sampling stages and feed the error predictions on each depth in the networks to revise the sampling results, then, accumulates the self-correcting features from each upsampling stage to create SR image. We use error feedbacks from the up-and down-scaling steps to guide the network to achieve a better result. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed network compares to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our proposed network successfully outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on large scaling factors such as 8× enlargement.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Super-resolution result on 8× enlargement.
