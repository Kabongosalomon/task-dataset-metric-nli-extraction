<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Current graph neural network (GNN) architectures naively average or sum node embeddings into an aggregated graph representationpotentially losing structural or semantic information. We here introduce OT-GNN, a model that computes graph embeddings using parametric prototypes that highlight key facets of different graph aspects. Towards this goal, we are (to our knowledge) the first to successfully combine optimal transport (OT) with parametric graph models. Graph representations are obtained from Wasserstein distances between the set of GNN node embeddings and "prototype" point clouds as free parameters. We theoretically prove that, unlike traditional sum aggregation, our function class on point clouds satisfies a fundamental universal approximation theorem. Empirically, we address an inherent collapse optimization issue by proposing a noise contrastive regularizer to steer the model towards truly exploiting the optimal transport geometry. Finally, we consistently report better generalization performance on several molecular property prediction tasks, while exhibiting smoother graph representations. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recently, there has been considerable interest in developing learning algorithms for structured data such as graphs. For example, molecular property prediction has many applications in chemistry and drug discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vamathevan et al., 2019)</ref>. Historically, graphs were decomposed into features such as molecular fingerprints, or turned into non-parametric graph kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vishwanathan et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shervashidze et al., 2011)</ref>.

Specifically, while GNNs produce node embeddings for each atom in the molecule, these are typically aggregated via simple operations such as a sum or average, turning the molecule into a single vector prior to classification or regression. As a result, some of the information naturally extracted by node embeddings may be lost.</p><p>Departing from this simple aggregation step, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Togninalli et al., 2019)</ref> recently proposed a kernel function over graphs by directly comparing non-parametric node embeddings as point clouds through optimal transport (Wasserstein distance). Their non-parametric model yields better empirical performance over popular graph kernels, but this idea hasn't been extended to the more challenging parametric case where optimization difficulties have to be reconciled with the combinatorial aspects of optimal transport solvers. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Our OT-GNN prototype model computes graph embeddings from Wasserstein distances between (a) the set of GNN node embeddings and (b) prototype embedding sets. These distances are then used as the molecular representation (c) for supervised tasks, e.g. property prediction. We assume that a few prototypes, e.g. some functional groups, highlight key facets or structural features of graphs relevant to a particular downstream task at hand. We express graphs by relating them to these abstract prototypes represented as free point cloud parameters.</p><p>Motivated by these observations and drawing inspiration from prior work on prototype learning (section 6), we introduce a new class of GNNs where the key representational step consists of comparing each input graph to a set of ab-arXiv:2006.04804v5 [stat.ML] 13 Feb 2021 stract prototypes ( <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref>). These prototypes play the role of basis functions; they are stored as point clouds as if they were encoded from actual real graphs. Each input graph is first encoded into a set of node embeddings using any existing GNN architecture. We then compare this resulting embedding point cloud to the prototype embedding sets. Formally, the distance between two point clouds is measured by their optimal transport Wasserstein distances. The prototypes as abstract basis functions can be understood as keys that highlight property values associated with different graph structural features. In contrast to previous kernel methods, the prototypes are learned together with the GNN parameters in an end-to-end manner.</p><p>Our notion of prototypes is inspired from the vast prior work on prototype learning which we highlight in section 6. In our case, prototypes are not required to be the mean of a cluster of data, but instead they are entities living in the data embedding space that capture helpful information for the task under consideration. The closest analogy are the centers of radial basis function networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Poggio &amp; Girosi, 1990</ref>), but we also inspire from learning vector quantization approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kohonen, 1995)</ref> and prototypical networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Snell et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Our model improves upon traditional aggregation by explicitly tapping into the full set of node embeddings without collapsing them first to a single vector. We theoretically prove that, unlike standard GNN aggregation, our model defines a class of set functions that is a universal approximator.</p><p>Introducing prototype points clouds as free parameters trained using combinatorial optimal transport solvers creates a challenging optimization problem. Indeed, as the models are trained end-to-end, the primary signal is initially available only in aggregate form. If trained as is, the prototypes often collapse to single points, reducing the Wasserstein distance between point clouds to Euclidean comparisons of their means. To counter this effect, we introduce a contrastive regularizer which effectively prevents the model from collapsing (section 3.2). We demonstrate its merits empirically.</p><p>Our contributions. First, we introduce an efficiently trainable class of graph neural networks enhanced with optimal transport (OT) primitives for computing graph representations based on relations with abstract prototypes. Second, we are the first to successfully train parametric graph models together with combinatorial OT distances, despite optimization difficulties. A key element is our noise contrastive regularizer that prevents the model from collapsing back to standard summation, thus fully exploiting the OT geometry. Third, we provide a theoretical justification of the increased representational power compared to the standard GNN aggregation method. Finally, our model shows consistent empirical improvements over previous state-of-the-art on molecular datasets, yielding also smoother graph embedding spaces.</p></div>

Let a point cloud X = {x i } n i=1 of size n be a set of n points x i ∈ R d . Given point clouds X, Y of respective sizes n, m, a transport plan (or coupling) is a matrix T of size n × m with entries in [0, 1], satisfying the two following marginal constraints: T1 m = 1 n 1 n and T T 1 n = 1 m 1 m .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Architecture Enhancement</head><p>Reformulating standard architectures. As mentioned in section 2.1, the final graph embedding h = v∈V h v obtained by aggregating node embeddings is usually fed to a MLP performing a matrix-multiplication whose i-th component is (Rh) i = r i , h , where r i is the i-th row of matrix R. Replacing ·, · by a distance/kernel k(·, ·) allows the processing of more general graph representations than just vectors in R d , such as point clouds or adjacency tensors.</p><p>From a single point to a point cloud. We propose to replace the aggregated graph embedding h = v∈V h v by the point cloud (of unaggregated node embeddings) H = {h v } v∈V , and the inner-products h, r i by the below written Wasserstein discrepancy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">W(H, Q i ) := min T∈C HQ i vj T vj c(h v , q j i ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Q i = {q j i } j∈{1,...,N } , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , M } represent M prototype point clouds each being represented as a set of N embeddings as free trainable parameters, and the cost is chosen as c = · − · 2 2 or c = − ·, · . Note that both options yield identical optimal transport plans.</p><p>Greater representational power. We formulate mathematically in section 4 that this kernel has a strictly greater representational power than the kernel corresponding to standard inner-product on top of a sum aggregation, to distinguish between different point clouds.</p><p>Final architecture. Finally, the vector of all Wasserstein distances in eq. (4) becomes the input to a final MLP with a single scalar as output. This can then be used as the prediction for various downstream tasks. This model is depicted in <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref> and motivated theoretically in section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Contrastive Regularization</head><p>What would happen to W(H, Q i ) if all points q j i belonging to point cloud Q i would collapse to the same point q i ? All transport plans would yield the same cost, giving for c = − ·, · :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">W(H, Q i ) = − vj T vj h v , q j i = − h, q i /|V | . (5)</formula><p>In this scenario, our proposition would simply overparametrize the standard Euclidean model.</p><p>A first obstacle and its cause. Our first empirical trials with OT-enhanced GNNs showed that a model trained with only the Wasserstein component would sometimes perform similarly to the Euclidean baseline in both train and validation settings, in spite of its greater representational power.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the Wasserstein model would naturally displace the points in each of its prototype point clouds in such a way that the optimal transport plan T obtained by maximizing vj T vj h v , q j i was not discriminative, i.e. many other transports would yield a similar Wasserstein cost. Indeed, as shown in eq. (5), if each point cloud collapses to its mean, then the Wasserstein geometry collaspses to Euclidean geometry. In this scenario, any transport plan yields the same Wasserstein cost. However, partial or local collapses are also possible and would still result in non-discriminative transport plans, also being undesirable. Further explanations are in appendix A.1 and <ref type="figure">fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>Contrastive regularization. To address this difficulty, we add a regularizer which encourages the model to displace its prototype point clouds such that the optimal transport plans would be discriminative against chosen contrastive transport plans. Namely, consider a point cloud Y of node embeddings and let T i be an optimal transport plan obtained in the computation of W(Y, Q i ). For each T i , we then build a set N eg(T i ) ⊂ C YQi of noisy/contrastive transports. If we denote by W T (X, Y) := kl T kl c(x k , y l ) the Wasserstein cost obtained for the particular transport T, then our contrastive regularization consists in maximizing the term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i log e −W T i (Y,Qi) e −W T i (Y,Qi) + T∈N eg(T i ) e −W T (Y,Qi) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>which can be interpreted as the log-likelihood that the correct transport T i be (as it should) a better minimizer of (a) No contrastive regularization (b) Using contrastive regularization (weight 0.1) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. 2D embeddings of prototypes and of a real molecule sample with and without contrastive regularization for runs using the same random seed trained on the ESOL dataset.

The selection of negative examples should reflect the trade-off: (i) not be too large, for computational efficiency while (ii) containing sufficiently meaningful and challenging contrastive samples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Optimization &amp; Complexity</head><p>Backpropagating gradients through optimal transport (OT) has been the subject of recent research investigations: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Genevay et al., 2017)</ref> explain how to unroll and differentiate through the Sinkhorn procedure solving OT, which was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schmitz et al., 2018)</ref> to Wasserstein barycenters. However, more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Xu, 2019)</ref> proposed to simply invoke the envelop theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afriat, 1971)</ref> to support the idea of keeping the optimal transport plan fixed during the backpropagation of gradients through Wasserstein distances. For the sake of simplicity and training stability, we resort to the latter procedure: keeping T fixed during back-propagation. We discuss complexity in appendix C. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> where σ(·) is the sigmoid function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Theoretical Analysis</head><p>In this section we show that the standard architecture lacks a fundamental property of universal approximation of functions defined on point clouds, and that our proposed architecture recovers this property.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Universality</head><p>As seen in section 3.1, we have replaced the sum aggregation − followed by the Euclidean inner-product − by Wasserstein discrepancies. How does this affect the function class and representations?</p><p>A common framework used to analyze the geometry inherited from similarities and discrepancies is that of kernel theory. A kernel k on a set X is a symmetric function k : X × X → R, which can either measure similarities or discrepancies. An important property of a given kernel on a space X is whether simple functions defined on top of this kernel can approximate any continuous function on the same space. This is called universality: a crucial property to regress unknown target functions.</p><p>Universal kernels. A kernel k defined on X n d is said to be universal if the following holds: for any compact subset X ⊂ X n d , the set of functions in the form 3 m j=1 α j σ(k(·, θ j ) + β j ) is dense in the set C(X ) of continuous functions from X to R, w.r.t the sup norm · ∞,X , σ denoting the sigmoid. Although the notion of universality does not indicate how easy it is in practice to learn the correct function, it at least guarantees the absence of a fundamental bottleneck of the model using this kernel.</p><p>In the following we compare the aggregating kernel agg(X, Y) := i x i , j y j (used by popular GNN models) with the Wasserstein kernel, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">W L2 (X, Y) := min T∈C XY ij T ij x i − y j 2 2 (7) W dot (X, Y) := max T∈C XY ij T ij x i , y j .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Theorem 1. We have that:</p><p>1. The aggregation kernel agg is not universal.</p><p>2. The Wasserstein kernel W L2 is universal.</p><p>Proof: See appendix B.1. Universality of the W L2 kernel comes from the fact that its square-root defines a metric, and from the axiom of separation of distances: if d(x, y) = 0 then x = y.</p><p>Implications. Theorem 1 states that our proposed OT-GNN model is strictly more powerful than GNN models that use summation or averaging of node embeddings. Nevertheless, this implies we can only distinguish graphs that have distinct multi-sets of node embeddings, e.g. all Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishable graphs in the case of graph convolutional networks.</p><p>In practice, the shape of the aforementioned functions having universal approximation capabilities gives an indication of how one should leverage the vector of Wasserstein distances to prototypes to perform graph classification -e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on top like we do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Definiteness</head><p>For the sake of simplified mathematical analysis, similarity kernels are often required to be positive definite (p.d.), which corresponds to discrepancy kernels being conditionally negative definite (c.n.d.). Although such a property has the benefit of yielding the mathematical framework of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, it essentially implies linearity, i.e. the possibility to embed the geometry defined by that kernel in a linear vector space.</p><p>We now discuss that, interestingly, the Wasserstein kernel we used does not satisfy this property, and hence constitutes an interesting instance of a universal, non p.d. kernel. Let us remind these notions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Kernel definiteness. A kernel k is positive definite (p.d.) on X if for n ∈ N * , x 1 , ..., x n ∈ X and c 1 , ..., c n ∈ R, we have ij c i c j k(x i , x j ) ≥ 0. It is conditionally neg- ative definite (c.n.d.) on X if for n ∈ N * , x 1 , ..., x n ∈ X and c 1 , ..., c n ∈ R such that i c i = 0, we have ij c i c j k(x i , x j ) ≤ 0.</formula><p>These two notions relate to each other via the below result <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boughorbel et al., 2005)</ref>: Proposition 1. Let k be a symmetric kernel on X , let x 0 ∈ X and define the kernel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">k(x, y) := − 1 2 [k(x, y) − k(x, x 0 ) − k(y, x 0 ) + k(x 0 , x 0 )].</formula><p>(9) Thenk is p.d. if and only if k is c.n.d.

However, the Wasserstein kernel is not p.d., as stated in different variants before (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vert, 2008)</ref>) and as reminded by the below theorem. We here give a novel proof in appendix B.2. Theorem 2. We have that:</p><p>1. The (similarity) Wasserstein kernel W dot is not positive definite;</p><p>2.

These datasets cover different complex chemical properties (e.g. ESOL -water solubility, LIPO -octanol/water distribution coefficient, BACE -inhibition of human βsecretase, BBBP -blood-brain barrier penetration).</p><p>We provide results for our implementation of 4 different widely used graph-based models.</p><p>Fingerprint + MLP applies a MLP over the input features which are hashed graph structures (called a molecular fingerprint).

Next, GAT is the Graph Attention Network from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Veličković et al., 2017)</ref>, which uses multihead attention layers to propagate information. The original GAT model does not account for edge features, so we adapt their algorithm to our setting. More details about our implementation of the GIN and GAT models can be found in the appendix D.2. Finally, Chemprop -D-MPNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yang et al., 2019</ref>) is a graph network that exhibits state-of-the-art performance for molecular representation learning across multiple classification and regression datasets. Empirically we find that this baseline is indeed the best performing, and so is used as to obtain node embeddings in all our prototype models.

ProtoS-L2 is a special case of ProtoW-L2, in which the point clouds have a single point and instead of using Wasserstein distances, we just compute simple Euclidean distances between the aggregated graph embedding and point clouds. Here, we omit using dot product distances, as that model is mathematically equivalent to the GNN model.</p><p>We use the the POT library <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Flamary &amp; Courty, 2017)</ref> to compute Wasserstein distances using the network simplex algorithm (Earth Movers distance), which we find empirically to be faster than the Sinkhorn algorithm for our datasets. We define the cost matrix by taking the pairwise L2 or negative dot product distances. As mentioned in section 3.3, we fix the transport plan, and only backpropagate through the cost matrix for computational efficiency. Additionally, to account for the variable size of each input graph, we multiply the OT distance between two point clouds by their respective sizes. To avoid the problem of point clouds collapsing, we employ the regularizer defined in section 3.2. More details about experimental setup are presented in appendix D.1.</p></div>

Our Proto-W-L2 model yields smoother heatmaps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4.">ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS</head><p>Model Sizes Using MPNN hidden dimension as 200, and the final output MLP hidden dimension as 100, the number of parameters for the models are given by table 4. The fingerprint used dimension was 2048, explaining why the MLP has a large number of parameters. The D-MPNN model is much smaller than GIN and GAT models because it shares parameters between layers, unlike the others. Our prototype models are even smaller than the D-MPNN model because we do not require the large MLP at the end, instead we compute distances to a few small prototypes (small number of overall parameters used for these point clouds). The dimensions of the prototype embeddings are also smaller compared to the node embedding dimensions of the D-MPNN and other baselines. We did not see significant improvements in quality by increasing any hyperparameter value.</p><p>Remarkably, our model outperforms all the baselines using between 10 to 1.5 times less parameters.</p><p>Runtimes. We report the average total training time (number of epochs might vary depending on the early stopping criteria), as well as average training epoch time for the D-MPNN and our prototype models in table 3. We note that our method is between 1 to 7.1 times slower than the D-MPNN baseline which mostly happens due to the frequent calls to the Earth Mover Distance OT solver.</p><p>Prototype interpretability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We propose OT-GNN: one of the first parametric graph models that leverages optimal transport to learn graph representations. It learns abstract prototypes as free parametric point clouds that highlight different aspects of the graph. Empirically, we outperform popular baselines in different molecular property prediction tasks, while the learned representations also exhibit stronger correlation with the target labels. Finally, universal approximation theoretical results enhance the merits of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Further Details on Contrastive Regularization</head><p>A.1. Motivation</p><p>One may speculate that it was locally easier for the model to extract valuable information if it would behave like the Euclidean component, preventing it from exploring other roads of the optimization landscape. To better understand this situation, consider the scenario in which a subset of points in a prototype point cloud "collapses", i.e. points become close to each other (see <ref type="figure">fig. 3</ref>), thus sharing similar distances to all the node embeddings of real input graphs. The submatrix of the optimal transport matrix corresponding to these collapsed points can be equally replaced by any other submatrix with the same marginals (i.e. same two vectors obtained by summing rows or columns), meaning that the optimal transport matrix is not discriminative. In general, we want to avoid any two rows or columns in the Wasserstein cost matrix being proportional.</p><p>An optimization difficulty. An additional problem of point collapsing is that it is a non-escaping situation when using gradient-based learning methods. The reason is that gradients of all these collapsed points would become and remain identical, thus nothing will encourage them to "separate" in the future.</p><p>Total versus local collapse. Total collapse of all points in a point cloud to its mean is not the only possible collapse case. We note that the collapses are, in practice, mostly local, i.e. some clusters of the point cloud collapse, not the entire point cloud. We argue that this is still a weakness compared to fully uncollapsed point clouds due to the resulting non-discriminative transport plans and due to optimization difficulties discussed above. Now let us look at the part of the proof that is new.</p><p>Lemma. σ is discriminatory w.r.t. W L2 .</p><p>Proof: Note that for any X, Y, θ, ϕ, when λ → +∞</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">we have that σ(λ(W L2 (X, Y) + θ) + ϕ) goes to 1 if W L2 (X, Y) + θ &gt; 0, to 0 if W L2 (X, Y) + θ &lt; 0 and to σ(ϕ) if W L2 (X, Y) + θ = 0. Denote by Π Y,θ := {X ∈ X | W L2 (X, Y) − θ = 0} and B Y,θ := {X ∈ X | W L2 (X, Y) &lt; θ} for θ ≥ 0</formula><p>and ∅ for θ &lt; 0. By the Lebesgue Bounded Convergence Theorem we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">0 = X∈X lim λ→+∞ σ(λ(W L2 (X, Y) − θ) + ϕ)dµ(X) = σ(ϕ)µ(Π Y,θ ) + µ(X \ B Y, √ θ ).</formula><p>Since this is true for any Combining the previous lemmas with k = W L2 concludes the proof.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ϕ, it implies that µ(Π Y,θ ) = µ(X \ B Y, √ θ ) = 0. From µ(X ) = 0 (because B Y, √ θ = ∅ for θ &lt; 0), we also have µ(B Y,</formula><p>B.2. Proof of theorem 2 1. We build a counter example. We consider 4 point clouds of size n = 2 and dimension d = 2. First, define u i = ( i/2 , i%2) for i ∈ {0, ..., 3}. Then take X 1 = {u 0 , u 1 }, X 2 = {u 0 , u 2 }, X 3 = {u 0 , u 3 } and X 4 = {u 1 , u 2 }. On the one hand, if W(X i , X j ) = 0, then all vectors in the two point clouds are orthogonal, which can only happen for {i, j} = {1, 2}. On the other hand, if W(X i , X j ) = 1, then either i = j = 3 or i = j = 4. This yields the following Gram matrix (W(X i , X j )) 0≤i,j≤3 =     1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">   <label>(10)</label></formula><p>whose determinant is −1/16, which implies that this matrix has a negative eigenvalue.</p><p>2. This comes from proposition proposition 1. Choosing k = W L2 and x 0 = 0 to be the trivial point cloud made of n times the zero vector yieldsk = W dot . Sincek is not positive definite from the previous point of the theorem, k is not conditionally negative definite from proposition proposition 1.</p><p>B.3. Shape of the optimal transport plan for point clouds of same size</p><p>The below result describes the shape of optimal transport plans for point clouds of same size. For the sake of curiosity, we also illustrate in <ref type="figure">fig. 2</ref> the optimal transport for point clouds of different sizes. We note that non-square transports seem to remain relatively sparse as well. This is in line with our empirical observations.</p><p>Proposition 2. For X, Y ∈ X n,d there exists a rescaled permutation matrix 1 n (δ iσ(j) ) 1≤i,j≤n which is an optimal transport plan, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">W L2 (X, Y) = 1 n n j=1 x σ(j) − y j 2 2 (11) W dot (X, Y) = 1 n n j=1 x σ(j) , y j .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Proof. It is well known from Birkhoff's theorem that every squared doubly-stochastic matrix is a convex combination of permutation matrices. Since the Wasserstein cost for a given transport T is a linear function, it is also a convex/concave function, and hence it is maximized/minimized over the convex compact set of couplings at one of its extremal points, namely one of the rescaled permutations, yielding the desired result.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1. Setup of Experiments</head><p>Each dataset is split randomly 5 times into 80%:10%:10% train, validation and test sets. For each of the 5 splits, we run each model 5 times to reduce the variance in particular data splits (resulting in each model being run 25 times). We search hyperparameters described in table 5 for each split of the data, and then take the average performance over all the splits. The hyperparameters are separately searched for each data split, so that the model performance is based on a completely unseen test set, and that there is no data leakage across data splits. The models are trained for 150 epochs with early stopping if the validation error has not improved in 50 epochs and a batch size of 16. We train the models using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4. For the prototype models, we use different learning rates for the GNN and the point clouds (5e-4 and 5e-3 respectively), because empirically we find that the gradients are much smaller for the point clouds. The molecular datasets used for experiments here are small in size (varying from 1-4k data points), so this is a fair method of comparison, and is indeed what is done in other works on molecular property prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>

We start by reminding a lemma coming from the original paper on the universality of neural networks by Cybenko <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cybenko, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Lemma. If σ is discriminatory w.r.t. k then k is universal.</p><p>Proof: Let S be the subset of functions of the form m i=1 α i σ(k(·, Q i ) + θ i ) for any θ i ∈ R, Q i ∈ X n d and m ∈ N * and denote byS the closure 4 of S in C(X ). Assume by contradiction thatS = C(X ). By the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists a bounded linear functional L on C(X ) such that for all h ∈S, L(h) = 0 and such that there exists h ∈ C(X ) s.t. L(h ) = 0. By the Riesz representation theorem, this bounded linear functional is of the form:</p><p>for all Q ∈ X n d and θ ∈ R. Since σ is discriminatory w.r.t. k, this implies that µ = 0 and hence L ≡ 0, which is a contradiction with L(h ) = 0. HenceS = C(X ), i.e. S is dense in C(X ) and k is universal.</p></div>

Note that here we do attention across all of a node's neighbors as well as the node itself.</p><p>The updated node embeddings are as follows:</p><p>The final graph embedding is just a simple sum aggregation of the node representations on the last layer (h G = vi h K vi ). As with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Veličković et al., 2017)</ref>, we also extend this formulation to utilize multiple attention heads.</p></div>
