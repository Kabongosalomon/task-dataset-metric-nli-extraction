<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Text classification and clustering play an important role in many applications, e.g, document retrieval, web search, spam filtering. At the heart of these applications is machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or Kmeans. These algorithms typically require the text input to be represented as a fixed-length vector. Perhaps the most common fixed-length vector representation for texts is the bag-of-words or bag-of-n-grams <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Harris, 1954)</ref> due to its simplicity, efficiency and often surprising accuracy.</p><p>However, the bag-of-words (BOW) has many disadvan- tages. The word order is lost, and thus different sentences can have exactly the same representation, as long as the same words are used. Even though bag-of-n-grams considers the word order in short context, it suffers from data sparsity and high dimensionality. Bag-of-words and bagof-n-grams have very little sense about the semantics of the words or more formally the distances between the words. This means that words "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant despite the fact that semantically, "powerful" should be closer to "strong" than "Paris."</p><p>In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised framework that learns continuous distributed vector representations for pieces of texts. The texts can be of variable-length, ranging from sentences to documents. The name Paragraph Vector is to emphasize the fact that the method can be applied to variable-length pieces of texts, anything from a phrase or sentence to a large document.</p><p>In our model, the vector representation is trained to be useful for predicting words in a paragraph. More precisely, we concatenate the paragraph vector with several word vectors from a paragraph and predict the following word in the given context. Both word vectors and paragraph vectors are trained by the stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>. While paragraph vectors are unique among paragraphs, the word vectors are shared. At prediction time, the paragraph vectors are inferred by fixing the word vectors and training the new paragraph vector until convergence.</p><p>Our technique is inspired by the recent work in learning vector representations of words using neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bengio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collobert &amp; Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mnih &amp; Hinton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mikolov et al., 2013a;</ref>. In their formulation, each word is represented by a vector which is concatenated or averaged with other word vectors in a context, and the resulting vector is used to predict other words in the context. For example, the neural network language model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bengio et al., 2006)</ref> uses the concatenation of several previous word vectors to form the input of a neural network, and tries to predict the next word. The outcome is that after the model is trained, the word vectors are mapped into a vector space such that semantically similar words have similar vector representations (e.g., "strong" is close to "powerful").</p><p>Following these successful techniques, researchers have tried to extend the models to go beyond word level to achieve phrase-level or sentence-level representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mitchell &amp; Lapata, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zanzotto et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yessenalina &amp; Cardie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Grefenstette et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013c)</ref>. For instance, a simple approach is using a weighted average of all the words in the document. A more sophisticated approach is combining the word vectors in an order given by a parse tree of a sentence, using matrix-vector operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Socher et al., 2011b)</ref>. Both approaches have weaknesses. The first approach, weighted averaging of word vectors, loses the word order in the same way as the standard bag-of-words models do. The second approach, using a parse tree to combine word vectors, has been shown to work for only sentences because it relies on parsing.</p><p>Paragraph Vector is capable of constructing representations of input sequences of variable length. Unlike some of the previous approaches, it is general and applicable to texts of any length: sentences, paragraphs, and documents. It does not require task-specific tuning of the word weighting function nor does it rely on the parse trees. Further in the paper, we will present experiments on several benchmark datasets that demonstrate the advantages of Paragraph Vector. For example, on sentiment analysis task, we achieve new stateof-the-art results, better than complex methods, yielding a relative improvement of more than 16% in terms of error rate. On a text classification task, our method convincingly beats bag-of-words models, giving a relative improvement of about 30%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Learning Vector Representation of Words</head><p>This section introduces the concept of distributed vector representation of words. A well known framework for learning the word vectors is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The task is to predict a word given the other words in a context.</p><p>In this framework, every word is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in a matrix W . The column is indexed by position of the word in the vocabulary. The concatenation or sum of the vectors is then used as features for prediction of the next word in a sentence.</p><p>More formally, given a sequence of training words w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , ..., w T , the objective of the word vector model <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A framework for learning word vectors. Context of three words ("the," "cat," and "sat") is used to predict the fourth word ("on"). The input words are mapped to columns of the matrix W to predict the output word.</p><p>is to maximize the average log probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 T T −k t=k log p(w t |w t−k , ..., w t+k )</formula><p>The prediction task is typically done via a multiclass classifier, such as softmax. There, we have p(w t |w t−k , ..., w t+k ) = e yw t i e yi Each of y i is un-normalized log-probability for each output word i, computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y = b + U h(w t−k , ..., w t+k ; W )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where U, b are the softmax parameters. h is constructed by a concatenation or average of word vectors extracted from W .</p><p>In practice, hierarchical softmax <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Morin &amp; Bengio, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mnih &amp; Hinton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikolov et al., 2013c</ref>) is preferred to softmax for fast training. In our work, the structure of the hierarical softmax is a binary Huffman tree, where short codes are assigned to frequent words. This is a good speedup trick because common words are accessed quickly. This use of binary Huffman code for the hierarchy is the same with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mikolov et al., 2013c)</ref>.</p><p>The neural network based word vectors are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent where the gradient is obtained via backpropagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>. This type of models is commonly known as neural language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bengio et al., 2006)</ref>. A particular implementation of neural network based algorithm for training the word vectors is available at code.google.com/p/word2vec/ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mikolov et al., 2013a)</ref>.</p><p>After the training converges, words with similar meaning are mapped to a similar position in the vector space. For example, "powerful" and "strong" are close to each other, whereas "powerful" and "Paris" are more distant. The difference between word vectors also carry meaning. For example, the word vectors can be used to answer analogy questions using simple vector algebra: "King" -"man" + "woman" = "Queen" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mikolov et al., 2013d)</ref>. It is also possible to learn a linear matrix to translate words and phrases between languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mikolov et al., 2013b)</ref>.</p><p>These properties make word vectors attractive for many natural language processing tasks such as language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bengio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mikolov, 2012)</ref>, natural language understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Collobert &amp; Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhila et al., 2013)</ref>, statistical machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mikolov et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zou et al., 2013)</ref>, image understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Frome et al., 2013)</ref> and relational extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Socher et al., 2013a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Paragraph Vector: A distributed memory model</head><p>Our approach for learning paragraph vectors is inspired by the methods for learning the word vectors. The inspiration is that the word vectors are asked to contribute to a prediction task about the next word in the sentence. So despite the fact that the word vectors are initialized randomly, they can eventually capture semantics as an indirect result of the prediction task. We will use this idea in our paragraph vectors in a similar manner. The paragraph vectors are also asked to contribute to the prediction task of the next word given many contexts sampled from the paragraph.</p><p>In our Paragraph Vector framework (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), every paragraph is mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix D and every word is also mapped to a unique vector, represented by a column in matrix W . The paragraph vector and word vectors are averaged or concatenated to predict the next word in a context. In the experiments, we use concatenation as the method to combine the vectors.</p><p>More formally, the only change in this model compared to the word vector framework is in equation 1, where h is constructed from W and D.</p><p>The paragraph token can be thought of as another word. It acts as a memory that remembers what is missing from the current context -or the topic of the paragraph. For this reason, we often call this model the Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM).</p><p>The contexts are fixed-length and sampled from a sliding window over the paragraph. The paragraph vector is shared across all contexts generated from the same paragraph but not across paragraphs. The word vector matrix W , however, is shared across paragraphs. I.e., the vector for "powerful" is the same for all paragraphs.</p><p>The paragraph vectors and word vectors are trained using stochastic gradient descent and the gradient is obtained via backpropagation. At every step of stochastic gradient descent, one can sample a fixed-length context from a random paragraph, compute the error gradient from the network in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and use the gradient to update the parameters in our model.</p><p>At prediction time, one needs to perform an inference step to compute the paragraph vector for a new paragraph. This is also obtained by gradient descent. In this step, the parameters for the rest of the model, the word vectors W and the softmax weights, are fixed.</p><p>Suppose that there are N paragraphs in the corpus, M words in the vocabulary, and we want to learn paragraph vectors such that each paragraph is mapped to p dimensions and each word is mapped to q dimensions, then the model has the total of N × p + M × q parameters (excluding the softmax parameters). Even though the number of parameters can be large when N is large, the updates during training are typically sparse and thus efficient.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>; the only change is the additional paragraph token that is mapped to a vector via matrix D. In this model, the concatenation or average of this vector with a context of three words is used to predict the fourth word. The paragraph vector represents the missing information from the current context and can act as a memory of the topic of the paragraph.</p><p>After being trained, the paragraph vectors can be used as features for the paragraph (e.g., in lieu of or in addition to bag-of-words). We can feed these features directly to conventional machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines or K-means.</p><p>In summary, the algorithm itself has two key stages: 1) training to get word vectors W , softmax weights U, b and paragraph vectors D on already seen paragraphs; and 2) "the inference stage" to get paragraph vectors D for new paragraphs (never seen before) by adding more columns in D and gradient descending on D while holding W, U, b fixed. We use D to make a prediction about some particular labels using a standard classifier, e.g., logistic regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of paragraph vectors:</head><p>An important advantage of paragraph vectors is that they are learned from unlabeled data and thus can work well for tasks that do not have enough labeled data.</p><p>Paragraph vectors also address some of the key weaknesses of bag-of-words models. First, they inherit an important property of the word vectors: the semantics of the words. In this space, "powerful" is closer to "strong" than to "Paris." The second advantage of the paragraph vectors is that they take into consideration the word order, at least in a small context, in the same way that an n-gram model with a large n would do. This is important, because the n-gram model preserves a lot of information of the paragraph, including the word order. That said, our model is perhaps better than a bag-of-n-grams model because a bag of n-grams model would create a very high-dimensional representation that tends to generalize poorly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Paragraph Vector without word ordering: Distributed bag of words</head><p>The above method considers the concatenation of the paragraph vector with the word vectors to predict the next word in a text window. Another way is to ignore the context words in the input, but force the model to predict words randomly sampled from the paragraph in the output. In reality, what this means is that at each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, we sample a text window, then sample a random word from the text window and form a classification task given the Paragraph Vector. This technique is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. We name this version the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DBOW), as opposed to Distributed Memory version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DM) in previous section. In this version, the paragraph vector is trained to predict the words in a small window.</p><p>In addition to being conceptually simple, this model requires to store less data. We only need to store the softmax weights as opposed to both softmax weights and word vectors in the previous model. This model is also similar to the Skip-gram model in word vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mikolov et al., 2013c)</ref>.</p><p>In our experiments, each paragraph vector is a combination of two vectors: one learned by the standard paragraph vector with distributed memory (PV-DM) and one learned by the paragraph vector with distributed bag of words (PV-DBOW). PV-DM alone usually works well for most tasks (with state-of-art performances), but its combination with PV-DBOW is usually more consistent across many tasks that we try and therefore strongly recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiments</head><p>We perform experiments to better understand the behavior of the paragraph vectors. To achieve this, we benchmark Paragraph Vector on two text understanding problems that require fixed-length vector representations of paragraphs: sentiment analysis and information retrieval.</p><p>For sentiment analysis, we use two datasets: Stanford sentiment treebank dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref> and IMDB dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Maas et al., 2011)</ref>. Documents in these datasets differ significantly in lengths: We also test our method on an information retrieval task, where the goal is to decide if a document should be retrieved given a query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sentiment Analysis with the Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset</head><p>Dataset: This dataset was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pang &amp; Lee, 2005)</ref> and subsequently extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref> as a benchmark for sentiment analysis. It has 11855 sentences taken from the movie review site Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>The dataset consists of three sets: 8544 sentences for training, 2210 sentences for test and 1101 sentences for validation (or development).</p><p>Every sentence in the dataset has a label which goes from very negative to very positive in the scale from 0.0 to 1.0. The labels are generated by human annotators using Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p><p>The dataset comes with detailed labels for sentences, and subphrases in the same scale. To achieve this, Socher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref> used the Stanford Parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Klein &amp; Manning, 2003)</ref> to parse each sentence to subphrases. The subphrases were then labeled by human annotators in the same way as the sentences were labeled. In total, there are 239,232 labeled phrases in the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded at: http://nlp.Stanford.edu/sentiment/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tasks and Baselines:</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref>, the authors propose two ways of benchmarking. First, one could consider a 5-way fine-grained classification task where the labels are {Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive} or a 2-way coarse-grained classification task where the labels are {Negative, Positive}. The other axis of variation is in terms of whether we should label the entire sentence or all phrases in the sentence. In this work we only consider labeling the full sentences.</p><p>Socher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref> apply several methods to this dataset and find that their Recursive Neural Tensor Network works much better than bag-of-words model. It can be argued that this is because movie reviews are often short and compositionality plays an important role in deciding whether the review is positive or negative, as well as similarity between words does given the rather tiny size of the training set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental protocols:</head><p>We follow the experimental protocols as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref>. To make use of the available labeled data, in our model, each subphrase is treated as an independent sentence and we learn the representations for all the subphrases in the training set.</p><p>After learning the vector representations for training sentences and their subphrases, we feed them to a logistic regression to learn a predictor of the movie rating.</p><p>At test time, we freeze the vector representation for each word, and learn the representations for the sentences using gradient descent. Once the vector representations for the test sentences are learned, we feed them through the logistic regression to predict the movie rating.</p><p>In our experiments, we cross validate the window size using the validation set, and the optimal window size is 8. The vector presented to the classifier is a concatenation of two vectors, one from PV-DBOW and one from PV-DM. In PV-DBOW, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions. In PV-DM, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions for both words and paragraphs. To predict the 8-th word, we concatenate the paragraph vectors and 7 word vectors. Special characters such as ,.!? are treated as a normal word. If the paragraph has less than 9 words, we pre-pad with a special NULL word symbol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We report the error rates of different methods in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The first highlight for this <ref type="table">Table is</ref> that bag-ofwords or bag-of-n-grams models (NB, SVM, BiNB) perform poorly. Simply averaging the word vectors (in a bagof-words fashion) does not improve the results. This is because bag-of-words models do not consider how each sentence is composed (e.g., word ordering) and therefore fail to recognize many sophisticated linguistic phenomena, for instance sarcasm. The results also show that more advanced methods (such as Recursive Neural Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref>), which require parsing and take into account the compositionality, perform much better.</p><p>Our method performs better than all these baselines, e.g., recursive networks, despite the fact that it does not require parsing. On the coarse-grained classification task, our method has an absolute improvement of 2.4% in terms of error rates. This translates to 16% relative improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Beyond One Sentence: Sentiment Analysis with IMDB dataset</head><p>Some of the previous techniques only work on sentences, but not paragraphs/documents with several sentences. For instance, Recursive Neural Tensor Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013b)</ref> is based on the parsing over each sentence and it is unclear how to combine the representations over many sentences. Such techniques therefore are restricted to work on sentences but not paragraphs or documents.</p><p>Our method does not require parsing, thus it can produce a representation for a long document consisting of many sentences. This advantage makes our method more general than some of the other approaches. The following experiment on IMDB dataset demonstrates this advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset:</head><p>The IMDB dataset was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Maas et al. (Maas et al., 2011)</ref> as a benchmark for sentiment analysis. The dataset consists of 100,000 movie reviews taken from IMDB. One key aspect of this dataset is that each movie review has several sentences.</p><p>The 100,000 movie reviews are divided into three datasets: 25,000 labeled training instances, 25,000 labeled test instances and 50,000 unlabeled training instances. There are two types of labels: Positive and Negative. These labels are balanced in both the training and the test set. The dataset can be downloaded at http://ai.Stanford.edu/ amaas/data/sentiment/index.html</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental protocols:</head><p>We learn the word vectors and paragraph vectors using 75,000 training documents (25,000 labeled and 50,000 unlabeled instances). The paragraph vectors for the 25,000 labeled instances are then fed through a neural network with one hidden layer with 50 units and a logistic classifier to learn to predict the sentiment. 1</p><p>At test time, given a test sentence, we again freeze the rest of the network and learn the paragraph vectors for the test reviews by gradient descent. Once the vectors are learned, we feed them through the neural network to predict the sentiment of the reviews.</p><p>The hyperparameters of our paragraph vector model are selected in the same manner as in the previous task. In particular, we cross validate the window size, and the optimal window size is 10 words. The vector presented to the classifier is a concatenation of two vectors, one from PV-DBOW and one from PV-DM. In PV-DBOW, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions. In PV-DM, the learned vector representations have 400 dimensions for both words and documents. To predict the 10-th word, we concatenate the paragraph vectors and word vectors. Special characters such as ,.!? are treated as a normal word.</p><p>If the document has less than 9 words, we pre-pad with a special NULL word symbol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The results of Paragraph Vector and other baselines are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. As can be seen from the <ref type="table">Table,</ref> for long documents, bag-of-words models perform quite well and it is difficult to improve upon them using word vectors. The most significant improvement happened in 2012 in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Dahl et al., 2012)</ref> where they combine a Restricted Boltzmann Machines model with bag-ofwords. The combination of two models yields an improvement approximately 1.5% in terms of error rates.</p><p>Another significant improvement comes from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang &amp; Manning, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Information Retrieval with Paragraph Vectors</head><p>We turn our attention to an information retrieval task which requires fixed-length representations of paragraphs.</p><p>Here, we have a dataset of paragraphs in the first 10 results returned by a search engine given each of 1,000,000 most popular queries. Each of these paragraphs is also known as a "snippet" which summarizes the content of a web page and how a web page matches the query.</p><p>From such collection, we derive a new dataset to test vector representations of paragraphs. For each query, we create a triplet of paragraphs: the two paragraphs are results of the same query, whereas the third paragraph is a randomly sampled paragraph from the rest of the collection (returned as the result of a different query). Our goal is to identify which of the three paragraphs are results of the same query. To achieve this, we will use paragraph vectors and compute the distances the paragraphs. A better representation is one that achieves a small distance for pairs of paragraphs of the same query and a larg distance for pairs of paragraphs of different queries.</p><p>Here is a sample of three paragraphs, where the first paragraph should be closer to the second paragraph than the third paragraph:</p><p>• Paragraph 1: calls from ( 000 ) 000 -0000 . 3913 calls reported from this number . according to 4 reports the identity of this caller is american airlines .</p><p>• Paragraph 2: do you want to find out who called you from +1 000 -000 -0000 , +1 0000000000 or ( 000 ) 000 -0000 ? see reports and share information you have about this caller • Paragraph 3: allina health clinic patients for your convenience , you can pay your allina health clinic bill online . pay your clinic bill now , question and answers...</p><p>The triplets are split into three sets: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. Any method that requires learning will be trained on the training set, while its hyperparameters will be selected on the validation set.</p><p>We benchmark four methods to compute features for paragraphs: bag-of-words, bag-of-bigrams, averaging word vectors and Paragraph Vector. To improve bag-of-bigrams, we also learn a weighting matrix such that the distance between the first two paragraphs is minimized whereas the distance between the first and the third paragraph is maximized (the weighting factor between the two losses is a hyperparameter).</p><p>We record the number of times when each method produces smaller distance for the first two paragraphs than the first and the third paragraph. An error is made if a method does not produce that desirable distance metric on a triplet of paragraphs.</p><p>The results of Paragraph Vector and other baselines are reported in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. In this task, we find that TF-IDF weighting performs better than raw counts, and therefore we only report the results of methods with TF-IDF weighting.</p><p>The results show that Paragraph Vector works well and gives a 32% relative improvement in terms of error rate. The fact that the paragraph vector method significantly outperforms bag of words and bigrams suggests that our proposed method is useful for capturing the semantics of the input text. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The performance of Paragraph Vector and bag-of-words models on the information retrieval task. "Weighted Bag-ofbigrams" is the method where we learn a linear matrix W on TF-IDF bigram features that maximizes the distance between the first and the third paragraph and minimizes the distance between the first and the second paragraph.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Some further observations</head><p>We perform further experiments to understand various aspects of the models. Here's some observations</p><p>• PV-DM is consistently better than PV-DBOW. PV-DM alone can achieve results close to many results in this paper (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). For example, in IMDB, PV-DM only achieves 7.63%. The combination of PV-DM and PV-DBOW often work consistently better (7.42% in IMDB) and therefore recommended.</p><p>• Using concatenation in PV-DM is often better than sum. In IMDB, PV-DM with sum can only achieve 8.06%. Perhaps, this is because the model loses the ordering information.</p><p>• It's better to cross validate the window size. A good guess of window size in many applications is between 5 and 12. In IMDB, varying the window sizes between 5 and 12 causes the error rate to fluctuate 0.7%.</p><p>• Paragraph Vector can be expensive, but it can be done in parallel at test time. On average, our implementation takes 30 minutes to compute the paragraph vectors of the IMDB test set, using a 16 core machine (25,000 documents, each document on average has 230 words).</p></div>

Their methods typically require parsing and is shown to work for sentence-level representations. And it is not obvious how to extend their methods beyond single sentences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>We described Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns vector representations for variablelength pieces of texts such as sentences and documents. The vector representations are learned to predict the surrounding words in contexts sampled from the paragraph.</p><p>Our experiments on several text classification tasks such as Stanford Treebank and IMDB sentiment analysis datasets show that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The good performance demonstrates the merits of Paragraph Vector in capturing the semantics of paragraphs. In fact, paragraph vectors have the potential to overcome many weaknesses of bag-of-words models.</p><p>Although the focus of this work is to represent texts, our method can be applied to learn representations for sequential data. In non-text domains where parsing is not available, we expect Paragraph Vector to be a strong alternative to bag-of-words and bag-of-n-grams models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Proceedings of the 31 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Beijing, China, 2014.
