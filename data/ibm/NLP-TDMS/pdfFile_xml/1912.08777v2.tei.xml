<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new selfsupervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise summaries from input document(s). In contrast to extractive summarization which merely copies informative fragments from the input, abstractive summarization may generate novel words. A good abstractive summary covers principal information in the input and is linguistically fluent.</p><p>In abstractive summarization, sequence-to-sequence <ref type="bibr">(Sutskever et al., 2014)</ref> has become a dominant framework using encoder-decoder architectures based on RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chung et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> and more recently Transformers <ref type="bibr">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Most prior work on neural abstractive summarization relied on large-scale, high-quality datasets of supervised document-summary pairs <ref type="bibr">(Hermann et al., 2015)</ref> and achieved promising results <ref type="bibr">(Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">See et al., 2017)</ref>. In recent years, there has been increased interest in collecting new summarization datasets that have more abstractive summaries <ref type="bibr">(Narayan et al., 2018)</ref>, have longer documents, <ref type="bibr">(Cohan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019)</ref>, utilize multiple documents <ref type="bibr">(Fabbri et al., 2019)</ref>, and are sourced from diverse domains <ref type="bibr">(Grusky et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koupaee &amp; Wang, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kornilova &amp; Eidelman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang &amp; Tetreault, 2019)</ref>; arXiv:1912.08777v2 [cs.CL] 2 Jun 2020 however, there has been little work on systematic evaluation of models across these broad settings.</p><p>Contemporaneously, the adoption of Transformer models <ref type="bibr">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> pre-trained using self-supervised objectives on large text corpora <ref type="bibr">(Radford et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> have improved performance on many NLP tasks <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Recent work leveraging such pre-training for Transformerbased sequence-to-sequence models <ref type="bibr">(Dong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Song et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rothe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raffel et al., 2019)</ref> has extended the success to text generation, including abstractive summarization.</p><p>In this work, we study pre-training objectives specifically for abstractive text summarization and evaluate on 12 downstream datasets spanning news <ref type="bibr">(Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Narayan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grusky et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fabbri et al., 2019)</ref>, science <ref type="bibr">(Cohan et al., 2018)</ref>, short stories <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2019)</ref>, instructions <ref type="bibr">(Koupaee &amp; Wang, 2018)</ref>, emails <ref type="bibr">(Zhang &amp; Tetreault, 2019)</ref>, patents <ref type="bibr">(Sharma et al., 2019)</ref>, and legislative bills <ref type="bibr">(Kornilova &amp; Eidelman, 2019)</ref>. We find that masking whole sentences from a document and generating these gap-sentences from the rest of the document works well as a pre-training objective for downstream summarization tasks. In particular, choosing putatively important sentences outperforms lead or randomly selected ones. We hypothesize this objective is suitable for abstractive summarization as it closely resembles the downstream task, encouraging whole-document understanding and summary-like generation. We call this self-supervised objective Gap Sentences Generation (GSG). Using GSG to pre-train a Transformer encoder-decoder on large corpora of documents (Web and news articles) results in our method, Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive SUmmarization Sequence-to-sequence models, or PEGASUS.</p><p>With our best 568M parameter model trained on the recently introduced C4 (Raffel et al., 2019) corpus we equal or exceed state-of-the-art on the 12 summarization tasks we consider. We further push forward the state-of-the-art using a newly collected text corpus comprised of news-like articles we call HugeNews, including the highly competitive XSum and CNN/DailyMail summarization datasets.</p><p>Large-scale document-summary datasets are rare and in practice there is a mismatch between research datasets and real-world use-cases where collecting summaries is expensive; the most common setting is that of low-resource summarization. We simulate this setting and show that our model is able to adapt very quickly when fine-tuning with small numbers of supervised pairs, obtaining state-of-the-art results in 6 datasets with only 1000 examples.</p><p>Qualitatively we observed high quality outputs from our best models and validated this in human evaluation studies. We found that PEGASUS summaries are at least as good as reference summaries for the datasets we assessed -XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU -even at low-levels of supervision.</p><p>To summarize our contributions:</p><p>• We propose a new self-supervised pre-training objective for abstractive summarization, gap-sentences generation, and study strategies for selecting those sentences.</p><p>• We evaluate the proposed pre-training objective on a broad range of downstream summarization tasks, with careful ablations to choose the best model settings, which we use to train a 568M parameter PEGASUS model that surpasses or is on-par with the state-of-theart on all 12 downstream datasets considered.</p><p>• We show how good abstractive summarization performance can be achieved across broad domains with very little supervision by fine-tuning the PEGASUS model and surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on many tasks with as little as 1000 examples.</p><p>• We conducted human evaluation studies to validate our experimental design and demonstrate human-level summarization performance on XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU.</p><p>2 Related Work <ref type="bibr">Dai &amp; Le (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Ramachandran et al. (2017)</ref> used LM and autoencoder pre-training on in-domain data to improve performance of RNN sequence models. However, the combination of pre-training with much larger external text corpora (such as Wikipedia, books, or Web-pages) and Transformerbased sequence models has led to a dramatic improvement in performance when fine-tuned for both natural language understanding and text generation tasks <ref type="bibr">(Radford et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Devlin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rothe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Song et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019)</ref>. Most similar to our approach are Transformer encoder-decoder models pre-trained on some masked input pre-training objective.</p><p>MASS <ref type="bibr">(Song et al., 2019)</ref> proposed masked sequence-tosequence generation that reconstructs a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence. A single sentence fragment was randomly selected.</p><p>UniLM <ref type="bibr">(Dong et al., 2019)</ref> proposed jointly training on three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional (leftto-right and right-to-left), bidirectional (word-level mask, with next sentence prediction), and sequence-to-sequence (word-level mask) prediction.</p><p>T5 <ref type="bibr">(Raffel et al., 2019)</ref> generalized the text-to-text framework to a variety of NLP tasks and showed the advantage of scaling up model size (to 11 billion parameters) and pre-training corpus, introducing C4, a massive text corpus derived from Common Crawl, which we also use in some of our models. T5 was pre-trained with randomly corrupted text spans of varying mask ratios and sizes of spans.</p><p>BART <ref type="bibr">(Lewis et al., 2019)</ref> introduced a denoising autoencoder to pre-train sequence-to-sequence models. BART corrupted text with an arbitrary noising function and learned to reconstruct the original text. For generation tasks, the noising function was text infilling which used single mask tokens to mask random sampled spans of text.</p><p>In contrast to MASS, UniLM, BART and T5, the proposed PEGASUS masks multiple whole sentences rather than smaller continuous text spans. In our final objective we deterministically choose sentences based on importance, rather than randomly. As in T5, PEGASUS does not reconstruct full input sequences, and only generates the masked sentences as a single output sequence. In this work we focus entirely on downstream summarization (generative) tasks and do not evaluate on NLU classification tasks.</p><p>There has been some work on the low-resource, summarization setting using the CNN/DailyMail dataset. <ref type="bibr">Radford et al. (2018b)</ref> showed that a large Transformer language model pre-trained on Web text could generate summaries if prompted with "TL;DR", achieving a ROUGE-2 of 8.27 on CNN/DailyMail. <ref type="bibr">Khandelwal et al. (2019)</ref> pre-trained a Transformer language model on Wikipedia, and fine-tuned using 3000 examples, achieving 13.1 ROUGE-2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Pre-training Objectives</head><p>We propose a new pre-training objective, GSG, in this work, but for comparison, we also evaluate BERT's maskedlanguage model objective, in isolation and in conjunction with GSG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gap Sentences Generation (GSG)</head><p>We hypothesize that using a pre-training objective that more closely resembles the downstream task leads to better and faster fine-tuning performance. Given our intended use for abstractive summarization, our proposed pre-training objective involves generating summary-like text from an input document. In order to leverage massive text corpora for pretraining, we design a sequence-to-sequence self-supervised objective in the absence of abstactive summaries. A naive option would be to pre-train as an extractive summarizer; however, such a procedure would only train a model to copy sentences, thus not suitable for abstractive summarization.</p><p>Inspired by recent success in masking words and contiguous spans <ref type="bibr">(Joshi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raffel et al., 2019)</ref>, we select and mask whole sentences from documents, and concatenate the gap-sentences into a pseudo-summary. The corresponding position of each selected gap sentence is replaced by a mask token [MASK1] to inform the model. Gap sentences ratio, or GSR, refers to the number of selected gap sentences to the total number of sentences in the document, which is similar to mask rate in other works.</p><p>To even more closely approximate a summary, we select sentences that appear to be important/principal to the document. The resulting objective has both the empirically demonstrated benefits of masking, and anticipates the form of the downstream task.</p><p>We consider 3 primary strategies for selecting m gap sentences without replacement from a document, D = {x i } n , comprised of n sentences:</p><p>Random Uniformly select m sentences at random.</p><p>Lead Select the first m sentences.</p><p>Principal Select top-m scored sentences according to importance. As a proxy for importance we compute <ref type="bibr">ROUGE1-F1 (Lin, 2004)</ref> between the sentence and the rest of the document, s i = rouge(x i , D \ {x i }), ∀i.</p><p>In this formulation sentences are scored independently (Ind) and the top m selected. We also consider selecting them sequentially (Seq) as in <ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> by greedily maximizing the ROUGE1-F1 between selected sentences, S ∪ {x i }, and remaining sentences, D \ (S ∪ {x i }) as in Algorithm 1.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Sequential Sentence Selection 1: S := ∅ 2: for j ← 1 to m do 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s i := rouge S ∪ {x i }, D \ (S ∪ {x i }) ∀i s.t. x i / ∈ S 4:</formula><p>k := arg max i {s i } n 5:</p><p>S := S ∪ {x k } 6: end for When calculating ROUGE1-F1, we also consider n-grams as a set (Uniq) instead of double-counting identical n-grams as in the original implementation (Orig). This results in four variants of the principal sentence selection strategy, choosing Ind/Seq and Orig/Uniq options.</p><p>An example containing lead, random and principal gap sentence selection strategies are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. <ref type="bibr">INVITATION</ref> ONLY We are very excited to be co-hosting a major drinks reception with our friends at Progress.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Masked Language Model (MLM)</head><p>Following BERT, we select 15% tokens in the input text, and the selected tokens are (1) 80% of time replaced by a mask token [MASK2], or (2) 10% of time replaced by a random token, or (3) 10% of time unchanged. We apply MLM to train the Transformer encoder as the sole pre-training objective or along with GSG. When MLM is the sole pre-training objective, the Transformer decoder shares all parameters with encoder when fine-tuning on downstream tasks following <ref type="bibr">Rothe et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>Figure 1 simultaneously shows how both GSG and MLM are applied to the same example when used in conjunction. However, we found that MLM does not improve downstream tasks at large number of pre-training steps (section 6.1.2), and chose not to include MLM in the final model PEGASUS LARGE (section 6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Pre-training Corpus</head><p>For pre-training we considered two large text corpora:</p><p>• C4, or the Colossal and Cleaned version of Common Crawl, introduced in Raffel et al. <ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref>; consists of text from 350M Web-pages (750GB).</p><p>• HugeNews, a dataset of 1.5B articles (3.8TB) collected from news and news-like websites from 2013-2019.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>In a similar strategy to <ref type="bibr">Raffel et al. (2019)</ref>, to save time and computation we conducted pre-training ablation experiments using a reduced-size model with 223M parameters, PEGASUS BASE , smaller batch size, and only 4 of 12 datasets before scaling up pre-training with the best settings to the final 568M parameters, PEGASUS LARGE . The datasets (XSum, CNN/DailyMail, WikiHow and Reddit TIFU) were chosen for diversity in abstractiveness, writing style, and size.</p><p>PEGASUS BASE had L = 12, H = 768, F = 3072, A = 12 and PEGASUS LARGE had L = 16, H = 1024, F = 4096, A = 16, where L denotes the number of layers for encoder and decoder (i.e. Transformer blocks), H for the hidden size, F for the feed-forward layer size and A for the number of self-attention heads. We pre-trained PEGASUS BASE with a batch size of 256 and PEGASUS LARGE with a batch size of 8192. We refer to PEGASUS BASE without pre-training as Transformer BASE .</p><p>We used sinusoidal positional encoding following <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref>. For optimization, both pre-training and finetuning used Adafactor <ref type="bibr">(Shazeer &amp; Stern, 2018)</ref> with square root learning rate decay and dropout rate of 0.1.</p><p>We used greedy-decoding for studies in Section 6.1, and used beam-search with a length-penalty, α, as in <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. (2016)</ref> for the final large model.</p><p>All experiments' hyper parameters can be found in Appendix C and reported numbers are in Appendix D and E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Ablations on PEGASUS BASE</head><p>We used PEGASUS BASE to evaluate choices of pre-training corpus, pre-training objective, and vocabulary size. For reproducibility, we evaluated the latter two using the publicly available C4 corpus.</p><p>Note that the y-axis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 3, 4</ref>, 5 are normalized by the left-most bar using 1 3 ( R1 R1base + R2 R2base + RL RLbase ) where R1, R2, RL are ROUGE F1 scores and R1 base , R2 base , RL base are the scores of the configuration corresponding to the first bar.</p><p>With more pre-training steps, the model observed more documents in the pre-training corpus. A PEGASUS BASE model trained for 500k (highest we tried) steps did not observe all training examples on C4 nor HugeNews. Appendix B shows the number of pre-training steps had an unsurprisingly positive impact on downstream dataset performance. We used 500k steps for the ablation studies and the large model.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> shows that pre-training on HugeNews was more effective than C4 on the two news downstream datasets, while the non-news informal datasets (WikiHow and Reddit TIFU) prefer the pre-training on C4. This suggests pretraining models transfer more effectively to downstream tasks when their domains are aligned better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">EFFECT OF PRE-TRAINING OBJECTIVES</head><p>GSG We compared six variants of GSG (Lead, Random, Ind-Orig, Ind-Uniq, Seq-Orig, Seq-Uniq) while choosing 30% sentences as gap sentences. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4a</ref>, Ind-Orig achieved the best performance followed by Seq-Uniq. Ind-Orig and Seq-Uniq were consistently better (or similar) than Random and Lead across the four downstream datasets. Lead had decent performance on the two news datasets but was significantly worse on the two non-news datasets, which agrees findings of lead bias in news datasets <ref type="bibr">(See et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2019)</ref>. The results suggest choosing principal sentences works best for downstream summarization tasks, and we chose Ind-Orig for the PEGASUS LARGE .</p><p>A significant hyper-parameter in GSG is the gap-sentences ratio (GSR). A low GSR makes the pre-training less challenging and computationally efficient. On the other hand, choosing gap sentences at a high GSR loses contextual  information necessary to guide the generation. We compared GSRs from 15% to 75%. For a fair comparison, the original documents were truncated to have up to 400 words. The maximum input length, L input in the encoder and the maximum target length, L target in the decoder were set as 512 tokens. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4b</ref> shows that different downstream datasets had slightly different optima. The best performance always had GSR lower than 50%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Larger Model Results</head><p>Compared with PEGASUS BASE , the large model PEGASUS LARGE had increased capacity from larger hidden size (H : 768 → 1024, F : 3072 → 4096, A : 12 → 16), number of layers (L : 12 → 16) and traversed much more data, due to larger batch size (B : 256 → 8192) (same number of pre-training steps, 500k). We adopted the best practices found in the PEGASUS BASE ablation studies using the GSG (Ind-Orig) pre-training objective without MLM and Unigram vocabulary size of 96k.

While some previous work suggested that maximum likelihood training results in repetitive text in model outputs <ref type="bibr">(Welleck et al., 2019)</ref> we found this to be rare in our outputs and did not require additional countermeasures to mitigate dis-fluencies.</p><p>Although ROUGE clearly has its draw-backs <ref type="bibr">(Kryscinski et al., 2019)</ref>, over-penalizing abstractive approaches compared to extractive ones and having no sense of linguistic quality, we found that choosing perplexity-optimized models using aggregated ROUGE (rather than directly optimizing ROUGE as in Paulus et al. <ref type="formula">(2017)</ref>) resulted in qualitatively good models. Randomly sampled (by a program) model decodes across all datasets and a broad range of ROUGE scores can be found in Appendix H.We found that even low-ROUGE model summaries often were highquality, <ref type="figure">Figure G</ref>.1.</p><p>To assess how close PEGASUS LARGE is to human performance we conducted human evaluation experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk comparing model summaries with (human) reference summaries given the input document. The examples were drawn from the XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU datasets; the first two were chosen due to their popularity in past work, and the third was chosen for its significant difference in style. Workers were asked to rate the summaries on a 1-5 scale, with higher being better (full experiment details provided in Appendix F) and a paired t-test was used to assess whether scores were significantly different from human.</p><p>In the first experiment, PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews), PEGASUS LARGE (C4), and Transformer BASE were compared with reference summaries; in the second experiment, PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews) fine-tuned using 10, 100, 1000, and all supervised examples were compared with references; the results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>. According to the significance level of p &lt; 0.01, both PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews) and PEGASUS LARGE (C4) outputs were at least as good as the reference summaries in all cases. Even at low-levels of supervision PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews) was not measurably worse than human summaries on XSum and CNN/DailyMail. In the Reddit TIFU case, however, perhaps due to its diverse writing styles, human performance required full supervision.</p><p>In this work, we proposed PEGASUS, a sequence-tosequence model with gap-sentences generation as a pretraining objective tailored for abstractive text summarization. We studied several gap-sentence selection methods and identified principle sentence selection as the optimal strategy. We demonstrated the effects of the pre-training corpora, gap-sentences ratios, vocabulary sizes and scaled up the best configuration to achieve state-of-the-art results on all 12 diverse downstream datasets considered. We also showed that our model was able to adapt to unseen summarization datasets very quickly, achieving strong results in as little as 1000 examples. We finally showed our model summaries achieved human performance on multiple datasets using human evaluation.</p></div>

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists -including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were "misguided". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than 11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&amp;E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to "incentivise best quality practice" and "drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care". "Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them," said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the "full impact" of the incentive scheme and was "confident that there is no conflict of interest". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a "financial contaminant" to patient-doctor trust.

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: "Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. "The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage." Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work "could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction". But she cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans.</p></div>

The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a "distraction". Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes office next January.

Cotswold District Council's proposal to form a unity authority with West Oxfordshire has proved controversial. But CDC says the plans -dubbed 'Coxit' -are at an early stage but aim to improve accountability. CDC leader Lynden Stowe has said Gloucestershire's "historic borders" would remain under the proposals, which aim to improve the "administration and the delivery of council services". He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire a few weeks ago: "We would expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders, exactly as now, so if there's a crime in Cirencester, Gloucestershire Police attend and if there's a burglary in Burford, Thames Valley Police attend." But Gloucestershire's PCC Martin Surl said he had taken legal advice on the "Coxit" proposal, and warned it could "signal the end of Gloucestershire Police as we know it". Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, he said the Cotswolds could become part of Thames Valley Police District. "If they break away to a new district, we can't continue policing just half a district," he told the BBC. "So, either we start taking some of Thames Valley's area in Oxfordshire, or they start policing parts of Gloucestershire. Neither want that ." A spokesman for Cotswold District Council said they "fully understand the initial concerns" but they were "best addressed through the detailed studies that will now take place to assess the feasibility of the unitary proposal". Mr Surl, an independent, is standing for re-election as Gloucestershire PCC on 5 May, alongside Labour's Barry Kirby and the Conservatives' Will Windsor Clive.</p></div>

Poverty comes in many forms: a middle-aged man making $10 an hour, a single mother with mouths to feed, a person with a criminal record and few employers willing to look past it. But the path out is often the same: acquiring a new skill, whether its taking college classes or learning how to boost a lousy credit score. Within the next few years, nearly two-thirds of all job openings in the United States will require at least some sort of certification, according to Georgetown University research. But funding for career training has declined drastically. In Massachusetts, the state budget for programs that provide these services has been slashed in half in the past decade. Soon, however, lower-income residents may have more tools to lift themselves up. President Obama just launched an initiative to help workers upgrade skills, and last month, the White House held a summit with employers, nonprofits, tech innovators, and unions committed to expanding and improving educational opportunities for millions of workers. Its very, very, very difficult to move up without accumulating higher-level skills, said Jerry Rubin, chief executive of Jewish Vocational Service, a Boston nonprofit that provides worker training. Without them, people will be employed, but they will be at or below the poverty line. Many who have lifted themselves out of desperate situations say they could not have gotten there on their own or without a lot of effort. Here are a few of their stories. A study by a Boston nonprofit found that poor people often face high interest rates that make it nearly impossible to pay down debts.

Size really does seem to matter when it comes to cancer risk. Being tall undoubtedly has its benefits. You can see in a crowd and grab objects off high shelves. But with the good comes the bad. The taller you are, the higher your odds of developing cancer, and a new paper has added weight to this. key points Key points: Taller people have more cells in their body, as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow For every 10cm over the average height, a person's risk for cancer increases 10 per cent New analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this, and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height Leonard Nunney, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person's body, using height as a proxy, might affect their risk of developing cancer. Reporting in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall: For every 10 centimetres over the average height, the risk of developing any cancer increased by around 10 per cent. This fits with previous studies. "If you were comparing a 5-foot guy to a basketball player who's over 7 feet tall, then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board," Professor Nunney said. He also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma, and women specifically had greater odds of developing thyroid cancer. But it doesn't mean tall people should panic.

Consider this quote from lead researcher Leonard Nunney of the University of California Riverside: "If you were comparing a 5-foot guy to a basketball player who's over 7 feet tall, then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board," he tells Australia's ABC. Yes, Nunney's study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that taller people are at greater risk for cancer. The surprisingly simple reason? They have more cells, and thus more things go can wrong in those cells, explains the Guardian. Specifically, the study found that cancer risk rises by 10% for every 4 inches people are above average height5 feet 4 for women and 5 feet 9 for men, reports CNN. The findings held true for 18 of 23 cancers studied. "Now, you can't do anything about your height, but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this, and if they have any concerns, to get checked," says Nunney.

Their teeth contain DNA from the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis and their graves have been dated to 1348-50.

It's a hugely important step forward Jay Carver , Lead archaeologist, Crossrail Archaeologists now believe it is under Charterhouse Square near the Barbican. They plan to expand their search for victims across the square -guided by underground radar scans, which have picked up signs of many more graves. Crossrail's lead archaeologist Jay Carver says the find "solves a 660-year-old mystery". "This discovery is a hugely important step forward in documenting and understanding Europe's most devastating pandemic," he said. "Further excavations will follow to see if -as we expect -we are coming across a much bigger mass burial trench."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gold</head><p>Skeletons dug up in London last year are indeed the remains of people who died from the Black Plagueand who suffered a tough life before falling ill, the BBC reports. Forensic analysis shows that teeth taken from at least four of the 12 corpses discovered during excavation for a rail line contained trace amounts of plague DNA, indicating exposure. Early burials found at the site, from the late 1340s, are nice and orderly, with bodies wrapped in white shrouds, but skeletons from a second outbreak in the 1430s are tossed in with what appear to be upper-body injuriesevidence of "a period of lawlessness and social breakdown," Phys.org reports. Among other significant details: Several skeletons suffered from malnutrition and 16% had rickets. Many had back damage, signalling stressful manual labor. Analysis of one victim is amazingly detailed: He was born outside of London, breastfed, had bad tooth decay as a boy, and worked in manual labor before dying as a young man of the Black Death. Archaeologists suspect that thousands more Black Death victims lie nearby, and a dig is planned for this summer. DNA experts are analyzing the plague genome in victims' teeth in case there's more to learn about the disease, which still kills 2,000 people per year ( Model It's a "hugely important" find, one that could shed light on the Black Death, the plague that wiped out at least 60% of London's population between 1347 and 1351, the BBC reports. Archaeologists digging for railway tracks in London's Crossrail station uncovered 25 skeletons, along with pottery dated to the mid-14th century, that have DNA from the bacterium Yerinia pestis dated to 13 to 50 years old. That's a long way from the 660-year-old record showing that thousands of Londoners died from the plague and their bodies were dumped in a mass grave outside the City of London. "We can start to answer questions like: where did they come from and what were their lives about?" says Crossrail archaeologist Jay Carver. "I'm amazed of the reasons for why the Black Death was so devastating." DNA from 12 of the skeletons has confirmed that they had contact with the plague prior to their death, and researchers plan more excavations to see if they're coming across a much bigger plague trench. "We can see that Londoners weren't living an easy life," Carver says, "and that's possibly one of the explanations for why the Black Death was so devastating."

An earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018 to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken. When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Islandnear the larger Baffin Islandin the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed. Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen. "We stood there cryingfilming with tears rolling down our cheeks," he said. Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didnt intervene. "Of course, that crossed my mind," said Nicklen. "But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat." And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears ... ... ...</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gold</head><p>An estimated 2.5 billion people saw the image: a starving polar bear struggling across an Arctic landscape. "The mission was a success, but there was a problem: We had lost control of the narrative," writes Cristina Mittermeier in National Geographic. Accompanied by a photographic team, she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague Paul Nicklen shot videoall part of their "mission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change," she writes. "When Paul posted the video on Instagram, he wrote, 'This is what starvation looks like.'" He also wondered if all 25,000 polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint. But he didn't say climate change had killed this bear. That nuance vanished when National Geographic posted the video with the subtitles "This is what climate change looks like" and the Washington Post ran a dramatic headline about "gut-wrenching" images. People also responded dramatically, expressing gratitude for validation of climate science, anger the crew hadn't fed the bear, or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming. "Perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didnt know what had happened to this particular polar bear Model "We stood there cryingfilming with tears rolling down our cheeks." That's Paul Nicklen's take on a video he posted in December showing a starving polar bear on an island in the Canadian Arctic, National Geographic reports. The video was shot by Nicklen, a biologist and contributor to National Geographic, during a trip with the conservation group Sea Legacy. It shows the bear on Somerset Island, near the larger Baffin Island, as it searches a garbage can for food. At one point, the bear shows signs of starvation. "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like," Nicklen tells National Geographic. "Bears are going to starve to death.

Avoid using strong colognes such as Axe unless it is in small proportions. If the smell is overbearing, ladies wont want to hang out too close. If you feel the need to use cologne, use it sparingly. Try choosing a deodorant that smells refreshing with a hint of musk.; , Image is important for first impressions. Dont give her the impression that you have a shabby personality because of your clothing. Upgrade some of your t-shirts, jeans, and button down shirts for nicer versions.

Applying these to your lips can temporarily make your lips look fuller, often by irritating them.The plumping effect will only last for a couple of hours, but you can renew it by reapplying the product to your lips. Note that the effects wont be as drastic as those achieved through cosmetic surgery.; , Ingredients like cinnamon, ginger mint, wintergreen, and capsicum will boost blood flow to your lips, causing them to redden and swell i.e., to look fuller., If you wish to combine your lip-plumping product with a lipstick or gloss, apply the plumper to your lips first for maximum effectiveness. Dermatologists recommend against overusing lip-plumping products, as these may cause your lips to become dry and scaly.Try to save the lip plumpers for special occasions. If you want more from your lip-plumping products, consider trying a treatment plumper. Manufacturers claim that treatment plumpers can stimulate your lips into producing more collagen and elastin, making your lips fuller for a longer period of time. Treatment plumpers are available for purchase online and in person at shops that carry beauty products.They may be more expensive than traditional plumpers. To do this they should offer a variety of ways to collect customer card details and process payments. These are often defined by your own technical expertise. It could mean providing a simple means of redirecting customers from your site to their hosted payment pages. Or maybe you require a way for you to authorise payments remotely. Whatever your requirement, a dedicated PSP should have the solutions to meet it. One size does not fit all, so dont let anyone persuade you otherwise.; , A fixed monthly fee starts at around 10, but there are some cheaper options available, starting as low as 0.05 per transaction. As a rule of thumb, the higher your transaction volume, the lower the unit cost. And remember to compare like with like.

Will the PSP with those oh-so-attractive prices charge huge set-up fees for enabling services such as deferred payments, a virtual terminal, or subscriptions that come as standard with other PSPs?. Look beyond the headline figures and consider the overall long-term operational cost of partnering with each PSP. For example, does the PSP have limited support for fraud management? The cost of flimsy security could do much more damage to your bottom line than any fractional differences in rates.

Religion and government are separate, and religion and abortion rights are separate. Condemning someone's entire religion is cruel and divisive. Not all religious people are anti-choice; for example, it is possible for some self identified Christians to be pro-choice. Even if the person in front of you is a flaming bigot, think of the nice religious people, and don't insult their religion. Pro-choice people have long pointed out how "baby" and "unborn child" are manipulative ways to refer to an unwanted fetus. But calling all fetuses "clumps of cells" is also an insensitive use of rhetoric, because there are some fetuses that are truly loved and wanted, and to those parents the fetus is far more special. Stick with the factual term fetus. Dismissing fetuses as mere "clumps of cells" can be deeply upsetting to people who miscarried a loved, wanted fetus.Don't accidentally minimize the hardship of losing a beloved fetus. Transgender men, nonbinary people, and some intersex people of any gender can also get pregnant. Be sure not to step on the toes of transgender people as you fight for the rights of everyone with a uterus. You are not obligated to change anyone's mind, nor do you have to keep talking to someone who says very rude or upsetting things. This may be personally upsetting to you.

Instead of eating a ton of sugar, which is tempting to do when you're tired, try eating complex carbohydrates and protein. Sugar can give you a rush of energy, but then your energy will crash. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, offer more sustained energy, especially when you pair them with protein.For instance, try some natural peanut butter on whole-wheat bread or a piece of fruit with a slice of cheese. Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Therefore, staying hydrated will help keep your energy up. Try sipping on water throughout the day to make sure you get enough. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups and women drink 9 cups of water every day.Other liquids can contribute to your water intake, such as juice and coffee. However, drinking too much juice can pack on extra calories and cause a sugar crash, so try to limit your intake. Also, though you can count caffeinated beverages, you shouldn't make them the majority of the liquid you drink in a day., Keeping something in your mouth, such as a piece of gum, can help increase your alertness.

Drive wooden or plastic stakes around the area to be leveled.; , Attach strings to stretch between the stakes, a few inches above the ground. Attach a string level to the strings to determine the high point. This will usually be your starting point and the rest of the ground will be brought to here, but you can also lower some ground if that makes more sense for your project. Using a tape measure and your level, adjust the strings until you can see how much height needs to be added or taken away across the area you are adjusting. Keep in mind that you may want to adjust the grade of your land to help combat drainage problems. Your land should be graded 1" for every 4', leading away from your home. If you are leveling a small area and it is mostly level, you probably will not need to remove the grass. However, if you have a large area and a lot of leveling to do, removing the grass will be much easier. A simple shovel is all that's necessary for a reasonable amount of space. Depending on how much ground you have to cover and what will be going on the ground afterwards, you'll need to level your land with differing mixtures of soil, sand, and compost/manure fertilizer.

But if you buy direct from a farm, ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered, because you need to chill your meat within 24 hours of that time.In either case, bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour.Once home, place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross-contamination with other items. For a quicker chill, set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest. To further reduce the chance of cross-contamination, set it in the meat compartment, away from other products. Keep the refrigerators temperature at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to 42 degrees, which will help kill bacteria.

He was well known in Georgetown, a practicing Muslim who made bricks and owned land. His portrait was painted in 1819 by Charles Willson Peale and displayed in Peales Philadelphia museum. Yarrow was also painted by James Alexander Simpson, a Georgetown painter. Today the Alexander painting of Yarrow hangs in the Peabody Room of the Georgetown public library branch.

Penelope Cruz had just scored her first lead in a summer blockbuster, as a sexy, feisty swashbuckler opposite her old pal Johnny Depp. By Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Penelope Cruz stars in the latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean 4' movie. By Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY Penelope Cruz stars in the latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean 4' movie. It was a physically arduous six-month shoot for a massive tentpole film, replete with swampwading and swordfighting. And right before filming began on Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Cruz discovered buried treasure of a different sort. "I was pregnant through the whole movie. I found out at the beginning," says Cruz, who, with her typical directness, immediately broke the news to Depp and director Rob Marshall. "I found out before we started, and I wanted them to know because I did not want to go in with any secrets, for protection and for the honesty of my relationship with them. For six months they were all taking such good care of me." It helped that Cruz, 37, handled her pregnancy with pirate-worthy panache, having little morning sickness, nausea or dizziness. She avoided any dangerous stunts in the film, which opens today, and relied heavily on her dance background to learn the intricate fight choreography required of her mercenary buccaneer Angelica, who's vying with Depp's Jack Sparrow to find the Fountain of Youth. For Cruz, it felt "good to be working" while expecting, she says. "I had a lot of free days, and once in a while, I had a free week. (The shoot) was very balanced, very easy. I traveled around the world. The whole summer I spent in Hawaii. It was good. I have only good memories" of the shoot. Fast-forward to a May morning in Manhattan.

The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service has granted seven species of yellow-faced bees native to the islands protection under the Endangered Species Act, which will hopefully allow authorities to implement recovery programs, access funding and limit their harm from outside sources, Gregory Koob of USFW told The Associated Press. The yellow-faced bees population faces a range of threats, like habitat destruction, invasive species both animal and vegetable, and all manner of natural phenomena such as wildfires, hurricanes, tsunamis and droughts. This news represents an important step for bees in general.They and many other pollinating species like butterflies are in danger across the world: About 40 percent of invertebrate pollinating species are facing extinction, according to a U.N. report released in February. This could have devastating effects on global agriculture, as about 75 percent of the worlds crops rely on pollination to grow. The ruling also grants protection to 39 plant species found in Hawaii and three other native animals: the band-romped storm-petrel, the orangeblack Hawaiian damselfly and the anchialine pool shrimp. Bees in certain parts of the U.S. are facing a different threat, as aerial spraying, aimed to combat Zika-spreading mosquitos, is killing hives en masse.Gold A species of bee in Hawaii has been added to the endangered species list, a first for the insect.ModelSeven species of bees in Hawaii have been classified as endangered, the first time the insect has been protected by federal law.

Skip Bayless is a Dallas Cowboys fan. And unlike in past years, that is worth celebrating (which Bayless does quite frequently on Undisputed). At 12-2 the Cowboys are running away from the rest of the NFC, have clinched a playoff berth and have a rookie duo in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott that appears poised to make a deep playoff push in 2017 and beyond. With such a bright future, many Cowboys fans will be searching for a way to suitably express their jubilation. Enter Bayless and DJ Steve Porter with How Bout Them Cowboys. There are a few observations to be made right off the bat. 1) What is that table on set made of and where can it be ordered? The abuse it has taken without breaking is remarkable. 2) There are an extraordinary number of famous people taken aback by Skips passion in 90 seconds. At a glance ... I have a feeling Im about to unleash, youre Cowboy hating, is it Dak is it Zeke? My Cowboys have arrived, are you sleep deprived?

Is it a hit single? Only time will tell. Will the Cowboys use this as inspiration to reach their first Super Bowl since 1996?

A new, forward-thinking generation of coaches not steeped in the 4-4-2 and an unadorned, direct style of football rule the waves in this epoch, they postulate. And this legion of coaches are increasingly young, fresh and, most importantly, American. While there might be some historical merit to the spirit of the argument against the British-style coach, it is perhaps itself a little outdated, not to say somewhat harsh on someone like Carl Robinson and his stylish Vancouver Whitecaps, for instance. Some 20 years on from the birth of Major League Soccer, some of the men who as players helped mold the countrys top division into what it has become today now form an integral portion of the younger cohort of the domestic coaching ranks. Broadly successful elder statesmen like Bruce Arena and Sigi Schmid are followed by a seemingly blossoming rank and file. Head coaches such as Sporting Kansas Citys Peter Vermes. DC Uniteds Ben Olsen. New England Revolutions Jay Heaps. Columbus Crews Gregg Berhalter. New York Red Bulls Jesse Marsch. Behind them, too, are some well-thought-of assistants. Then there are the firmly rooted foreign coaches partly schooled in MLS ways after successful stints in the league. Robinson would be one. As would FC Dallas head coach Oscar Pareja.

If you want to buy snacks in the theater, these are generally your best choice of candy. In addition to being lower calorie than other varieties, they are chewier. This means they're more difficult to eat. If you take longer to finish your candy, you're less likely to return to the concession stand for a second helping.Twizzlers have the lowest calorie count, containing only about 165 calories. Milk duds contain 370 calories, while Starbursts contain 480 calories. Keep in mind, ifyou're on a specific diet plan that restricts sugar, this is not the best route for you. While these snacks are lower calorie, the bulk of the calories come from sugar.; , Many movie theaters now sell protein bars at the counter. You can also sneak one in from a nearby gas station or drug store. Lower calorie protein bars may contain some ingredients you're craving, like nuts and chocolate, while still having some nutrients.Remember to read nutritional labels. Some protein bars may be misleading. In general, it's best to skip bars with a lot of added sugar. Swedish Fish are much lower in sugar than the average movie snack. They also tend to have a tougher texture, making chewing them difficult. If you slow down the pace of your eating, you will eat less overall.A serving of Swedish Fish is about 19 pieces, roughly a large handful, and contains only 140 calories and 29 grams of sugar. Movie theater containers tend to be smaller, so you may find a container that has a single serving. If you can't find a smaller container, try splitting one with a friend. As it can be tricky to find candy that's lower calorie at ... ... ...GoldGo for Twizzlers, Milk Duds, or Starbursts. Buy a protein bar. Look for Swedish Fish.
