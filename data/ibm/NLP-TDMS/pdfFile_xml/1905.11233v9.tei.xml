<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Real-world large-scale datasets usually contain noisy labels and are imbalanced. Therefore, we propose derivative manipulation (DM), a novel and general example weighting approach for training robust deep models under these adverse conditions. DM has two main merits. First, loss function and example weighting are two common techniques in robust learning. In gradient-based optimisation, the role of a loss function is to provide the gradient for back-propagation to update a model, so that the derivative magnitude of an example defines how much impact it has, namely its weight. By DM, we connect the design of loss function and example weighting together. Second, although designing a loss function sometimes has the same effect, we need to care whether a loss is differentiable, and derive its derivative to understand its example weighting scheme. They make the design complicated. Instead, DM is more flexible and straightforward by directly modifying the derivative. Concretely, DM modifies a derivative magnitude function, including transformation and normalisation, after which we term it an emphasis density function, which expresses a weighting scheme. Accordingly, diverse weighting schemes are derived from common probability density functions, including those of well-known robust losses, e.g., MAE and GCE. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of DM on both vision and language tasks.</p></div>

There are two popular approaches, i.e., robust loss design <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref> and example weighting design <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[8]</ref>, due to their easy implementation and widely demonstrated effectiveness. To improve them further, we reveal their connection and unify the design of them via derivative manipulation (DM). On the one hand, the derivative magnitude of an example decides how much impact it has on updating a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">10]</ref>. As a result, a derivative magnitude function defines a weighting scheme over training examples. On the other hand, in gradient-based optimisation, the role of a loss function is to provide gradient used for back-propagation. DM designs the derivative directly so that we do not need to derive it from a loss function. * For source codes, we are happy to offer when there is a request conditioned on pure academic use and kindness to cite this work.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Why do we design a derivative magnitude function instead of a loss function?</head><p>We present two incompatible perspectives on the robustness of a loss function, which motivates us to design the derivative other than a loss function: (1) Loss value. From this viewpoint, a loss function, which is less sensitive to large errors (i.e. residuals), is more robust and preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">12]</ref>. For example, absolute error is considered more robust than squared error. An outlier has a larger error by definition, but its loss value should not increase dramatically when a robust loss function is applied.</p><p>(2) Derivative magnitude. A more robust model is less affected by noisy data than clean data. Therefore, a noisy example should have a smaller derivative magnitude. Whether a larger loss value corresponds to a larger derivative depends on a specific loss function. When an example has a large loss value, its derivative can be so small that its effect is negligible. As a consequence, two viewpoints are obviously inconsistent. We remark the first one is misleading. We support the second because the role of a loss is offering the gradient to back-propagate as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>. Accordingly, we propose DM which manipulates the derivative directly so that we do not need to derive it from a loss.</p><p>Beyond, the derivative magnitude defines an example weighting scheme. Although it is feasible to design a loss function which offers the desired derivative, we need to consider whether it is differentiable and derive its derivative to get its underlying weighting scheme. This "two-step" procedure makes the design of a loss more complicated than DM.</p><p>1.2 Using an emphasis density function to mathematically express example weighting DM nonlinearly transforms the derivative magnitude, followed by derivative normalisation (DN) so that the total emphasis (weight) is one unit. We term a normalised derivative magnitude function an Emphasis Density Function (EDF), which explicitly defines an example-level weighting scheme over data points. An EDF considers emphasis mode and variance, being analogous to a probability density function (PDF), thus we can design an EDF according to existing PDFs. Emphasis mode represents examples whose weight values are the largest. Depending on a scenario, it can be adjusted to focus on easy, semi-hard, or hard examples. Therefore, DM is a superset of existing (heuristicallydesigned) example weighting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">15]</ref>. Emphasis variance decides the spread of emphasis (weight), i.e., the variance of an EDF curve. Intuitively, examples of greater "interest" should contribute more to a model's update. Emphasis variance controls how significantly they are emphasised. Some representative EDFs are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1b</ref>.</p><p>We summarise our contributions: (1) We propose a novel approach that unifies the design of example weighting and loss function in a single framework. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The effects of example weighting and loss function are generally overlapped. To understand why DM works and is superior, we revisit two key concepts: Rethinking existing robustness theorems on loss functions. In the prior work, when judging the robustness of a loss function, its example weighting scheme is not considered. Instead, its robustness is judged according to its sensitivity to large errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">16]</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> proposed theorems showing that a deep model is robust to label noise when the loss function is symmetric and bounded. Accordingly, they claimed that Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) are decreasingly robust, which is not the fact. Because in this work we find CCE is very competitive with MAE, MSE and Generalised Cross Entropy (GCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[5]</ref>. However, CCE is neither bounded nor symmetric.</p><p>Rethinking proposed example weighting schemes. Many weighting schemes have been proposed for different purposes: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(1)</ref> Easier examples are preferred (Examples with lower error/loss are inferred to be easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[2]</ref>). For example, curriculum learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[17]</ref> picks easier examples in early training. Self-paced learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[18]</ref> increases the weights of more difficult examples gradually. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(2)</ref> Harder examples are emphasised: Hard example mining is demonstrated to accelerate convergence and improve performance in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[21]</ref>. However, note that the derivative magnitude of a loss function also defines a weighting scheme. Then it becomes the interaction between a proposed weighting scheme and the one from a loss function works in previous work. Instead, in DM, there is only one weighting scheme. We compare it with other weighting methods in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>

We analyse several well-known losses and find that their derivatives share the same direction, which indicates they share the same optimisation objective although their loss expressions are different. They perform differently only due to the derivate magnitude, which theoretically (mathematically) demonstrates that it is the key.</p><p>We propose DM to systematically study the derivative magnitude in which the derivative's direction is kept the same as those losses. We choose L 1 norm to measure the magnitude of derivative because its expression is simpler than other norms. For clarity, we formally define the emphasis mode and variance. Definition 1 (Emphasis Mode ψ). It refers to those examples that own the largest weight. In DM, an example's weight is only decided by its p i . For brevity, we define ψ to be p i of examples whose weights are the largest, i.e., ψ = arg max pi w i , ψ ∈ [0, 1]. Definition 2 (Emphasis Variance σ). It is the weight variance over all data points in a batch and is defined by the variance of an EDF curve, which affects the impact ratio between two examples.</p></div>

Despite this, the overall optimisation objective is unchanged and consistent with common losses as discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>To demonstrate DM's value as a useful example weighting framework, we conduct extensive experiments, including robust image classification on synthetic and real-world large-scale datasets, robust video retrieval on a large-scale dataset and robust sentiment analysis of movie reviews. Beyond label noise, all real-world datasets are highly imbalanced, e.g., the number of videos per person ranges from 1 to 271 in MARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[22]</ref>, while the number of images per class varies between 18,976 and 88,588 in Clothing 1M <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[23]</ref>. In our experiments, we fix the random seed as 123 and do not apply any random computational accelerator for the purpose of exact reproducibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">A premise for setting the emphasis mode when noisy labels exist</head><p>DM has two key components: (1) We optimise the emphasis mode according to an intuition: e.g., when there exists more noise, we use a relatively larger emphasis mode to emphasise on easier examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">6]</ref>; (2) After an emphasis mode is set, we can search for the best emphasis variance if a validation set is given. Concretely, when training data is clean, we set λ = 0 so that w DM</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">i = exp(β(1 − p i )) ⇒ ψ DM = 0.</formula><p>When label noise exists, we increase λ so that ψ DM increases and easier samples become the emphasis mode. For more justification, we present the following premise:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Premise 1.</formula><p>Difficult examples have smaller probabilities of being predicted to its annotated labels, i.e., smaller p i . Abnormal examples, including noisy ones and outliers, belong to those difficult ones. This premise is justified in recent work: <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[24]</ref> shows that DNNs do not fit real datasets by brute-force memorisation. Instead, DNNs learn simple shared patterns before memorising difficult abnormal data points. Consequently, abnormal samples have smaller p i than easier ones.</p><p>In addition, we present our empirical evidence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. The learning dynamics prove this premise and DM is superior to CCE: (a) The p i of clean examples increases while that of noisy ones has no noticeable rise in DM, which means DM hinders fitting of abnormal examples and preserves DNNs' ability to learn on clean data; (b) DM has the best test accuracy. Furthermore, it is robust, i.e., early stopping is unnecessary. (c) As we increase noise rate, the optimised emphasis mode also increases  showing a positive correlation between them. A thorough ablation study on the emphasis mode and variance are reported in the supplementary material. Remark 1. In the early training phase, p i is awfully random and non-informative, what does DM do? At this phase, DM weights examples randomly since p i is random. It is the same in all common losses (weighting schemes). Although nothing makes sense at the beginning, including random initialisation, loss values and weighting schemes, DNNs gradually learn meaningful patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[24]</ref>. Therefore, DM boosts learning gradually as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>

(1) CIFAR-10/100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[25]</ref>, which contain 10 and 100 classes, respectively. The image size is 32 × 32. In CIFAR-10, the training data contains 5k images per class while the test set includes 1k images per class. CIFAR-100 has 500 images per class for training and 100 images per class for testing.

A video's representation is simply the average fusion of its frames' representations. The learning rate starts from 0.01 and is divided by 2 every 10k iterations. We stop training at 50k iterations. We apply an SGD optimiser with a weight decay of 5e − 4 and a momentum of 0.9. The batch size is 180. Data augmentation is the same as Clothing 1M. At testing, we first L 2 normalise videos' features and then calculate the cosine similarity.</p></div>

Although DRSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[44]</ref> and CAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[45]</ref> exploit extra temporal information by incorporating attention mechanisms, DM is superior to them in terms of both effectiveness and simplicity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.2 Empirical Analysis of DM on CIFAR-10</head><p>To empirically understand DM well, we explore the behaviours of DM on CIFAR-10 with r = 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, respectively. We use ResNet-56 which has larger capacity than ResNet-20.</p><p>Design choices. We mainly analyse the impact of different emphasis modes for different noise rates. We explore five emphasis modes: 1) None: β = 0. There is no emphasis mode since all examples are treated equally; 2) 0: λ = 0; 3) 1 3 : λ = 0.5; 4) 1 2 : λ = 1; 5) 2 3 : λ = 2. We remark that when λ is larger, the emphasis mode is higher, leading to relatively easier training data points are emphasised. When emphasis mode changes, emphasis variance changes accordingly. Therefore, to set a proper spread for each emphasis mode, we try four emphasis variances and choose the best one 3 to study the impact of emphasis mode.</p><p>Results analysis. We show the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 10</ref>. The intact training set serves as an indicator of meaningful fitting and we observe that its accuracy is always consistent with the final test accuracy. We display the training dynamics in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>. We summarise our observations as follows: Fitting and generalisation. We observe that CCE always achieves the best accuracy on corrupted training sets, which indicates that CCE has a strong data fitting ability even if there is severe noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[51]</ref>. As a result, CCE has much worse final test accuracy than most models. Emphasising on harder examples. When there exists label noise, we obtain the worst final test accuracy if emphasis mode is 0, i.e., CCE and DM with λ = 0. This unveils that in applications where we have to learn from noisy training data, it will hurt the model's generalisation dramatically if we use CCE or simply focus on harder training data points. Emphasis mode. When noise rate is 0, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, we obtain the best final test accuracy when λ = 0, λ = 0.5, λ = 1, λ = 2, and λ = 2, respectively. This demonstrates that when noise rate is higher, we can improve a model's robustness by moving emphasis mode towards relatively less difficult examples with a larger λ, which is informative in practice. Emphasis spread. As displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figures 6-9</ref> in the supplementary material, emphasis variance also matters a lot when fixing emphasis mode, i.e., fixing λ. For example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 10</ref> , when λ = 0, although focusing on harder examples similarly with CCE, DM can outperform CCE by modifying the emphasis variance. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figures 6-9</ref>, some models even collapse and cannot converge if the emphasis variance is not rational.</p></div>
