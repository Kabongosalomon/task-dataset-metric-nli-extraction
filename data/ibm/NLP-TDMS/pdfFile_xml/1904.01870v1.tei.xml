<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Supervised depth estimation has achieved high accuracy due to the advanced deep network architectures. Since the groundtruth depth labels are hard to obtain, recent methods try to learn depth estimation networks in an unsupervised way by exploring unsupervised cues, which are effective but less reliable than true labels. An emerging way to resolve this dilemma is to transfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain adaptation techniques. However, these approaches overlook specific geometric structure of the natural images in the target domain (i.e., real data), which is important for highperforming depth prediction. Motivated by the observation, we propose a geometry-aware symmetric domain adaptation framework (GASDA) to explore the labels in the synthetic data and epipolar geometry in the real data jointly. Moreover, by training two image style translators and depth estimators symmetrically in an end-to-end network, our model achieves better image style transfer and generates high-quality depth maps. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and comparable performance against the state-of-the-art. Code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ sshan-zhao/GASDA.</p></div>

Recent years have witnessed the great strides in this task, especially after deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) were exploited to estimate depth from a single image successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Until now, there have been lots of follow-up works <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> improving or extending this work. However, since the proposed deep models are trained  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) and synthetic image for training (vKITTI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), intermediate generated images in our approach, ground truth depth map and estimated depth map using proposed GASDA.</p><p>in a fully supervised fashion, they require a large amount of data with ground truth depth, which is expensive to acquire in practice. To address this issue, unsupervised monocular depth estimation has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, using geometry-based cues and without the need of image-depth pairs during training. Unfortunately, this kind of method tends to be vulnerable to illumination change, occlusion and blurring and so on. Compared to real-world data, synthetic data is much easier to obtain the depth map. As a result, some works propose to exploit synthetic data for visual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. However, due to domain shift from synthetic to real, the model trained on synthetic data often fails to perform well on real data. To deal with this issue, domain adaptation techniques are utilized to reduce the discrepancy between datasets/domains 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>Existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref> using synthetic data via domain adaptation have achieved impressive performance for monocular depth estimation. These approaches typically perform domain adaptation either based on synthetic-torealistic translation or inversely. However, due to the lack of paired images, the image translation function usually introduces undesirable distortions in addition to the style change. The distorted image structures significantly degrade the performance of successive depth prediction. Fortunately, the unsupervised cues in the real images, for example, stereo pairs, produces additional constraints on the possible depth predictions. Therefore, it is essential to simultaneously explore both synthetic and real images and the corresponding depth cues for generating higher-quality depth maps.</p><p>Motivated by the above analysis, we propose a Geometry-Aware Symmetric Domain Adaptation Network (GASDA) for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. This framework consists of two main parts, namely symmetric style translation and monocular depth estimation. Inspired by CycleGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, our GASDA employs both synthetic-to-realistic and realistic-to-synthetic translations coupled with a geometry consistency loss based on the epipolar geomery of the real stereo images. Our network is learned by groundtruth labels from the synthetic domain as well as the epipolar geometry of the real domain. Additionally, the learning process in the real and synthetic domains can be regularized by enforcing consistency on the depth predictions. By training the style translation and depth prediction networks in an end-to-end fashion, our model is able to translate images without distorting the geometric and semantic content, and thus achieves better depth prediction performance. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose an end-to-end domain adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation. The model can generate high-quality results for both image style translation and depth estimation.</p><p>• We show that training the monocular depth estimator using ground truth depth in the synthetic domain coupled with the epipolar geometry in the real domain can boost the performance.</p><p>• We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on KITTI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and the generalization performance on Make3D dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Method Overview</head><p>Given a set of N synthetic image-depth pairs {(x i s , y i s )} N i=1 (i.e., source domain X s ), our goal here is to learn a monocular depth estimation model which can accurately predict depth for natural images contained in X t (i.e., target domain). It is difficult to guarantee the model generalize well to the real data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref> due to the domain shift. We thus provide a remedy by exploiting the epipolar geometry between stereo images and developing a geometry-aware symmetric domain adaptation network (GASDA). Our GASDA consists of two main parts like existing works, including the style transfer network and the monocular depth estimation network.</p><p>Specifically, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, we consider both synthetic-to-real <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and real-to-synthetic translations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. As a result, we can train two depth estimators F s and F t on the original synthetic data (X s ) and the generated realistic data (G s2t (X s )) using the generator G s2t in supervised manners, respectively. These two models are complementary, since F s has clean training set X s but dirty test set G t2s (X t ) generated by the generator G t2s with noises, such as distortion and blurs, caused by unsatisfied translation, and vise verse for F t . Nevertheless, because the depth information is rather relevant to specific scene geometry which might be different between source and target domains, the models trained on X s or G s2t (X s ) still could fail to perform well on G t2s (X t ) or X t . To provide a solution, we exploit the epipolar geometry of real stereo pairs {(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i t l , x i tr )} M i=1</formula><p>(x i t l and x i tr represent the left and right image respectively 2 ) during training to encourage F t and F s to capture the relevant geometric structure of target/real data. In addition, we introduce an additional depth consistency loss to enforce the predictions from F t and F s are consistent in local regions. The overall framework of GASDA is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. For simplicity, we will omit the superscript i in most cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">GASDA</head><p>Bidirectional Style Transfer Loss Our goal here is to learn the bidirectional translators G s2t and G t2s to bridge the gap between the source domain (synthetic) X s and the target domain (real) X t . Specifically, taking G s2t as an example, we expect the G s2t (x s ) to be indistinguishable from real images in X t . We thus employ a discriminator D t , and train G s2t and D t in an adversarial fashion by performing a minimax game following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The adversarial losses are expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L gan (G s2t , D t , X t , X s ) =E xt∼Xt [D t (x t ) − 1]+ E xs∼Xs [D t (G s2t (x s ))], L gan (G t2s , D s , X t , X s ) =E xs∼Xs [D s (x s ) − 1]+ E xt∼Xt [D s (G t2s (x t ))].<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Unluckily, the vanilla GANs suffer from mode collapse. To provide a remedy and ensure the input images and the output images paired up in a meaningful way, we utilize the cycle-consistency loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Specifically, when feeding an image x s to G s2t and G t2s orderly, the output should be a reconstruction of x s , and vice versa for</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x t , i.e. G t2s (G s2t (x s )) ≈ x s and G s2t (G t2s (x t )) ≈ x t .</formula><p>The cycle consistency loss has the form as:  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: The proposed framework in this paper. It consists of two main parts: image style translation and monocular depth estimation. i) Style translation network, incorporating two generators (i.e., Gs2t and Gt2s) and two discriminators (i.e., Dt and Ds), is based on CycleGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. ii) Monocular depth estimation network contains two complementary sub-networks (i.e., Fs and Ft). We omit the side outputs, for brevity. More details can be found in Section 3, Section 4.1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L cyc (G t2s , G s2t ) = E xs∼Xs [||G t2s (G s2t (x s )) − x s || 1 ] + E xt∼Xt [||G s2t (G t2s (x t )) − x t || 1 ].<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Apart from the adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss, we also employ an identity mapping loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> to encourage the generators to preserve geometric content. The identity mapping loss is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L idt (G t2s , G s2t , X s , X t ) = E xs∼Xs [||G t2s (x s ) − x s || 1 ] + E xt∼Xt [||G s2t (x t ) − x t || 1 ].</formula><p>(3) The full objective for the bidirectional style transfer is as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L trans (G t2s , G s2t , D t , D s ) = L gan (G s2t , D t , X t , X s ) + L gan (G t2s , D s , X t , X s ) + λ 1 L cyc (G t2s , G s2t ) + λ 2 L idt (G t2s , G s2t , X t , X s )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where λ 1 and λ 2 are the trade-off parameters. Depth Estimation Loss We can now render the synthetic images to the "style" of the target domain (KITTI), and then capture a new dataset X s2t = G s2t (X s ). We train a depth estimation network F t on X s2t in a supervised manner using the provided ground truth depth in the synthetic domain X s . Here, we minimize the 1 distance between the predicted depthỹ ts and ground truth depth y s :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L tde (F t , G s2t ) = ||y s −ỹ ts ||.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In addition to F t , we also train a complementary depth estimator F s on X s directly with the 1 loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L sde (F s ) = ||y s −ỹ ss ||<label>(6)</label></formula><p>whereỹ ss = F s (x s ) is the output of F s . Both the F s and F t are important backbones to alleviate the issue of geometry and semantic inconsistency coupled with the subsequent losses. The full depth estimation loss is expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L de (F t , F s , G s2t ) = L sde (F s ) + L tde (F t , G s2t ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Geometry Consistency Loss Combining the components above, we have already formulated a naive depth adversarial adaptation framework. However, the G s2t and G t2s are usually imperfect, which would make the predictions y st = F s (G t2s (x t )) andỹ tt = F t (x t ) unsatisfied. Besides, previous depth adaptation approaches overlook the specific physical geometric structure which may vary from scenes/datasets. Our main objective is to accurately estimate depth for real scenes, so we consider the geometric structure of the target data in the training phase. To this end, we present a geometric constraint on F t and F s by exploiting the epipolar geometry of real stereo images and unsupervised cues. Specifically, we generate an inverse warped image from the right image using the predicted depth, to reconstruct the left. We thus combine an 1 with single scale SSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> term as the geometry consistency loss to align the stereo images: where L gc represents the full geometry consistency loss, L tgc and L sgc denote the geometry consistency loss of F t and F s respectively. x tt (x st ) is the inverse warp of x tr using bilinear sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> based on the estimated depth map y tt (y st ), the baseline distance between the cameras and the camera focal length <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In our experiments, η is set to be 0.85, and µ is 0.15.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L tgc (F t ) = η 1 − SSIM (x t , x tt ) 2 + µ||x t − x tt ||, L sgc (F s , G t2s ) = η 1 − SSIM (x t , x st ) 2 + µ||x t − x st ||, L gc (F t , F s , G t2s ) = L tgc (F t ) + L sgc (F s , G t2s )<label>(8)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depth Smoothness Loss</head><p>To encourage depths to be consistent in local homogeneous regions, we exploit an edgeaware depth smoothness loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L ds (F t , F s , G t2s ) = e −∇xt ||∇ỹ tt || + e −∇xt ||∇ỹ st || (9)</formula><p>where ∇ is the first derivative along spatial directions. We only apply the smoothness loss to X t and X t2s (real data), since X s and X s2t (synthetic data) have full supervision. Depth Consistency Loss We find that the predictions for x t , i.e., F t (x t ) and F s (G t2s (x t )), show inconsistency in many regions, which is in contrast to our intuition. One of the possible reason is that G t2s might fail to translate x t with details. To enforce such coherence, we introduce an 1 depth consistency loss with respect toỹ tt andỹ st as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L dc (F t , F s , G t2s ) = ||ỹ tt −ỹ st ||.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Full Objective Our final loss function has the form as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L(G s2t , G t2s , D t , D s , F t , F s ) = L trans (G s2t , G t2s , D t , D s ) + γ 1 L de (F t , F s , G s2t ) + γ 2 L gc (F t , F s , G t2s ) + γ 3 L dc (F t , F s , G t2s ) + γ 4 L ds (F t , F s , G t2s )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where γ n (n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}) are trade-off factors. We optimize this objective function in an end-to-end deep network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Inference</head><p>In the inference phase, we aim to predict the depth map for a given image in real domain (e.g. KITTI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) using the resultant models. In fact, there are two paths acquiring predicted depth maps: x t → F t (x t ) →ỹ tt and x t → G t2s (x t ) → x t2s → F s (x t2s ) →ỹ st , as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, and the final prediction is the average ofỹ tt and y st :ỹ t = 1 2</p><p>(ỹ tt +ỹ st ).</p></div>

The networks in each group share the identical network architecture but are with different parameters. Specifically, we employ generators (G s2t and G t2s ) and discriminators (D s and D t ) provided by CycleGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. For monocular depth estimators F t and F s , we utilize the standard encoderdecoder structures with skip-connections and side outputs as <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Datasets The target domain is KITTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, which is a realworld computer vision benchmark consisting of 42, 382 rectified stereo pairs in the resolution about 375 × 1242. In our experiments, the ground truth depth maps provided by KITTI are only for evaluation purpose. The source domain is Virtual KITTI (vKITTI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which contains 50 photorealistic synthetic videos with 21, 260 image-depth pairs of size 375 × 1242. Additionally, in order to study the generalization performance of our approach, we also apply the trained model to Make3D dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Since Make3D does not offer stereo images, we directly evaluate our model on the test split without training or further fine-tuning. Training Details We implement GASDA in PyTorch. We train our model in a two-stage manner, i.e., a warming up stage and end-to-end iteratively updating stage. In the warming up stage, we first optimize the style transfer networks for 10 epochs with the momentum of β 1 = 0.5, β 2 = 0.999, and the initial learning rate of α = 0.0002 using the ADAM solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Then we train F t on {X t , G s2t (X s )}, and F s on {X s , G t2s (X t )} for around 20 epochs by setting β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.999, and α = 0.0001. To make style translators generate high-quality images, so as to improve the subsequent depth estimators, we fine-tune the network in an end-to-end iteratively updating fashion as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. In specific, we optimize G s2t and G t2s with the supervision of F t and F s for m epochs, and then train F s and F t for n epochs. We set m = 3 and n = 7 in our experiments, and repeat this process until the network converges (around 40 epochs). In this stage, we employ the same momentum and solver as the first stage with the learning rates of 2e − 6 and 1e − 5 for the two respectively. The trade-off factors are set to λ 1 = 10, λ 2 = 30, γ 1 = 50, γ 2 = 50  and γ 3 = 50 and γ 4 = 0.5. In the training phase, we downsample all the images to 192×640, and increase the training set size using some common data augmentation strategies, including random horizontal flipping, rotation with the degrees of [−5 • , 5 • ], and brightness adjustment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">KITTI Dataset</head><p>We test our models on the 697 images extracted from 29 scenes, and use all the 23, 488 images contained in other 32 scenes for training <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr">600)</ref> and validation (888) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.

Note that, the maximum depth value in vKITTI is 655.35m instead of 80m in KITTI, but unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, we do not clip the depth maps of vKITTI to 80m during training. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, we report the benchmark scores on the Eigen split <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> where the training sets are only KITTI and vKITTI. GASDA obtains a convincible improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we make the comparisons with two baselines, i.e., All synthetic (baseline1, trained on labeled synthetic data) and All real (baseline2, trained on real stereo pairs), and the latest domain adaptation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and (semi-)supervised/unsupervised methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. The significant improvements in all the metrics demonstrate the superiority of our method. Note that, GASDA yields   <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.

GASDA cannot outperform <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in the Eigen split. The main reason is that the synthetic images employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> are captured from GTA5 3 , and the domain shift between GTA5 and KITTI is not that significant than the one between vKITTI and KITTI. In addition, the training set size in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is about three times than ours. However, GASDA performs competitively on the official KITTI stereo 2015 dataset and Make3D compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, as reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2 and Table 4</ref>. Apart from quantitative results, we also show some example outputs in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Our approach preserves more details, and is able to recover depth information of small objects, such as the distant cars and rails, and generate clear boundaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Make3D Dataset</head><p>To discuss the generalization capabilities of GASDA, we evaluate our approach on Make3D dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> quantita-3 https://github.com/aitorzip/DeepGTAV. tively and qualitatively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Ablation Study</head><p>Here, we conduct a series of ablations to analyze our approach. Quantitative results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, and some sampled results for style transfer are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Domain Adaptation We first demonstrate the effectiveness of domain adaptation by comparing two simple models, i.e. SYN (F s trained on X s ) and SYN2REAL (F t trained on G s2t (X s )). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, SYN cannot capture satisfied scores on KITTI due to the domain shift. After the translation, the domain shift is reduced which means that the synthetic data distribution is relative closer to real data distribution. Thus, SYN2REAL is able to generalize better to real images. Further, we train the style translators (G s2t and G t2s ) and the depth estimation network (F t ) in an end-to-end fashion (SYN2REAL-E2E), which guides to a further improvement as compared to SYN2REAL. As a conclusion, the depth estimation network can improve the style transfer by providing a pixel-wise semantic constraint to the translation networks. Moreover, we can also observe the improvement in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> by comparing the translation results of original CycleGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> with ours. Geometry Consistency We then study the significance of the geometric constraint coming from stereo images   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results on 134 test images of Make3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Trained * indicates whether the model is trained on Make3D or not. Errors are computed for depths less than 70m in a central image crop <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. It can be observed that our approach is comparable with those trained on Make3D.</p><p>based on the epipolar geometry. In specific, we employ the stereo images provided by KITTI when optimizing F t in SYN2REAL-E2E. We enforce the geometry consistency between the stereo images as a constraint as stated in Eq. 8. The model SYN2REAL-GC-E2E outperforms SYN2REAL-E2E by a large margin, which demonstrates that the geometry consistency constraint can significantly improve standard domain adaptation frameworks.</p><p>On the other hand, the comparisons among SYN2REAL-GC, SYN-GC (trained on real data and synthetic data without domain adaptation) and REAL (F t trained on real stereo images without extra data) can show the significance of synthetic data with ground truth depth and domain adaptation. Symmetric Domain Adaptation In contrast to previous works, we expect to fully take advantage of the bidirectional style translators G s2t and G t2s . Thus, we learn REAL2SYN-SYN-GC-E2E whose network architecture is symmetrical to the aforementioned SYN2REAL-GC-E2E. We jointly optimized the two coupled with a depth consistency loss. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, GASDA is superior than GASDA-w/oDC which demonstrates the effectiveness of the depth consistency loss. In addition, the comparisons (GASDA-F t v.s. SYN2ERAL-GC-E2E and GASDA-F s v.s. REAL2SYN-GC-E2E) show that the two can benefit each other in the jointly training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework GASDA, which trains the monocular depth estimation model using the labelled synthetic data coupled with the epipolar geometry of real stereo data in a unified and symmetric deep learning network. Our main motivation is learning a depth estimation model from synthetic image-depth pairs in a supervised fashion, and at the same time taking into account the specific scene geometry information of the target data. Moreover, to alleviate the issues caused by domain shift, we reduce the domain discrepancy using the bidirectional image style transfer. Finally, we implement image translation and depth estimation in an end-to-end network so that then can improve each other. Experiments on KITTI and Make3D datasets show GASDA is able to generate desirable results quantitatively and qualitatively, and generalize well to unseen datasets.</p></div>
