<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recurrent neural networks are powerful models for processing sequential data, but they are generally plagued by vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs), which use unitary recurrence matrices, have recently been proposed as a means to avoid these issues. However, in previous experiments, the recurrence matrices were restricted to be a product of parameterized unitary matrices, and an open question remains: when does such a parameterization fail to represent all unitary matrices, and how does this restricted representational capacity limit what can be learned? To address this question, we propose full-capacity uRNNs that optimize their recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. Our contribution consists of two main components. First, we provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity. Using this argument, we show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. Second, we show how a complete, full-capacity unitary recurrence matrix can be optimized over the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices. The resulting multiplicative gradient step is very simple and does not require gradient clipping or learning rate adaptation. We confirm the utility of our claims by empirically evaluating our new full-capacity uRNNs on both synthetic and natural data, achieving superior performance compared to both LSTMs and the original restricted-capacity uRNNs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Deep feed-forward and recurrent neural networks have been shown to be remarkably effective in a wide variety of problems. A primary difficulty in training using gradient-based methods has been the so-called vanishing or exploding gradient problem, in which the instability of the gradients over multiple layers can impede learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. This problem is particularly keen for recurrent networks, since the repeated use of the recurrent weight matrix can magnify any instability.</p><p>This problem has been addressed in the past by various means, including gradient clipping <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, using orthogonal matrices for initialization of the recurrence matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, or by using pioneering architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or gated recurrent units <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Recently, several innovative architectures have been introduced to improve information flow in a network: residual networks, which directly pass information from previous layers up in a feed-forward network <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and attention networks, which allow a recurrent network to access past activations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The idea of using a unitary recurrent weight matrix was introduced so that the gradients are inherently stable and do not vanish or explode <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The resulting unitary recurrent neural network (uRNN) is complex-valued and uses a complex form of the rectified linear activation function. However, this idea was investigated using, as we show, a potentially restricted form of unitary matrices.</p><p>The two main components of our contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We provide a theoretical argument to determine the smallest dimension N for which any parameterization of the unitary recurrence matrix does not cover the entire set of all unitary matrices. The argument relies on counting real-valued parameters and using Sard's theorem to show that the smooth map from these parameters to the unitary manifold is not onto. Thus, we can show that a previously proposed parameterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> cannot represent all unitary matrices larger than 7 × 7. Thus, such a parameterization results in what we refer to as a restricted-capacity unitary recurrence matrix.</p><p>2) To overcome the limitations of restricted-capacity parameterizations, we propose a new method for stochastic gradient descent for training the unitary recurrence matrix, which constrains the gradient to lie on the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices. This approach allows us to directly optimize a complete, or full-capacity, unitary matrix. Neither restricted-capacity nor full-capacity unitary matrix optimization require gradient clipping. Furthermore, full-capacity optimization still achieves good results without adaptation of the learning rate during training.</p><p>To test the limitations of a restricted-capacity representation and to confirm that our full-capacity uRNN does have practical implications, we test restricted-capacity and full-capacity uRNNs on both synthetic and natural data tasks. These tasks include synthetic system identification, long-term memorization, frame-to-frame prediction of speech spectra, and pixel-by-pixel classification of handwritten digits. Our proposed full-capacity uRNNs generally achieve equivalent or superior performance on synthetic and natural data compared to both LSTMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the original restrictedcapacity uRNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In the next section, we give an overview of unitary recurrent neural networks. Section 3 presents our first contribution: the theoretical argument to determine if any unitary parameterization has restricted-capacity. Section 4 describes our second contribution, where we show how to optimize a full-capacity unitary matrix. We confirm our results with simulated and natural data in Section 5 and present our conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Estimating the representation capacity of structured unitary matrices</head><p>In this section, we state and prove a theorem that can be used to determine when any particular unitary parameterization does not have capacity to represent all unitary matrices. As an application of this theorem, we show that the parameterization (3) does not have the capacity to cover all N × N unitary matrices for N &gt; 7. First, we establish an upper bound on the number of real-valued parameters required to represent any N × N unitary matrix. Then, we state and prove our theorem. </p></div>

A skew-Hermitian matrix is any</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">A ∈ C N ×N such that A = −A H , where (·) H is the conjugate transpose.</formula><p>To determine the dimension of U (N ), we can determine the dimension of u. Because of the skew-Hermitian constraint, the diagonal elements of A are purely imaginary, which corresponds to N real-valued parameters. Also, since A i,j = −A * j,i , the upper and lower triangular parts of A are parameterized by N (N −1) 2 complex numbers, which corresponds to an additional N 2 − N real parameters. Thus, U (N ) is a manifold of dimension N 2 .</p><p>Theorem 3.2 If a family of N × N unitary matrices is parameterized by P real-valued parameters for P &lt; N 2 , then it cannot contain all N × N unitary matrices.</p><p>Proof: We consider a family of unitary matrices that is parameterized by P real-valued parameters through a smooth map g : P(P ) → U(N 2 ) from the space of parameters P(P ) to the space of all unitary matrices U(N 2 ). The space P(P ) of parameters is considered as a P -dimensional manifold, while the space U(N 2 ) of all unitary matrices is an N 2 -dimensional manifold according to lemma 3.1. Then, if P &lt; N 2 , Sard's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> implies that the image g(P) of g is of measure zero in U(N 2 ), and in particular g is not onto. Since g is not onto, there must exist a unitary matrix W ∈ U(N 2 ) for which there is no corresponding input P ∈ P(P ) such that W = g(P). Thus, if P is such that P &lt; N 2 , the manifold P(P ) cannot represent all unitary matrices in U(N 2 ).</p><p>We now apply Theorem 3.2 to the parameterization (3). Note that the parameterization (3) has P = 7N real-valued parameters. If we solve for N in 7N &lt; N 2 , we get N &gt; 7. Thus, the parameterization (3) cannot represent all unitary matrices for dimension N &gt; 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Optimizing full-capacity unitary matrices on the Stiefel manifold</head><p>In this section, we show how to get around the limitations of restricted-capacity parameterizations and directly optimize a full-capacity unitary matrix. We consider the Stiefel manifold of all N × N complex-valued matrices whose columns are N orthonormal vectors in C N <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Mathematically, the Stiefel manifold is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V N (C N ) = W ∈ C N ×N : W H W = I N ×N .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">any W ∈ V N (C N ), any matrix Z in the tangent space T W V N (C N ) of the Stiefel manifold satisfies Z H W − W H Z = 0 [14]</formula><p>. The Stiefel manifold becomes a Riemannian manifold when its tangent space is equipped with an inner product. Tagare <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggests using the canonical inner product, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Z 1 , Z 2 c = tr Z H 1 (I − 1 2 WW H )Z 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Under this canonical inner product on the tangent space, the gradient in the Stiefel manifold of the loss function f with respect to the matrix W is AW, where A = G H W − W H G is a skew-Hermitian matrix and G with G i,j = δf δWi,j is the usual gradient of the loss function f with respect to the matrix W <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Using these facts, Tagare <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggests a descent curve along the Stiefel manifold at training iteration k given by the matrix product of the Cayley transformation of A (k) with the current solution W (k) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Y (k) (λ) = I + λ 2 A (k) −1 I − λ 2 A (k) W (k) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where λ is a learning rate and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">A (k) = G (k) H W (k) − W (k) H G (k) . Gradient descent proceeds by performing updates W (k+1) = Y (k) (λ).</formula><p>Tagare <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> suggests an Armijo-Wolfe search along the curve to adapt λ, but such a procedure would be expensive for neural network optimization since it requires multiple evaluations of the forward model and gradients. We found that simply using a fixed learning rate λ often works well. Also, RMSprop-style scaling of the gradient G (k) by a running average of the previous gradients' norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> before applying the multiplicative step <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(6)</ref> can improve convergence. The only additional substantial computation required beyond the forward and backward passes of the network is the N × N matrix inverse in (6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>All models are implemented in Theano <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, based on the implementation of restricted-capacity uRNNs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, available from https://github.com/amarshah/complex_RNN. All code to replicate our results is available from https://github.com/stwisdom/urnn. All models use RMSprop <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for optimization, except that full-capacity uRNNs optimize their recurrence matrices with a fixed learning rate using the update step (6) and optional RMSprop-style gradient normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Synthetic data</head><p>First, we compare the performance of full-capacity uRNNs to restricted-capacity uRNNs and LSTMs on two tasks with synthetic data. The first task is synthetic system identification, where a uRNN must learn the dynamics of a target uRNN given only samples of the target uRNN's inputs and outputs. The second task is the copy memory problem, in which the network must recall a sequence of data after a long period of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">System identification</head><p>For the task of system identification, we consider the problem of learning the dynamics of a nonlinear dynamical system that has the form (1), given a dataset of inputs and outputs of the system. We will draw a true system W sys randomly from either a constrained set W u of restricted-capacity unitary matrices using the parameterization W u (θ u ) in (3) or from a wider set W g of restricted-capacity unitary matrices that are guaranteed to lie outside W u . We sample from W g by taking a matrix product of two unitary matrices drawn from W u .</p><p>We use a sequence length of T = 150, and we set the input dimension M and output dimension L both equal to the hidden state dimension N . The input-to-hidden transformation V and output-tohidden transformation U are both set to identity, the output bias c is set to 0, the initial state is set to 0, and the hidden bias b is drawn from a uniform distribution in the range [−0.11, −0.09]. The hidden bias has a mean of −0.1 to ensure stability of the system outputs. Inputs are generated by sampling T -length i.i.d. sequences of zero-mean, diagonal and unit covariance circular complexvalued Gaussians of dimension N . The outputs are created by running the system (1) forward on the inputs.</p><p>We compare a restricted-capacity uRNN using the parameterization from <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>  The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. "W sys init." refers to the initialization of the true system unitary matrix W sys , which is sampled from either the restricted-capacity set W u or the wider set W g . Notice that for N &lt; 7, the restricted-capacity uRNN achieves comparable or better performance than the full-capacity uRNN. At N = 7, the restricted-capacity and full-capacity uRNNs achieve relatively comparable performance, with the full-capacity uRNN achieving slightly lower error. For N &gt; 7, the full-capacity uRNN always achieves better performance versus the restricted-capacity uRNN. This result confirms our theoretical arguments that the restricted-capacity parameterization in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> lacks the capacity to model all matrices in the unitary group for N &gt; 7 and indicates the advantage of using a full-capacity unitary recurrence matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Copy memory problem</head><p>The experimental setup follows the copy memory problem from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which itself was based on the experiment from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We consider alternative hidden state dimensions and extend the sequence lengths to T = 1000 and T = 2000, which are longer than the maximum length of T = 750 considered in previous literature.</p><p>In this task, the data is a vector of length T + 20 and consists of elements from 10 categories. The vector begins with a sequence of 10 symbols sampled uniformly from categories 1 to 8. The next T − 1 elements of the vector are the ninth 'blank' category, followed by an element from the tenth category, the 'delimiter'. The remaining ten elements are 'blank'. The task is to output T + 10 blank characters followed by the sequence from the beginning of the vector. We use average cross entropy as the training loss function. The baseline solution outputs the blank category for T + 10 time steps and then guesses a random symbol uniformly from the first eight categories. This baseline has an expected average cross entropy of 10 log(8) T +20 .  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. The full-capacity uRNN hovers around the baseline solution for about 5000 training iterations, after which it drops down to zero average cross entropy. The restricted-capacity again settles down to the baseline solution of 0.010. These results demonstrate that the full-capacity uRNN is very effective for problems requiring very long memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Speech data</head><p>We now apply restricted-capacity and full-capacity uRNNs to real-world speech data and compare their performance to LSTMs. The main task we consider is predicting the log-magnitude of future frames of a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The STFT is a commonly used feature domain for speech enhancement, and is defined as the Fourier transform of short windowed frames of the time series. In the STFT domain, a real-valued audio signal is represented as a complex-valued F × T matrix composed of T frames that are each composed of F = N win /2 + 1 frequency bins, where N win is the duration of the time-domain frame. Most speech processing algorithms use the log-magnitude of the complex STFT values and reconstruct the processed audio signal using the phase of the original observations.</p><p>The frame prediction task is as follows: given all the log-magnitudes of STFT frames up to time t, predict the log-magnitude of the STFT frame at time t + 1.We use the TIMIT dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. According to common practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we use a training set with 3690 utterances from 462 speakers, a validation set of 400 utterances, an evaluation set of 192 utterances. Training, validation, and evaluation sets have distinct speakers. Results are reported on the evaluation set using the network parameters that perform best on the validation set in terms of the loss function over three training trials. All TIMIT audio is resampled to 8kHz. The STFT uses a Hann analysis window of 256 samples (32 milliseconds) and a window hop of 128 samples (16 milliseconds).</p><p>The LSTM requires gradient clipping during optimization, while the restricted-capacity and fullcapacity uRNNs do not. The hidden state dimensions N of the LSTM are chosen to match the number of parameters of the full-capacity uRNN. For the restricted-capacity uRNN, we run models that match either N or number of parameters. For the LSTM and restricted-capacity uRNNs, we use RMSprop <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with a learning rate of 0.001, momentum 0.9, and averaging parameter 0.1. For the full-capacity uRNN, we also use RMSprop to optimize all network parameters, except for the recurrence matrix, for which we use stochastic gradient descent along the Stiefel manifold using the update (6) with a fixed learning rate of 0.001 and no gradient normalization. Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows example predictions of the three types of networks. Results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> are given in terms of the mean-squared error (MSE) loss function and several metrics computed on the time-domain signals, which are reconstructed from the predicted log-magnitude <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Ground truth and one-frame-ahead predictions of a spectrogram for an example utterance. For each model, hidden state dimension N is chosen for the best validation MSE. Notice that the full-capacity uRNN achieves the best detail in its predictions. and the original phase of the STFT. These time-domain metrics are segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SegSNR), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). SegSNR, computed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, uses a voice activity detector to avoid measuring SNR in silent frames. STOI is designed to correlate well with human intelligibility of speech, and takes on values between 0 and 1, with a higher score indicating higher intelligibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. PESQ is the ITU-T standard for telephone voice quality testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, and is a popular perceptual quality metric for speech enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. PESQ ranges from 1 (bad quality) to 4.5 (no distortion).</p><p>Note that full-capacity uRNNs generally perform better than restricted-capacity uRNNs with the same number of parameters, and both types of uRNN significantly outperform LSTMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Pixel-by-pixel MNIST</head><p>As another challenging long-term memory task with natural data, we test the performance of LSTMs and uRNNs on pixel-by-pixel MNIST and permuted pixel-by-pixel MNIST, first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to test restricted-capacity uRNNs. For permuted pixel-by-pixel MNIST, the pixels are shuffled, thereby creating some non-local dependencies between pixels in an image. Since the MNIST images are 28 × 28 pixels, resulting pixel-by-pixel sequences are T = 784 elements long. We use 5000 of the 60000 training examples as a validation set to perform early stopping with a patience of 5. The loss function is cross-entropy. Weights with the best validation loss are used to process the evaluation set. The full-capacity uRNN uses RMSprop-style gradient normalization.  Learning curves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, and a summary of classification accuracies is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  3</ref>. For the unpermuted task, the LSTM with N = 256 achieves the best evaluation accuracy of 98.2%. For the permuted task, the full-capacity uRNN with N = 512 achieves the best evaluation accuracy of 94.1%, which is state-of-the-art on this task. Both uRNNs outperform LSTMs on the permuted case, achieving their best performance after fewer traing epochs and using an equal or lesser number of trainable parameters. This performance difference suggests that LSTMs are only able to model local dependencies, while uRNNs have superior long-term memory capabilities. Despite not representing all unitary matrices, the restricted-capacity uRNN with N = 512 still achieves impressive test accuracy of 93.3% with only 1/16 of the trainable parameters, outperforming the full-capacity uRNN with N = 116 that matches number of parameters. This result suggests that further exploration into the potential trade-off between hidden state dimension N and capacity of unitary parameterizations is necessary.</p></div>

The full-capacity uRNN converges quickly to a perfect solution, while the LSTM and restrictedcapacity uRNN with approximately the same number of parameters are unable to improve past the baseline naive solution.The full-capacity uRNN uses a hidden state size of N = 128 with no gradient normalization. To match the number of parameters (≈ 22k), we use N = 470 for the restricted-capacity uRNN, and N = 68 for the LSTM. The training set size is 100000 and the test set size is 10000. The results of the T = 1000 experiment can be found on the left half ofFigure 1. The full-capacity uRNN converges to a solution with zero average cross entropy after about 2000 training iterations, whereas the restricted-capacity uRNN settles to the baseline solution of 0.020. The results of the T = 2000 experiment can be found on the right half of</figDesc></figure>
