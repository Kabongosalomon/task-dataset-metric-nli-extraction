				<p>In this paper, we propose a new rich resource enhanced AMR aligner which produces multiple alignments and a new transition system for AMR parsing along with its oracle parser. Our aligner is further tuned by our oracle parser via picking the alignment that leads to the highest-scored achievable AMR graph. Experimental results show that our aligner outperforms the rule-based aligner in previous work by achieving higher alignment F1 score and consistently improving two open-sourced AMR parsers. Based on our aligner and transition system, we develop a transition-based AMR parser that parses a sentence into its AMR graph directly. An ensemble of our parsers with only words and POS tags as input leads to 68.4 Smatch F1 score, which outperforms the parser of Wang and Xue (2017).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) ( <ref type="bibr">Ba- narescu et al., 2013</ref>) is a semantic representation which encodes the meaning of a sentence in a rooted and directed graph, whose nodes are abstract semantic concepts and edges are semantic relations between concepts (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for an example). Parsing a sentence into its AMR graph has drawn a lot of research attention in recent years with a number of parsers being developed <ref type="bibr">(Flani- gan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pust et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artzi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Damonte et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Foland and Martin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konstas et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The nature of abstracting away the association between a concept and a span of words complicates the training of the AMR parser. A wordconcept aligner is required to derive such association from the sentence-AMR-graph pair and the * * Email corresponding. alignment precision. The JAMR aligner adopts a rule that aligns the word-concept pair which at least have a common longest prefix of 4 characters, but omitting the shorter cases like aligning the word "actions" to the concept act-01 and the semantically matched cases like aligning the word "example" to the concept exemplify-01.</p><p>The final challenge which is faced by both the rule-based and unsupervised aligners is tuning the alignment with downstream parser learning. Previous works treated the alignment as a fixed input. Its quality is never evaluated and its alternatives are never explored. All these challenges make the JAMR aligner achieve only an alignment F1 score of about 90% and influence the performance of the trained AMR parsers. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve these challenges and improve the word-toconcept alignment, which further improves the AMR parsing performance. A rule-based aligner and a transition-based oracle AMR parser lie in the core of our method. For the aligner part, we incorporate rich semantic resources into the JAMR aligner to recall more word-concept pairs and cancel its greedily aligning process. This leads to multiple alignment outputs with higher recall but lower precision. For the parser part, we propose a new transition system that can parse the raw sentence into AMR graph directly. Meanwhile, a new oracle algorithm is proposed which produces the best achievable AMR graph from an alignment. Our aligner is tuned by our oracle parser by feeding the alignments to the oracle parser and picking the one which leads to the highest Smatch F1 score . The chosen alignment is used in downstream training of the AMR parser. Based on the newly proposed aligner and transition system, we develop a transition-based parser that directly parses a sentence into its AMR graph and it can be easily improved through ensemble thanks to its simplicity.</p><p>We conduct experiments on LDC2014T12 dataset. 1 Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations are performed on our aligner. In the intrinsic evaluation, our aligner achieves an alignment F1 score of 95.2%. In the extrinsic evaluation, we replace the JAMR aligner with ours in two opensourced AMR parsers, which leads to consistent improvements on both parsers. We also evaluate our transition-based parser on the same dataset.</p><p>1 catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2014t12</p><p>Using both our aligner and ensemble, a score of 68.1 Smatch F1 is achieved without any additional resources, which is comparable to the parser of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue (2017)</ref>. With additional part-ofspeech (POS) tags, our ensemble parser achieves 68.4 Smatch F1 score and outperforms that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The contributions of this paper come in two folds:</p><p>• We propose a new AMR aligner ( §3) which recalls more semantically matched pairs and produces multiple alignments. We also propose a new transition system for AMR parsing ( §4.1) and use its oracle ( §4.2) to pick the alignment that leads to the highest-scored achievable AMR graph ( §4.3). Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations ( §5) show the effectiveness of our aligner by achieving higher F1 score and consistently improving two opensourced AMR parsers.</p><p>• We build a new transition-based parser ( §4.4) upon our aligner and transition system which directly parses a raw sentence into its AMR graph. Through simple ensemble, our parser achieves 68.4 Smatch F1 score with only words and POS tags as input ( §6) and outperforms the parser of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Our code and the alignments for LDC2014T12 dataset are publicly available at https:// github.com/Oneplus/tamr 2 Related Work AMR Parsers. AMR parsing maps a natural language sentence into its AMR graph. Most current parsers construct the AMR graph in a two-staged manner which first identifies concepts (nodes in the graph) from the input sentence, then identifies relations (edges in the graph) between the identified concepts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al. (2014)</ref> and their follow-up works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flanigan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</ref>) model the parsing problem as finding the maximum spanning connected graph. <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2015b)</ref> proposes to greedily transduce the dependency tree into AMR graph and a bunch of works ( <ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue, 2017)</ref> further improve the transducer's performance with rich features and imitation learning. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Transition-based methods that directly parse an input sentence into its AMR graph have also been studied ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballesteros and Al- Onaizan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Damonte et al., 2017)</ref>. In these works, the concept identification and relation identification are performed jointly.</p><p>An aligner which maps a span of words into its concept serves to the generation of training data for the concept identifier, thus is important to the parser training. Missing or incorrect alignments lead to poor concept identification, which then hurt the overall AMR parsing performance. Besides the typical two-staged methods, the aligner also works in some other AMR parsing algorithms like that using syntax-based machine translation <ref type="bibr">(Pust et al., 2015)</ref>, sequence-to-sequence ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Peng et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Konstas et al., 2017)</ref>, Hyperedge Replacement <ref type="bibr">Grammar (Peng et al., 2015)</ref> and Combinatory Category Grammar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artzi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Previous aligner works solve the alignment problem in two different ways. The rule-based aligner <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Flanigan et al., 2014</ref>) defines a set of heuristic rules which align a span of words to the graph fragment and greedily applies these rules. The unsupervised aligner ( <ref type="bibr">Pourdamghani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue, 2017)</ref> uncovers the word-toconcept alignment from the linearized AMR graph through EM. All these approaches yield a single alignment for one sentence and its effect on the downstream parsing is not considered. JAMR Aligner ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al., 2014</ref>). Two components exist in the JAMR aligner: 1) a set of heuristic rules and 2) a greedy search process.</p><p>The heuristic rules in the JAMR aligner are a set of indicator functions ρ(c, w s,e ) which take a concept c and a span of words w s,e starting from s and ending with e as input and return whether they should be aligned. These rules can be categorized into matching rules and updating rules. The matching rules directly compare c with w s,e and determine if they should be aligned. The updating rules first retrieve the concept c that w s,e aligns, then determine if c and w s,e should be aligned by checking whether c and c meet some conditions. Here, we illustrate how update rules work by applying a rule named Entity Type on the AMR graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> as an example. When determining if the entity type concept country should be aligned to "North Korea", the Entity tinguish their work with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Damonte et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017)</ref>, we use the term "transduce" instead.</p><p>Type rule first retrieve that this span is aligned to the fragment (name :op1 "North" :op2 "Korea"), then determine if they are aligned by checking if name is the tail concept of country.</p><p>The greedy search process applies rules in a manually defined order. The results are mutually exclusive which means once a graph fragment is aligned by one rule, it cannot be realigned. By doing so, conflicts between the alignments produced by different rules are resolved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al. (2014)</ref> didn't talk about the principle of orders but it generally follows the principle that 1) the matching rules have higher priorities than the updating rules, and 2) exact matching rules have higher priorities than the fuzzy matching rules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources</head><p>Error propagates in the greedy search process. An alignment error can lead to future errors because of the dependencies and mutual exclusions between rules. In the JAMR aligner, rules that recall more alignments but introduce errors are carefully opted out and it influences the aligner's performance. Our motivation is to use rich semantic resources to recall more alignments. Instead of resolving the resulted conflicts and errors by greedy search, we keep the multiple alignments produced by the aligner and let a parser decide the best alignment.</p><p>In this paper, we use two kinds of semantic resources to recall more alignments, which include the similarity drawn from Glove embedding <ref type="bibr">(Pen- nington et al., 2014)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and the morphosemantic database <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fellbaum et al., 2009</ref>) in the WordNet project <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Two additional matching schemes semantic match and morphological match are proposed as:</p><p>Semantic Match. Glove embedding encodes a word into its vector representation. We define semantic match of a concept as a word in the sentence that has a cosine similarity greater than 0.7 in the embedding space with the concept striping off trailing number (e.g. run-01 → run).</p><p>Morphological Match. Morphosemantic is a database that contains links among derivational (Semantic Named Entity) Applies to name concepts and their opn children. Matches a span that matches the semantic match of each child in numerical order. (Morphological Named Entity) Applies to name concepts and their opn children. Matches a span that matches the morphological match of each child in numerical order. (Semantic Concept) Applies to any concept. Strips off trailing '-[0-9]+' from the concept, and matches any semantic matching word. (Morphological Concept) Applies to any concept. Strips off trailing '-[0-9]+' from the concept, and matches any morphological matching word or WordNet lemma. links connecting noun and verb senses (e.g., "example" and exemplify). We define morphological match of a concept as a word in the sentence having the (word, concept) link in the database.</p><p>By defining the semantic match and morphological match, we extend the rules in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al. (2014)</ref> with four additional matching rules as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. These rules are intended to recall the concepts or entities which either semantically resemble a span of words but differ in the surface form, or match a span of words in their morphological derivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Producing Multiple Alignments</head><p>Using the rules in the JAMR aligner along with our four extended matching rules, we propose an algorithm to draw multiple alignments from a pair of sentence and AMR graph and it is shown in Algorithm 1. In this algorithm, A c denotes the set of candidate alignments for a graph fragment c, in which each alignment is represented as a tuple (s, e, c ) where s denotes the starting position, e denotes the ending position, and c denotes the concept that lead to this alignment. At the beginning, A c is initialized as an empty set (line 1 to 2). Then all the matching rules are tried to align a span of words to that fragment (line 3 to 7). After applying all the matching rules, all the updating rules are repeatedly applied until no new alignment is generated in one iteration (line 8 to 16). During applying the updating rules, we keep track of the dependencies between fragments. Finally, all the possible combination of the alignments are enumerated without considering the one that violates the fragment dependencies (line 17 to 26).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Transition-based AMR Parser</head><p>Our enhanced rule-based aligner produces multiple alignments, and we would like to use our Algorithm 1: Our alignment algorithm.</p></div>

A deterministic parser works in this situation but is required to consider the association between concepts and spans. This stops the deterministic parsers which build AMR graph only from the derived concepts 5 from being used because they do not distinguish alignments that yields to the same set of concepts. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This discussion shows that to evaluate the quality of an alignment, we need a deterministic (oracle) parser which builds the AMR graph from the raw sentence. Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) presented a transition-based parser that directly parses a sentence into its AMR graph. A transition system which extends the swap-based dependency parsing system to handle AMR non-projectivities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Damonte et al., 2017</ref>) was proposed in their work.</p></div>

Their extension to transition-based AMR parsing is worth studying. In this paper, we propose to extend Choi and McCallum (2013)'s transition system to AMR parsing and present the corresponding oracle parser. The oracle parser is used for tuning our aligner and training our parser.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">List-based Extension for AMR Parsing</head><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi and McCallum (2013)</ref> and define a state in our transition system as a quadruple s = (σ, δ, β, A), where σ is a stack holding processed words, δ is a deque holding words popped out of σ that will be pushed back in the future, and β is a buffer holding unprocessed words. A is a set of labeled relations. A set of actions is defined to parse sentence into AMR graph. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> gives a formal illustration of these actions and how they work. The first five actions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> are our extended actions, and they are used to deriving concepts from the input sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Oracle Parser</head><p>Given an alignment and the gold standard AMR graph, we can build the best AMR graph by repeatedly applying one of these actions and this is what we called oracle parser. Before running the oracle parser, we first remove the concepts which aren't aligned with any span of words from the AMR graph. During running the oracle parser, for a state s = (σ|s 0 , δ, b 0 |b 1 |β, A), our oracle parser decides which action to apply by checking the following conditions one by one.</p><p>1. If b 0 is a word and it doesn't align to any concept, perform DROP.</p><p>2. If b 1 is within a span in the alignment, perform MERGE.</p><p>3. If b 0 is a word or span and it only aligns to one entity concept c, perform ENTITY(c).    9. perform SHIFT.</p><p>We test our oracle parser on the hand-align data created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flanigan et al. (2014)</ref> and it achieves 97.4 Smatch F1 score. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Besides the errors resulted from incorrect manual alignments, entity errors made by the limitation of our ENTITY(c) action count a lot. Since our ENTITY action directly converts the surface form of a word span into an entity. It cannot correctly generate entity names when they require derivation, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> or where tokenization errors exist. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Tune the Aligner with Oracle Parser</head><p>Using our oracle parser, we tune the aligner by picking the alignment which leads to the highestscored AMR graph from the set of candidates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref> for the workflow). When more than one alignment achieve the highest score, we choose the one with the smallest number of actions. Intuitively, choosing the one with the smallest number of actions will encourage structurally coherent alignment 10 because coherent alignment requires fewer CACHE actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parsing Model</head><p>Based on our aligner and transition system, we propose a transition-based parser which parse the <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Since some alignments in hand-align were created on incorrect AMR annotations, we filter out them and only use the correct subset which has 136 pairs of alignment and AMR graph. This data is also used in our intrinsic evaluation. 8 e.g., "North Koreans" cannot be parsed into (name :op1 "North" :op2 "Korea") 9 e.g., "Wi Sung -lac" cannot be parsed into (name :op1 "Wi" :op2 "Sung-lac") 10 e.g. the first "nuclear" aligned to nucleus˜1nucleus˜nucleus˜1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> raw sentence directly into its AMR graph. In this paper, we follow Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) and use StackLSTM ( ) to model the states. The score of a transition action a on state s is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p(a|s) = exp{g a · STACKLSTM(s) + b a } a exp{g a · STACKLSTM(s) + b a } ,</formula><p>where STACKLSTM(s) encodes the state s into a vector and g a is the embedding vector of action a.</p><p>We encourage the reader to refer Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) for more details.</p><p>Ensemble. Ensemble has been shown as an effective way of improving the neural model's performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">He et al., 2017)</ref>. Since the transitionbased parser directly parse a sentence into its AMR graph, ensemble of several parsers is easier compared to the two-staged AMR parsers. In this paper, we ensemble the parsers trained with different initialization by averaging their probability distribution over the actions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Ablation</head><p>To have a better understanding of our aligner, we conduct ablation test by removing the semantic matching and oracle parser tuning respectively and retrain the JAMR parser on the newswire proportion. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. From this table, we can see that removing either of these components harms the performance. Removing oracle parser tuning leads to severe performance drop and the score is even lower than that with JAMR aligner. We address this observation to that alignment noise is introduced by the semantic matching especially by the word embedding similarity component. Without filtering the noise by our oracle parser, just introducing more matching rules will harm the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Parsing Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Settings</head><p>We use the same settings in our aligner extrinsic evaluation for the experiments on our transitionbased parser. For the input to the parser, we tried two settings: 1) using only words as input, and 2) using words and POS tags as input. Automatic POS tags are assigned with Stanford POS tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Manning et al., 2014</ref>). Word embedding from  is used in the same way with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017)</ref>. To opt model newswire JAMR parser + Our aligner 73.1 -Semantic matching 72.7 -Oracle Parser Tuning 67.6 JAMR parser + JAMR aligner 71.3 out the effect of different initialization in training the neural network, we run 10 differently seeded runs and report their average performance following Reimers and Gurevych (2017). <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows the performance of our transitionbased parser along with comparison to the parsers in the previous works. When compared with our transition-based counterpart (Ballesteros and AlOnaizan, 2017), our word-only model outperforms theirs using the same JAMR alignment. The same trend is witnessed using words and POS tags as input. When replacing the JAMR alignments with ours, the parsing performances are improved in the same way as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, which further confirms the effectiveness of our aligner. The second block in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows the results of our ensemble parser, in which ensemble significantly improves the performance and more parsers ensembled, more improvements are achieved. An ensemble of 10 parsers with only words as input achieves 68.1 Smatch F1 score which is comparable to the AMR parser of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue (2017)</ref>. Using the minimal amount of additional syntactic information -POS tags, the performance of the ensemble of 10 parsers is further pushed to 68.4, which surpasses that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wang and Xue (2017)</ref> which relied on named entity recognition (NER) and dependency parsing (DEP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>A further study on the speed shows that our 10 parser ensemble can parse 43 tokens per second which is faster than JAMR (7 tokens/sec.) and CAMR (24 tokens/sec.) thanks to the simplicity of our model and independence of preprocessing, like NER and DEP. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Comparison to Ballesteros and</head><p>Al-Onaizan (2017)</p><p>To explain the improved performance against Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) in  give a comprehensive comparison between our transition system and that of Ballesteros and AlOnaizan (2017).</p><p>Capability. In both these two systems, a span of words can only be derived into concept for one time. "Patch" actions are required to generate new concepts from the one that is aligned to the same span. 12 Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) uses a DEPENDENT action to generate one tail concept for one hop and cannot deal with the cases which have a chain of more than two concepts aligned to the same span. Our list-based system differs theirs by using a NEW action to deal these cases. Since the new concept is pushed onto the buffer, NEW action can be repeatedly applied and used to generate arbitrary concepts that aligned to the same span. On the development set of LDC2014T12, our oracle achieves 91.7 Smatch F1 score over the JAMR alignment, which outperforms Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017)'s oracle (89.5 in their paper) on the same alignment. This result confirms that our list-based system is more powerful.</p><p>Number of Actions. Our list-based system also differs theirs in the number of oracle actions required to parse the same AMR graphs. We use the oracles from two systems to parse the development set of LDC2014T12 on the same JAMR alignments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3</ref> shows the comparison in which our system clearly uses fewer actions (the average number of our system is 63.7 and that of Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) is 86.4). Using fewer actions makes the parser learned from the oracle less prone to error propagation. We attribute the improved performance in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> to this advantage of transition system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a new AMR aligner which is tuned by a novel transition-based AMR oracle parser. Our aligner is also enhanced by rich semantic resource and recalls more alignments. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show the effectiveness of our aligner by achieving higher alignment F1 score and consistently improving two open-sourced AMR parsers. We also develop transition-based AMR parser based on our aligner and transition system and it achieves a performance of 68.4 Smatch F1 score via ensemble with only words and POS tags as input.</p><p>supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China via grant 2014CB340503 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) via grant 61632011 and 61772153.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: AMR graph for the sentence "North Korea froze its nuclear actions in exchange for two nuclear reactors."</figDesc></figure>
