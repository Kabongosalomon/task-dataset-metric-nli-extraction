<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Neural networks trained on datasets such as ImageNet have led to major advances in visual object classification. One obstacle that prevents networks from reasoning more deeply about complex scenes and situations, and from integrating visual knowledge with natural language, like humans do, is their lack of common sense knowledge about the physical world. Videos, unlike still images, contain a wealth of detailed information about the physical world. However, most labelled video datasets represent high-level concepts rather than detailed physical aspects about actions and scenes. In this work, we describe our ongoing collection of the "something-something" database of video prediction tasks whose solutions require a common sense understanding of the depicted situation. The database currently contains more than 100,000 videos across 174 classes, which are defined as caption-templates. We also describe the challenges in crowd-sourcing this data at scale.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Datasets and challenges like ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have been major contributors to the recent dramatic improvements in neural network based object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8]</ref>, as well as to improvements on a variety of other vision tasks thanks to transfer learning (eg., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>).</p><p>Despite their representational power, neural networks trained on still image datasets fall short of a variety of visual <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: An example video, captioned "Picking [something] up", taken from our growing database. Crowdworkers are asked to record videos and to complete captiontemplates, by providing appropriate input-text for placeholders. In this example, the text provided for placeholder "something" is a shoe. We plan to increase the complexity and sophistication of caption-templates over time, to the degree that models succeed at making predictions.</p><p>capabilities, some of which are likely to be resolvable using video instead of still image data. Specifically, networks trained to predict object classes from still images never observe any changes of objects, like changes in pose, position or distance from the observer. However, such changes provide important cues about object properties. Multiple different views of a rigid object or scene, for example, provide information about 3-D geometry (and it is common practice in computer vision to extract that information from multiple views <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the 3-D structure of a rigid object, the very fact that an object is rigid itself can be extracted from multiple views of the object in motion, as well as the fact that an object is, say, articulated as opposed to rigid. Similarly, material properties such as various forms of deformability, elasticity, softness, stiffness, etc. express themselves visually through deformation cues encoded in multiple views.</p><p>Closely related to material properties is the notion of affordance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9]</ref>: An object can, by virtue of its properties, be used to perform certain actions, and often this usability is more important than its "true" inherent object class (which may itself be considered a questionable concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>). For example, an object that is soft and deformable, such as a blanket, can be used to cover another object; an object that is sharp and pointy can be used poke a hole into something; etc. It seems unlikely that still image tasks, which encode object properties only indirectly, can provide significant mileage in improving a neural network's understanding of affordances. The same holds true to other physical concepts that we humans intuitively grasp, like understanding that unsupported objects will fall (gravity) or that hidden objects do not cease to exist (object occlusion/permanence).</p><p>Motion patterns extracted from a video are not only capable of revealing object properties but also of revealing actions and activities. Not surprisingly, most of the currently popular labeled video datasets are action recognition datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11]</ref>. It is important to note, however, that in a fine-grained understanding of visual concepts that goes beyond "one-of-K"-labeling, actions and objects are naturally intertwined, and the tasks of predicting one cannot be treated independently of predicting the other. For example, the phrase "opening NOUN" will have drastically different visual counterparts, depending on whether "NOUN" in this phrase is replaced by "door", "zipper", "blinds", "bag", or "mouth". There are also commonalities between these instances of "opening", like the fact that parts are moved to the sides giving way to what is behind. It is, of course, exactly these commonalities which define the concept of "opening". So a true understanding of the underlying meaning of the action word "opening" would require the ability to generalize across these different use cases. A proper understanding of such concepts is closely related to affordances. For example, the fact that a door can be opened is much more likely to be taken into consideration, or even learnable by a robot (which is, say, searching for an object), if its feature space is already structured such that it can distinguish between opening and closing doors.</p><p>Not only words for objects and actions can be grounded in the visual world, but also many abstract concepts, because these are built by means of analogy on top of the more basic, every-day concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9]</ref>. The importance of grounding for language understanding is reflected in Winograd schemas <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, which are linguistic puzzles whose solutions require common sense. A Winograd schema is given by two sentences, the second of which refers to the first in a superficially ambiguous way, but where the ambiguity can be resolved by common sense. Consider the following Winograd schema presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>: "The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big. What was too big?" To answer this question, it is necessary to understand basic aspects of spatial relations and properties (like sizes), of objects, as well as the activity of putting an object into another. This makes it clear that text understanding from pure text may have its limitations, and that visual (or possibly tactile) grounding may be an inevitable step in seriously advancing language understanding.</p><p>In this work, we describe our efforts in generating the "something something"-database, whose purpose is to provide visual (and partially acoustic) counterparts of simple, everyday aspects of the world. The goal of this data is to encourage networks to develop the features required for making predictions which, by definition, involve certain aspects of common sense information. The database 1 currently contains 108, 499 short video clips (with duration ∈ [2, 6] seconds), that are labeled with simple textual descriptions. The videos show objects and actions performed on them. Labels are in textual form and represent detailed information about the objects and actions as well as other relevant information. Predicting the textual labels from the videos requires features that are capable of representing physical properties of the objects and the world, such as spatial relations or material properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>There has been an increasing interest recently in learning representations of physical aspects of the world using neural networks. Such representations are commonly referred to as intuitive or naive physics to contrast them with the symbolic/mathematical descriptions of the world developed in physics. Several recent papers address learning intuitive physics by using physical interactions (robotics) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. A shortcoming of this line of work is that it is based on using still images, which show, for example, how objects appear before and after performing a certain action. Physical predictions are made using convolutional networks applied to the images. Any sequential information is thus reduced to predicting a causal relationship between action and observations in a single feedforward computation, and any information encoded in the motion itself is lost.</p><p>Some recent work has been devoted to the goal of learning about the world using video instead of robotics. For ex-ample, there has been a long-standing endeavor to use future frames of a video as "free" labels for supervised training of neural networks. See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref> and references therein. The fact that multiple images can reveal qualitatively different information on top of still images has been well-established for many years in both the computer vision and deep learning communities, and it has been exploited in the context of deep learning largely by using bilinear models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> and references therein). Unfortunately, predicting raw pixels is challenging, both for computational and for statistical reasons. There are simply a lot of aspects of the real world that a predictor of raw pixels has to account for. This may be one reason why unsupervised learning through video prediction has hitherto not "taken off".</p><p>One way to address the difficulty of predicting raw pixels is to re-define the task to predict high-level features of future frames. In order to obtain features one can, for example, first train a neural network on still image object-recognition tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref>. However, a potential problem with that approach is that the purpose of using video in the first place is the creation of features that capture information beyond the information already contained in still images. Also, predicting ImageNet-features has not shown yet to yield features that add substantially more information about the physical world.</p><p>A hybrid between learning from video and learning from interactions is the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> who use a game engine to render block towers that collapse. A convolutional network is then trained to predict, using an image of the tower as input, whether it will collapse or not, as well as the trajectories of parts while the tower collapses. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>, predictions are based on still images not videos.</p><p>A line of work more similar to ours is Yatskar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref>, who introduced a dataset of images associated with finegrained labels by associating roles with actions and objects. In contrast to our work, the labels in that work describe sophisticated, cultural concepts, such as "clipping a sheep's wool". Our goal in this work is to capture basic physical concepts expressible in simple phrases, which we hope will provide a stepping stone towards more complex relationships and facts. Consequently, we use natural language instead of a fixed data structure to represent labels. More importantly, our starting point towards fine-grained understanding is videos not images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Learning world models from video</head><p>Although images still largely dominate research in visual deep learning, a variety of sizeable labeled video datasets have been introduced in recent years. The dominant application domain so far has been action recognition, where the task is to predict a global action label for a given video (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5]</ref>). A drawback of action recognition is that it is targeted at fairly high-level aspects of videos and therefore does not encourage a network to learn about motion primitives that can encode object properties and intuitive physics. For example, the task associated with the datasets described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11]</ref> is recognizing sports, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> they include high-level, human-centered activities, such as "getting out of a car" or "fighting".</p><p>A related problem is that these tasks amount to taking a long video sequence as input and producing one out of a relatively small number of global class-labels as the output. Rather than requiring a detailed understanding of what happens in a video, these datasets require features that can condense a long sequence (usually including many scene and perspective changes) into a single label. In many cases, labels can be predicted fairly accurately even from a single image cropped from the video. As a result, good classification performance can be achieved on these tasks by framewise aggregation of features extracted with a convolutional network that was pre-trained on a still image task, such as ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39]</ref>. This is in stark contrast to the goal of using video in order to learn a better world model. One prerequisite for learning more fine-grained information about the world is that labels describe video content that is restricted to a short time interval. Only this way can there be a tight synchronization between video content and the corresponding labels, allowing learned features to correspond to physical aspects of the unfolding scene, and to correlate with the low-level aspects that are reflected, for example, also in everyday language.</p><p>Detailed labeling has been addressed also in various video captioning datasets recently, where the goal is to predict an elaborate description, rather than a single label, for a video <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12]</ref>. However, similar to many of the action recognition datasets mentioned above, they typically contain descriptions that reflect high-level, cultural aspects of human life and commonly require a good knowledge of rare or unusual facts and language. Furthermore, since descriptions summarize fairly long videos, they do not have a high temporal resolution.</p><p>A dataset focussing on lower-level, more physical concepts is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref>. The dataset contains 17, 408 videos of a small set of objects involved in a number of physical experiments. These include, for example, letting the object slide down a slope or dropping it onto a surface. The supervision signal is given by (known) physical properties of the experiment, such as the angle of the slope or the material of the object. In contrast to that work, besides scaling to a much larger size, we use language as labels, similar to captioning datasets. This allows us to generate a much larger and more varied set of actions and labels. It also allows us to go beyond a small and highly specialized set of physical properties and actions prescribed by the experimental setup and by what can easily be measured.</p><p>Many shortcomings of existing video datasets may be re- <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Comparison with other video datasets recorded specifically for training machine learning models (information partially taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>).</p></div>

Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> proposed a way to overcome this problem by asking crowdworkers to record videos themselves rather than to attach labels to existing videos. In this work, we follow a similar approach using a scalable framework for crowd-sourced video recording. Using our large-scale crowd acting TM framework, we have so far generated several hundred thousand videos, including the dataset discussed in this paper. In contrast to the dataset described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref> we focus here on basic, physical concepts rather than on higher-level human activities.</p><p>A comparison with existing similar datasets is shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> 4. The "something-something" dataset</p><p>In this work, we introduce the "something-something"dataset. It currently contains 108, 499 videos across 174 labels, with duration ranging from 2 to 6 seconds. Labels are textual descriptions based on templates, such as "Dropping [something] into [something]" containing slots ("[something]") that serve as placeholders for objects. Crowdworkers provide videos where they act out the templates. They choose the objects to perform the actions on and enter the noun-phrase describing the objects when uploading the videos.</p><p>The dataset is split into train, validation and test-sets in the ratio of 8:1:1. The splits were created so as to ensure that all videos provided by the same worker occur only in one split (train, validation, or test). See <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> for some summary information about the dataset.</p><p>Including differences in case, stemming, use of determiners, etc., 23, 137 distinct object names have been submitted in the current version of the dataset. We estimate the number of actually distinct objects to be at least a few thousand. <ref type="figure">Figure 3b</ref> shows the frequency of objects for the most common objects.</p><p>In its current version, the dataset was generated by 1133 crowd workers with an average of 127.32 workers per class.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Crowdsourced video recording</head><p>The currently pre-dominant way of creating large, labeled datasets is to start by gathering a large collection of input items, such as images or videos. Usually, these are found using online resources, such as Google image search or Youtube. Subsequently, the gathered input examples are labeled using crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</p><p>As outlined is Section 3 videos available online are largely unsuitable for the goal of learning simple (but finegrained) visual concepts. We therefore ask crowd-workers to provide videos given labels instead of the other way around (a similar approach was recently described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Natural language labels and curriculum learning</head><p>The number of "everyday concepts" that we want to capture with this dataset is gigantic, and it cannot be captured within a fixed set of one-hot labels. Natural language descriptions are a natural and obvious solution to this problem: natural language is capable of representing an extremely large number of "classes" and it is compositional and thereby able to express this number highly economi-  Unfortunately, natural language provides a much weaker learning signal than a one-hot label. This is one reason why image and video captioning systems are currently trained using an ImageNet pre-trained network as the vision component.</p><p>To obtain useful natural-language labels, but also be able to train, and potentially bootstrap, networks to learn from the data, we generate natural language descriptions automatically by appropriately combining partly pre-defined, and partly human-generated, parts of speech. Natural language descriptions take the form of templates that AMT workers provide along with videos, as we shall describe in the next section. Analogous to how probabilistic graphical Putting a white remote into a cardboard box Pretending to put candy onto chair</p><p>Pushing a green chilli so that it falls off the table</p><p>Moving puncher closer to scissor models impose independence assumptions on a multivariate distribution, these "structured captions", can be viewed as approximations to full natural language descriptions, that allow us to control the complexity of learning by imposing a rich (but restricted) structure on the labels.</p><p>In the current version of the dataset, we emphasize short and simple descriptions, most of which contain only the most important parts of speech, such as verbs, nouns and prepositions. This choice was made, because common neural networks are not yet able to represent elaborate captions and high-level concepts.</p><p>However, it is possible to increase the degree of complexity as well as the sophistication of language over time as the dataset grows. This approach can be viewed as "curriculum learning" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where simple concepts are taught first, and more complicated concepts are added progressively over time. From this perspective, the level of complexity of the current version of the dataset may be viewed approximately as "teaching a one-year-old child". Unlike labels that are encoded using a fixed datatype, as described, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41]</ref>, natural language labels allow us to represent a spectrum of complexity, from simple objects and actions encoded as one-hot labels, to full-fledged captions. The use of natural language encodings for classes furthermore allows us to dynamically adjust the label structure in response to how learning progresses. In other words, the complexity of videos and natural language descriptions can be increased as a function of the validation-accuracy achievable by networks trained on the data so far.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Non-uniform sampling of the Cartesian product of actions and objects</head><p>Although it is more restricted than captions, the cross product of actions and objects constitutes a space that is so large that there is no hope to sample it sufficiently densely as needed for practical applications. But the empirical prob-ability density of real-world cases in the space of permissible actions and objects is far from uniform. Many actions, such as "Moving an elephant on the table" or "Pouring paper from a cup", for example, have almost zero density. And more reasonable combinations can still have highly variable probabilities. Consider, for example, "drinking from a plastic bag" (highly rare) vs. "dropping a piece of paper" (highly common).</p><p>It is possible to exploit the low entropy of this distribution, by using the following sampling scheme: Each crowdworker is presented with an action in the form of a template that contains one or several placeholders for objects. Workers then get to decide which objects to perform the action on and generate a video clip. When uploading the video, workers are required to enter their object choice(s) into a provided mask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Grouping and contrastive examples</head><p>The goal of the "something-something" collection effort is to provide fine-grained discrimination tasks, whose solution will require a fairly deep understanding of the physical world. However, especially in the early stage, where simple descriptions focussed on verbs and nouns dominate, networks can learn to "cheat", for example, by extracting the object type from one or several individual frames, and by extracting the action using indirect cues, such as hand position, overall velocity, camera shake, etc. This is an example of dataset bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>.</p><p>As a way to reduce bias, by forcing networks to classify the actual actions and the underlying physics, we provide action groups for most action types. An action group contains multiple similar actions with minor visual differences, so that fine-grained understanding of the activity is required to distinguish the actions within a group. Providing action groups to the AMT workers also encourages these to perform the multiple different actions with the same object, such that a close attention to detail is required to correctly identify the action within the group. We found that action groups also serve the communication with crowdworkers in clarifying to them the kinds of fine-grained distinctions in the uploaded videos we expect.</p><p>Some groups contain pretending actions in addition to the actual action to be performed. This will require any system training on this data to closely observe the object instead of secondary cues such as hand positions. It will also require the networks to learn and represent indirect visual cues, such as the fact that an object is present or not present in a particular region in the image. Preventing a network from "cheating" by distinguishing between actual and pretended actions is reminiscent of teaching a child by asking it to tell the difference between genuine and false actions. Examples of action groups we use include: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Data collection platform</head><p>Besides the requirements outlined above, crowdsourcing the recording of video data according to a pre-defined label structure poses a variety of technical challenges:</p><p>• Batch submission: Crowd workers need to be able to initiate a job, and come back to it later potentially multiple times until it is completed, so that they can record videos outside or at other places or times of the day, or after having gathered the objects needed for the task. • Worker-conditional choice of labels: To generate data with sufficient variability, it is important that each label is represented by videos from as many different crowdworkers as possible. To this end, it is necessary to keep track of the set of labels recorded by each individual crowdworker. 'The list of labels or action groups (as defined below) to choose from can be generated dynamically once the crowdworker logs on to the platform. • Feedback on completed or partially completed submissions: In the case of submissions that are fully or partially rejected it is important that the crowd sourcing operators can quickly provide feedback to the crowd workers regarding what was wrong with the submission. • Convenience: To reduce cost, crowd workers need to face a convenient, easy-to-use and highly responsive interface.</p><p>To address these challenges, we created a data collection platform, with which both crowd workers and our operators overseeing the crowdsourcing efforts interact during the ongoing crowdsourcing operation. When an AMT crowdworker accepts a task on the AMT interface he/she gets re-directed to our platform, where the task is then completed and reviewed. After completion of a task, our platform communicates with AMT to communicate the result (accept/reject) and allow for payments for the accepted tasks.</p><p>On the platform, workers get presented with a list of action-templates to choose from (with action-templates grouped as described in the previous section). By selecting action-templates, the platform creates video uploadboxes where workers can upload the videos as required, along with label-templates with variable-roles to be filled by workers. After uploading a video, all variable-roles in the label template (represented by the word "something" in most of our label templates) turn into input masks, and the worker is asked to fill in the correct word (such as the noun describing the object used). Each uploaded video is displayed (as screenshot) in a video playback-box and it can be played back for easy inspection by the workers (as well as by the operators as we describe below). After the worker reaches the number of requested videos, a button "Submit Hit" gets released, that allows the worker to submit the assignment and get paid.</p><p>A submission is accepted automatically, if it passes a number of quality control checks, which verify aspects such as length and uniqueness of the videos. Every submission is subsequently verified for correctness by a human operator. For more details on the crowd acting platform and screenshots we refer to the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Baseline experiments</head><p>We performed a few baseline experiments to assess the difficulty of the task of predicting label templates from the videos. In this work, we discuss classification tasks on the label templates. Full captioning and performance on the expanded labels will be discussed elsewhere. On the classification tasks, we found 3d-convolutional networks to generally outperform 2d-convolutional networks and their combination to work best. But we also found that many of the subtle classes that were chosen explicitly to make the task harder (Section 4.4), are hardly distinguishable using these fairly standard architectures. More sophisticated architectures are necessary to obtain better performance on this data. A difficulty for both training and interpreting results is the presence of ambiguities in the labels. For reporting, these can be dealt with to some degree by resorting to top-K error rate. Both ambiguities and the overall difficulty of the prediction tasks can be alleviated by choosing label subsets and by combining labels into groups, which can allow fairly simple architectures to achieve reasonable performance. We shall discuss several such simplified subsets of classes below. We also found that this grouping can help as an initialization for networks that are subsequently fine-tuned on more complex class-choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Pre-processing</head><p>For the baseline runs, we sample frames from the videos using a frame rate of 24 fps and resize them to a resolution of 84 × 84 pixels, except for those runs where we use a pre-trained model (in which case we use the resolution is determined by that model). We lowpass-filter the resulting  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Subset of 10 hand-chosen "easy" classes. videos in time using a Gaussian kernel with zero mean and variance of 48 pixels, which was chosen to largely eliminate frequencies above the Nyquist-frequency, taking into consideration the target frame-rate of 6 frames per second (as discussed below).</p><p>We also perform temporal augmentation by choosing a random offset between 0 and the downsampling factor (4) during training. We use a fixed offset of 0 for validation and testing. We have also experimented with other types of data augmentation including flipping frames for invariant classes and random rotation by a small angle, but we did not find any significant performance gains for these.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Model specifications</head><p>Here we report results on the task of predicting action templates using multiple different encoding methods. We found dropout on the first fully-connected layer and batchnormalization on the last layer to significantly improve training. The encoding methods we used are:</p><p>2D-CNN + Avg: Using the VGG-16 net architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> to represent individual frames and averaging the obtained features for each frame in the video to form the final encoding. The weights of the network were trained from scratch.</p><p>Pre-2D-CNN + Avg: Using an Imagenet-trained VGG-16 architecture to represent individual frames and averaging the obtained features for each frame in the video to form the final encoding.</p><p>Pre-2D-CNN + LSTM: Using the above pre-trained VGG network to represent individual frames and passing the extracted features to an LSTM layer with a hidden state size of 256. The last hidden state of the LSTM is then taken as the video encoding.</p><p>3D-CNN + Stack: Using a 3D-CNN model trained from scratch with specifications following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref>, but with a size of 1024 units for the fully-connected layers and a clip size of 9 frames. We extract these features from non-overlapping clips of size 9 frames (after padding all videos to a maximal length of 36 frames), and stack the obtained features  to obtain a 4096 dimensional representation (4 columns), masking the column features, such that invalid frames (due to padding) do not affect training.</p><p>Pre-3D-CNN + Avg: Using a 3D-CNN model initialized on the sports-1m dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref> and finetuned on our dataset. In this case, we use the framerate 8 fps for training and extract columns of size 16 frames with 8 frames overlap between columns, such that the total number of columns is 5. We average the features across the clips.</p><p>2D+3D-CNN: A combination of the best performing 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN trained models, obtained by concatenating the two resulting video-encodings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Results</head><p>We compared these networks mainly on two subsets of the dataset with classes hand-picked to simplify the task and benchmark the complexity of the dataset (we refer to the supplementary materials for more details on selection of classes): 10 selected classes: We first pre-select 41 "easy" classes. We then generate 10 classes to train the networks (shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), where each class is formed by grouping together one or more of the original 41 classes with similar semantics. The mapping from 41 to 10 classes is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref> in the appendix. The total number of videos in this case is 28198. 40 selected classes: Keeping the above 10 groups, we select 30 additional common classes. The total number of samples in this case is 53267. Some example predictions from the 10-class model are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>We show the error rates for these subsets using the baselines described above in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. It shows that the difficulty of the task grows significantly as the number of classes are increased (despite the corresponding growth of the trainingset). Similar to datasets like Imagenet, ambiguities in the labels make the naive classification performance look deceptively weak. However, even the top-2 performance shows that there the dataset poses a significant challenge for these architectures.</p><p>We also experimented on all 174 classes using a 3D CNN model pre-trained on the 40 selected classes, and obtained error rates of top-1: 88.5%, top-5: 70.3%.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that the presence of subtle distinctions (using grouping, contrastive examples and other design choices) makes this an extraordinarily difficult problem for standard architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Advances in common sense reasoning can come mainly from two sources: through learning from interactions with the world, and through learning from observing the world. The first, interactions, rely crucially on advances in robotics. Unlike human interactions, however, robotic interactions lack the sophisticated tactile sensing that allows, for example, blind humans to learn about the world without any vision. It seems likely that even a robotics-based approach to learning common sense will rely on highly capable visual perception and on visuomotor policies that can deal with video input.</p><p>The dataset and learning methods that we describe in this work fall into the second category: learning about the world through vision. In contrast to unsupervised approaches, based on video-prediction, we propose approaching the problem through supervised learning on fine-grained labeling tasks.</p><p>The database introduced in this paper is an ongoing collection effort. We will continue to grow and extend the dataset over time in response to, and as a function of, the ability of networks to learn from this data.</p></div>
