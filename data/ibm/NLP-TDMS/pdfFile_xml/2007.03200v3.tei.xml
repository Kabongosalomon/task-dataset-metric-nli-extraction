<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), which depends on information from the bounding box, faces a great challenge, since different objects may stay in the same bounding box and increase the ambiguity to distinguish them. Recently, some researchers in this filed have moved their eyes to Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) and hope to take advantage of object-instance masks. Under such a background, the first MOTS challenge is organized to explore solutions for MOTS. We participated in this challenge * Corresponding email: yang.fan.xv6@is.naist.jp (May-30th-2020) and won the 1 st place on Challenge 1. In this paper, we represent our solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method Details</head><p>Overall, we apply the tracking-by-detection strategy to generate MOTS results. Since our ReMOTS is an offline approach, we refine the data association by retraining the appearance feature encoder. In each step of ReMOTS, we give a practical guidance to quantitatively select hyperparameters. Our approach is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. After obtaining object-instance masks, we perform: (1) encoder training with intra-frame data, (2) associate masks to short-term tracklets by a short-term tracker, (3) inter-short-tracklet encoder retraining, and (4) merging short-term tracklets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Generate Object-Instance Masks</head><p>Referring to how the public detection is generated, we obtain object-instance masks using the Mask R-CNN X152 of Detectron 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and X-101-64x4d-FPN of MMDetection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We fuse their segmentation results by a modified Non-maximum Suppression (NMS). Unlike the traditional NMS, where the IoU (Intersection over Union) is applied, we propose a new metric named IoM (Intersection over Minimum) for it since heavily overlapped masks may also have low IoU values. The python code of IoM is as follows. After performing our modified NMS, the remaining masks may still have overlapped areas. Therefore, we only keep the mask with the top confident score for each overlapping area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Encoder Training with Intra-frame Data</head><p>We take an off-the-shelf appearance encoder and its training scheme from an object re-identification work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. SeResNeXt50 is used as the backbone and its globalaverage-pooling output, which is a 2048-dimension vector, is used as the appearance features. The triplet loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is applied to train the appearance encoder. To adapt the appearance feature learning to the target videos, we incorporate intra-frame observations of target videos into a novel offline training process.</p><p>As <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows, we can sample triplets from the training set only referring to the ground-truth tracklets. In test set, since Non-maximum Suppression (NMS) is performed, we assume that predicted object masks are exclusive within the same frame, and therefore it is easy to form negative pairs with intra-frame observations. Before tracking, we create a positive sample by augmenting an anchor sample. The augmentation process can dramatically change the pixel content of the anchor sample without altering identity. Finally, we take triplets from the training set and target set to form a mini-batch input by the ratio of 1 : 1. Using such new training samples, we retrain the appearance encoder to obtain more discriminative appearance features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Short-term Tracker</head><p>After intra-frame training, we apply the appearance encoder to generate appearance features for data association. Since the tracker part is not our main focus, we build a simple tracker that only associates two-frame observations at once. Using the dense optical flow function of OpenCV, we generate optical flow between two adjacent frames, and then warp the mask from previous frame to current frame to calculate IoU of cross-frame masks. The distance matrix is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W short prev,curr = inf, if IoU (mask prev , mask curr ) = 0 1 − fprevfcurr fprev fcurr , otherwise<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where mask prev and mask curr respectively denote the mask of the previous frame and the mask of the current frame; W short prev,curr is their edge weight (i.e., distance); f prev and f curr are their appearance features.</p><p>Besides constraining data association with low IoU values, we also hope to constrain data association with low appearance similarity. However, it is tricky to heuristically determine a threshold for constraining. We tackle this issue by analyzing the intra-frame distribution. Specifically, the histogram of appearance cosine similarity between intra-frame masks can be approximated by a normal distribution, and within three standard deviations is 99.7% of the observation pairs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). We set an appearance affinity threshold at three standard deviations, as value θ app short . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: The appearance threshold value for short-term tracking.</p><p>Consequently, using automatically obtained θ app short , we further process W short prev,curr by (2) We apply linear assignment on W short prev,curr to determine the association of masks between the previous frame and the current frame. Due to misdetection and occlusion, such a process can only generate short-term tracklets. However, short-term tracklets reduce the risk of mixing different identities, which is an important condition in next-step process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Inter-short-tracklet Encoder Retraining</head><p>As we assume each short-term tracklet may only contain a unique identity, they can be used as dependable pseudo labels to train the feature encoder. However, different shortterm tracklets, which have no overlap in the temporal domain, may still hold the same identity. Therefore, we do inter-short-tracklet retraining under the constraint that sampled short-term tracklets must be temporally overlapping within the same video.</p><p>We illustrate the process of training data sampling for inter-short-tracklet training as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows. Within a video, we first sample two identities that appear in a randomly chosen frame, and then randomly choose another frame for one of the selected identities, thus constructing a triplet. Other settings of inter-short-tracklet training are the same as intra-frame retraining. We update the appearance features after inter-short-tracklet retraining and use them in the next step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Merging Short-term Tracklets</head><p>With better appearance features and more robust spatiotemporal information of short-term tracklets, we are able to merge short-term tracklets into long-term ones. The merging process is summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Short-term tracklets association is formulated as a hierarchical clustering problem on a weighted graph, in which each node represents a tracklet and the graph edges are represented in a distance matrix W long , defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W long k1,k2 =          inf, if k1 = k2 inf, if Distance(Π k1 , Π k2 ) &gt; θ t inf, if Π k1 ∩ Π k2 = ∅ 1 Nk1Nk2 i∈Πk1 j∈Πk2 1 − f k1 i f k2 j f k1 i f k2 j , otherwise ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where for tracklets T k1 and T k2 , W long k1,k2 is their edge weight (i.e., distance); Π k1 and Π k2 are their temporal ranges; f k1 i and f k2 j are their appearance features at frame i and j, and N k1 and N k2 are the number of observations within the tracklets, respectively. Whenever the matching condition between two shortterm tracklets violates any of the following three principles: (1) different short-term track ID, (2) the temporal gap between two short-term tracklets are within θ t frames (we use θ t = 15 ), and (3) no temporal overlap between two shortterm tracklets, we set their distance value to be infinite. To hold these constraints in the whole process of hierarchical clustering, we apply the centroid linkage criteria to determine the distance between clusters.</p><p>The main challenge of applying hierarchical clustering is on how to set a proper cutting threshold. We do not give a heuristic value, and we let the data speak for themselves instead. We suppose that intra-frame and inter-short-tracklet cosine similarity histograms can be separated at θ app long (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) after inter-short-tracket retraining, though small overlapping might exist. Without accessing to the groundtruth, this could be a reasonable boundary to distinguish objects based on appearance features. Therefore, we set 1 − θ app long as the cutting threshold in hierarchical clustering.   Temporaloverlapped Short-term Tracklets <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: The appearance threshold value for merging short-term tracklets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Experimental Setup</head><p>The only neural network model -appearance encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, used in this work, is not our contribution and our ReMOTS can do the same refining when other appearance models are used. Therefore, we do little change to the default setting of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, except for forming novel training samples in our intra-frame training and inter-short-tracklet training. Here, we omit the other details described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We report the performance of our ReMOTS on the MOTChallenge evaluation system, with metrics introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, we list the performance of top-3 methods up to the submission deadline. Our method mainly outperform the other two methods in terms of IDF1 score, and therefore leads to state-of-the-art performance in this challenge. The detailed performance on each test sequence is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. Though the same method is applied, it can be observed that the performance of each sequence varies a lot. This may be attributed to the diversity between videos, which calls for more exploration in automatically adapting MOTS models to target videos. Our ReMOTS analyzes the statistical information at the entire video level, but the temporal local statistical information, which might be useful for fine-grained adaption, has not been considered yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We present our solution which wins the CVPR 2020 MOTS Challenge 1. In our proposed ReMOTS framework, intra-frame training and inter-short-tracklet training are introduced for learning better appearance features for more effective data association, which are our main contributions. Besides, we quantitatively demonstrate how to select proper thresholds by analyzing the statistical information of tracklets, which could be useful for other multiple object tracking works. The main limitation of ReMOTS is that it cannot be used in real-time scenarios, but it may bring insights to design better online MOTS method with feature adaptation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>mask, array([H,W]) 5 prediction: binary mask, array([H,W]) The illustration of ReMOTS Framework.
