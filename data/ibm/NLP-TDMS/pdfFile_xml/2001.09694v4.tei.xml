<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is an AI challenge that requires machines to determine the correct answers to questions based on a given passage. MRC systems must not only answer questions when necessary but also tactfully abstain from answering when no answer is available according to the given passage. When unanswerable questions are involved in the MRC task, an essential verification module called verifier is especially required in addition to the encoder, though the latest practice on MRC modeling still mostly benefits from adopting well pre-trained language models as the encoder block by only focusing on the "reading". This paper devotes itself to exploring better verifier design for the MRC task with unanswerable questions. Inspired by how humans solve reading comprehension questions, we proposed a retrospective reader (Retro-Reader) that integrates two stages of reading and verification strategies: 1) sketchy reading that briefly investigates the overall interactions of passage and question, and yields an initial judgment; 2) intensive reading that verifies the answer and gives the final prediction. The proposed reader is evaluated on two benchmark MRC challenge datasets SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Significance tests show that our model is significantly better than strong baselines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Passage:</head><p>Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm. Question: What cannot be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps? Gold Answer: no answer Plausible answer: algorithm tems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Choi et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Reddy, Chen, and Manning 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhang, Huang, and Zhao 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xu, Zhao, and Zhang 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. 2018</ref>). The early MRC systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kadlec et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen, Bolton, and Manning 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dhingra et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Seo et al. 2016</ref>) were designed on a latent hypothesis that all questions can be answered according to the given passage ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1-[a]</ref>), which is not always true for real-world cases. The recent progress on the MRC task has required that the model must be capable of distinguishing those unanswerable questions to avoid giving plausible answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018)</ref>. MRC task with unanswerable questions may be usually decomposed into two subtasks: 1) answerability verification and 2) reading comprehension. To determine unanswerable questions requires a deep understanding of the given text and requires more robust MRC models, making MRC much closer to real-world applications. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows an unanswerable example from SQuAD2.0 MRC task <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018)</ref>.</p><p>So far, a common reading system (reader) which solves MRC problem generally consists of two modules or building steps as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>-[a]: 1) building a robust language model (LM) as encoder; 2) designing ingenious mechanisms as decoder according to MRC task characteristics.  In the names of models [a-e], "(·)" represents a module, "+" means the parallel module and "-" is the pipeline. The right part is the detailed architecture of our proposed Retro-Reader.</p><p>Pre-trained language models (PrLMs) such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019)</ref> and XLNet ) have achieved success on various natural language processing tasks, which broadly play the role of a powerful encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhou, Zhang, and Zhao 2019)</ref>. However, it is quite time-consuming and resource-demanding to impart massive amounts of general knowledge from external corpora into a deep language model via pre-training.</p><p>Recently, most MRC readers keep the primary focus on the encoder side, i.e., the deep PrLMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lan et al. 2020)</ref>, as readers may simply and straightforwardly benefit from a strong enough encoder. Meanwhile, little attention is paid to the decoder side 1 of MRC models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hu et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Back et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reddy et al. 2020)</ref>, though it has been shown that better decoder or better manner of using encoder still has a significant impact on MRC performance, no matter how strong the encoder it is <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al. 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liu et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhu, Zhao, and Li 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For the concerned MRC challenge with unanswerable questions, a reader has to handle two aspects carefully: 1) give the accurate answers for answerable questions; 2) effectively distinguish the unanswerable questions, and then refuse to answer. Such requirements lead to the recent reader's design by introducing an extra verifier module or answer-verification mechanism. Most readers simply stack the verifier along with encoder and decoder parts in a pipeline or concatenation way <ref type="figure">(Figure 1-[</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">b-c])</formula><p>, which is shown suboptimal for installing a verifier.</p><p>As a natural practice of how humans solve complex reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zheng et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guthrie and Mosenthal 1987)</ref>, the first step is to read through the full passage along with the question and grasp the general idea; then, people re-read the full text and verify the answer if not so sure. Inspired by such a reading and comprehension pattern, we proposed a retrospective reader (Retro-Reader, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[d]</ref>) that integrates two stages of reading and verification strategies: 1) sketchy reading that briefly touches the relationship of passage and question, and yields an initial judgment; 2) intensive reading that verifies the answer and gives the final prediction. Our major contributions are three folds: 2 1. We propose a new retrospective reader design which is capable of effectively performing answer verification instead of simply stacking verifier in existing readers. 2. Experiments show that our reader can yield substantial improvements over strong baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art results on benchmark MRC tasks. 3. For the first time, we apply the significance test for the concerned MRC task and show that our models are significantly better than the baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The research of machine reading comprehension have attracted great interest with the release of a variety of bench-mark datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hill et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hermann et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rajpurkar et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Joshi et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lai et al. 2017</ref>). The early trend is a variety of attention-based interactions between passage and question, including Attention Sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kadlec et al. 2016)</ref>, Gated attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dhingra et al. 2017)</ref>, Self-matching , Attention over Attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cui et al. 2017</ref>) and Biattention <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Seo et al. 2016)</ref>. Recently, PrLMs dominate the encoder design for MRC and achieve great success. These PrLMs include ELMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Peters et al. 2018)</ref>, GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Radford et al. 2018)</ref>, BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019)</ref>, XLNet , RoBERTa , ALBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lan et al. 2020)</ref>, and ELECTRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Clark et al. 2020)</ref>. They show strong capacity for capturing the contextualized sentence-level language representations and greatly boost the benchmark performance of current MRC. Following this line, we take PrLMs as our backbone encoder.</p><p>In the meantime, the study of the decoder mechanisms has come to a bottleneck due to the already powerful PrLM encoder. Thus this work focuses on the non-encoder part, such as passage and question attention interactions, and especially the answer verification.</p><p>To solve the MRC task with unanswerable questions is though important, only a few studies paid attention to this topic with straightforward solutions. Mostly, a treatment is to adopt an extra answer verification layer, the answer span prediction and answer verification are trained jointly with multi-task learning <ref type="figure">(Figure 1-[c]</ref>). Such an implemented verification mechanism can also be as simple as an answerable threshold setting broadly used by powerful enough PrLMs for quickly building readers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhang et al. 2020b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu et al. (2018)</ref> appended an empty word token to the context and added a simple classification layer to the reader. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hu et al. (2019)</ref> used two types of auxiliary loss, independent span loss to predict plausible answers and independent no-answer loss the to decide answerability of the question. Further, an extra verifier is adopted to decide whether the predicted answer is entailed by the input snippets <ref type="figure">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Proposed Model</head><p>We focus on the span-based MRC task, which can be described as a triplet P, Q, A , where P is a passage, and Q is a query over P , in which a span is a right answer A. Our system is supposed to not only predict the start and end po-sitions in the passage P and extract span as answer A but also return a null string when the question is unanswerable.</p><p>Our retrospective reader is composed of two parallel modules: a sketchy reading module and an intensive reading module to conduct a two-stage reading process. The intuition behind the design is that the sketchy reading makes a coarse judgment (external front verification) about the answerability, whether the question is answerable; and then the intensive reading jointly predicts the candidate answers and combines its answerability confidence (internal front verification) with the sketchy judgment score to yield the final answer (rear verification). 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sketchy Reading Module</head><p>Embedding We concatenate question and passage texts as the input, which is firstly represented as embedding vectors to feed an encoder (i.e., a PrLM). In detail, the input texts are first tokenized to word pieces (subword tokens). Let T = {t 1 , . . . , t n } denote a sequence of subword tokens of length n. For each token, the input embedding is the sum of its token embedding, position embedding, and token-type embedding. Let X = {x 1 , . . . , x n } be the outputs of the encoder, which are embedding features of encoding sentence tokens of length n. The input embeddings are then fed to the interaction layer to obtain the contextual representations.</p><p>Interaction Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>, the encoded sequence X is processed to a multi-layer Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref> for learning contextual representations. For the following part, we use H = {h 1 , . . . , h n } to denote the last-layer hidden states of the input sequence.</p><p>External Front Verification After reading, the sketchy reader will make a preliminary judgment, whether the question is answerable given the context. We implement this reader as an external front verifier (E-FV) to identify unanswerable questions. The pooled first token (the special symbol, [CLS]) representation h 1 ∈ H, as the overall representation of the sequence, is passed to a fully connection layer to get classification logitsŷ i composed of answerable (logit ans ) and unanswerable (logit na ) elements. We use cross entropy as training objective: <ref type="formula">1)</ref> whereŷ i ∝ SoftMax(FFN(h 1 )) denotes the prediction and y i is the target indicating whethter the question is answerbale or not. N is the number of examples. We calculate the difference as the external verification score: score ext = logit na −logit ans , which is used in the later rear verification as effective indication factor.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L ans = − 1 N N i=1 [y i logŷ i + (1 − y i ) log(1 −ŷ i )] (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Intensive Reading Module</head><p>The objective of the intensive reader is to verify the answerability, produce candidate answer spans, and then give the final answer prediction. It employs the same encoding and interaction procedure as the sketchy reader, to obtain the representation H. In previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lan et al. 2020)</ref>, H is directly fed to a linear layer to yield the prediction.</p><p>Question-aware Matching Inspired by previous success of explicit attention matching between passage and question <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kadlec et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dhingra et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Seo et al. 2016)</ref>, we are interested in whether the advance still holds based on the strong PrLMs. Here we investigate two alternative question-aware matching mechanisms as an extra layer. Note that this part is only used for ablation in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 7</ref> as a reference for interested readers. We do not use any extra matching part in our submission on test evaluations (e.g., in Tables 2-3) for the sake of simplicity as our major focus is the verification.</p><p>To obtain the representation of each passage and question, we split the last-layer hidden state H into H Q and H P as the representations of the question and passage, according to its position information. Both of the sequences are padded to the maximum length in a minibatch. Then, we investigate two potential question-aware matching mechanisms, 1) Transformer-style multi-head cross attention (CA) and 2) traditional matching attention (MA).</p><p>• Cross Attention We feed the H Q and H to a revised one-layer multi-head attention layer inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lu et al. (2019)</ref>. Since the setting is Q = K = V in multi-head self attention, 4 which are all derived from the input sequence, we replace the input to Q with H, and both of K and V with H Q to obtain the question-aware context representation H .</p><p>• Matching Attention Another alternative is to feed H Q and H to a traditional matching attention layer , by taking the question presentation H Q as the attention to the representation H:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M = SoftMax(H(WH Q + b ⊗ e) T ), H = MH Q ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where W and b are learnable parameters. e is a all-ones vector and used to repeat the bias vector into the matrix. M denotes the weights assigned to the different hidden states in the concerned two sequences. H is the weighted sum of all the hidden states and it represents how the vectors in H can be aligned to each hidden state in H Q . Finally, the representation H is used for the later predictions. If we do not use the above matching like the original use in BERT models, then H = H for the following part.</p><p>Span Prediction The aim of span-based MRC is to find a span in the passage as answer, thus we employ a linear layer 4 In this work, Q, K, V correspond to the items Q l+1 m x l i , K l+1 m x l j , V l+1 m x l j , respectively.</p><p>with SoftMax operation and feed H as the input to obtain the start and end probabilities, s and e:</p><p>s, e ∝ SoftMax <ref type="figure">(FFN(H )</ref>).</p><p>( <ref type="formula">3)</ref> The training objective of answer span prediction is defined as cross entropy loss for the start and end predictions,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L span = − 1 N N i [log(p s y s i ) + log(p e y e i )]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where y s i and y e i are respectively ground-truth start and end positions of example i. N is the number of examples.</p><p>Internal Front Verification We adopted an internal front verifier (I-FV) such that the intensive reader can identify unanswerable questions as well. In general, a verifier's function can be implemented as a cross-entropy loss (I-FV-CE), binary cross-entropy loss (I-FV-BE), or regressionstyle mean square error loss (I-FV-MSE). The pooled representation h 1 ∈ H , is passed to a fully connected layer to get the classification logits or regression score. Letŷ i ∝ Linear(h 1 ) denote the prediction and y i is the answerability target, the three alternative loss functions are as defined as follows:</p><p>(1) We use cross entropy as loss function for the classification verification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y i,k = SoftMax(FFN(h 1 )), L ans = − 1 N N i=1 K k=1 [y i,k logȳ i,k ] ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where K means the number of classes (K = 2 in this work). N is the number of examples.</p><p>(2) For binary cross entropy as loss function for the classification verification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y i = Sigmoid(FFN(h 1 )), L ans = − 1 N N i=1 [y i logȳ i + (1 − y i ) log(1 −ȳ i )] .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>(3) For the regression verification, mean square error is adopted as its loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y i = FFN(h 1 ),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">L ans = 1 N N i=1 (y i −ȳ i ) 2 .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>During training, the joint loss function for FV is the weighted sum of the span loss and verification loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L = α 1 L span + α 2 L ans ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where α 1 and α 2 are weights.</p><p>Threshold-based Answerable Verification Following previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lan et al. 2020)</ref>, we adopt threshold based answerable verification (TAV), which is a heuristic strategy to decide whether a question is answerable according to the predicted answer start and end logits finally. Given the output start and end probabilities s and e, and the verification probability v, we calculate the has-answer score score has and the no-answer score score null :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">score has = max(s k + e l ), 1 &lt; k ≤ l ≤ n, score null = s 1 + e 1 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We obtain a difference score between score null and the score has as the final no-answer score: score dif f = score null − score has . An answerable threshold δ is set and determined according to the development set. The model predicts the answer span that gives the has-answer score if the final score is above the threshold δ, and null string otherwise.</p><p>TAV is used in all our models as the last step for the answerability decision. We denote it in our baselines with (+TAV) as default in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>-3, and omit the notation for simplicity in analysis part to avoid misunderstanding to keep on the specific ablations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Rear Verification</head><p>Rear verification (RV) is the combination of predicted probabilities of E-FV and I-FV, which is an aggregated verification for final answer.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">v = β 1 score dif f + β 2 score ext ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where β 1 and β 2 are weights.

The training dataset contains 87k answerable and 43k unanswerable questions.</p><p>NewsQA NewsQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Trischler et al. 2017</ref>) is a questionanswering dataset with 100,000 human-generated questionanswer pairs. The questions and answers are based on a set of over 10,000 news articles from CNN supplied by crowdworkers. The paragraphs are about 600 words on average, which tend to be longer than SQuAD2.0. The training dataset has 20k unanswerable questions among 97k questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>Metrics Two official metrics are used to evaluate the model performance: Exact Match (EM) and a softer metric F1 score, which measures the average overlap between the prediction and ground truth answer at the token level.</p><p>Significance Test With the rapid development of deep MRC models, the dominant models have achieved very high  results (e.g., over 90% F1 scores on SQuAD2.0), and further advance has been very marginal. Thus a significance test would be beneficial for measuring the difference in model performance.</p><p>For selecting evaluation metrics for the significance test, since answers vary in length, using the F1 score would have a bias when comparing models, i.e., if one model fails on one severe example though works well on the others. Therefore, we use the tougher metric EM as the goodness measure. If the EM is equal to 1, the prediction is regarded as right and vice versa. Then the test is modeled as a binary classification problem to estimate the answer of the model is exactly right (EM=1) or wrong (EM=0) for each question. According to our task setting, we used McNemar's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(McNemar 1947)</ref> to test the statistical significance of our results. This test is designed for paired nominal observations, and it is appropriate for binary classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ziser and Reichart 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The p-value is defined as the probability, under the null hypothesis, of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was observed. The smaller the p-value, the higher the significance. A commonly used level of reliability of the result is 95%, written as p = 0.05.</p></div>

Retro-Reader on ALBERT and Retro-Reader on ELECTRA denote our final models (i.e., our submissions to SQuAD2.0 online evaluation), which are respectively the ALBERT and ELECTRA based retrospective reader composed of both sketchy and intensive reading modules without question-aware matching for simplicity. According to the results, we make the following observations: 1) Our implemented ALBERT and ELECTRA baselines show the similar EM and F1 scores with the original num-   bers reported in the corresponding papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lan et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Clark et al. 2020)</ref>, ensuring that the proposed method can be fairly evaluated over the public strong baseline systems.</p><p>2) In terms of powerful enough PrLMs like ALBERT and ELECTRA, our Retro-Reader not only significantly outperforms the baselines with p-value &lt; 0.01, 8 but also achieves new state-of-the-art on the SQuAD2.0 challenge. 9</p><p>3) The results on NewsQA further verifies the general effectiveness of our proposed Retro-Reader. Our method shows consistent improvements over the baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> show that our method improves the performance on unanswerable questions by a large margin, especially in the primary F1 and accuracy metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparisons with Equivalent Parameters</head><p>When using sketchy reading module for external verification, we have two parallel modules that have independent parameters. For comparisons with equivalent parameters, we add an ensemble of two baseline models, to see if the advance is purely from the increase of parameters. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref> shows the results. We see that our model can still outperform two ensembled models. Although the two modules share the same design of the Transformer encoder, the training objectives (e.g., loss functions) are quite different, one for answer span prediction, the other for answerable decision. The results indicate that our two-stage reading modules would be more effective for learning diverse aspects (verification and span prediction) for solving MRC tasks with different training objectives. From the two modules, we can easily find the effectiveness of either the span prediction or answer verification, to improve the modules correspondingly. We believe this design would be quite useful for real-world applications. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 7</ref> shows the results with different interaction methods described in §3.2. We see that merely adding extra lay-Passage: Southern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, home to some of the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped. It is the third most populated megalopolis in the United States, after the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the Northeastern megalopolis. Much of southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways. The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and Riverside-San Bernardino, each of which are the centers of their respective metropolitan areas...</p></div>

Retro-Reader over ALBERT: no answer score has = 0.03, score na = 1.73, δ = −0.98 ers could not bring noticeable improvement, which indicates that simply adding more layers and parameters would not substantially benefit the model performance. The results verified the PrLMs' strong ability to capture the relationships between passage and question after processing the paired input by deep self-attention layers. In contrast, answer verification could still give consistent and substantial advance.</p></div>

Inspired by human reading comprehension experience, we proposed a retrospective reader that integrates both sketchy and intensive reading. With the latest PrLM as encoder backbone and baseline, the proposed reader is evaluated on two benchmark MRC challenge datasets SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA, achieving new state-of-the-art results and outperforming strong baseline models in terms of newly introduced statistical significance, which shows the choice of verification mechanisms has a significant impact for MRC performance and verifier is an indispensable reader component even for powerful enough PrLMs used as the en-</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1-[b]).<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Back et al.
