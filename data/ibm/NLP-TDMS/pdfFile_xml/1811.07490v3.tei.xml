<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Natural spatiotemporal processes can be highly nonstationary in many ways, e.g. the low-level non-stationarity such as spatial correlations or temporal dependencies of local pixel values; and the high-level variations such as the accumulation, deformation or dissipation of radar echoes in precipitation forecasting. From Cramér's Decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, any non-stationary process can be decomposed into deterministic, time-variant polynomials, plus a zero-mean stochastic term. By applying differencing operations appropriately, we may turn time-variant polynomials into a constant, making the deterministic component predictable.</p><p>However, most previous recurrent neural networks for spatiotemporal prediction do not use the differential signals effectively, and their relatively simple state transition functions prevent them from learning too complicated variations in spacetime. We propose the Memory In Memory (MIM) networks and corresponding recurrent blocks for this purpose. The MIM blocks exploit the differential signals between adjacent recurrent states to model the non-stationary and approximately stationary properties in spatiotemporal dynamics with two cascaded, self-renewed memory modules. By stacking multiple MIM blocks, we could potentially handle higher-order non-stationarity. The MIM networks achieve the state-of-the-art results on four spatiotemporal prediction tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We believe that the general idea of this work can be potentially applied to other time-series forecasting tasks.</p></div>

Note that different regions have different variation trends, making the spatiotemporal prediction problem extremely challenging.</p><p>changing over time. Learning higher-order properties underlying the spatiotemporal non-stationarity is particularly significant for many video prediction tasks. Examples include modeling highly complicated real-world systems such as traffic flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> and weather conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. A well-performed predictive model is expected to learn the intrinsic variations in consecutive spatiotemporal context, which can be seen as a combination of the stationary component and the deterministic non-stationary component. A great challenge in non-stationary spatiotemporal prediction is how to effectively capture higher-order trends regarding each pixel and its local area. For example, when making precipitation forecasting, one should carefully consider the complicated and diverse local trends on the evolving radar maps, shown as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. But this problem is extremely difficult due to the complicated non-stationarity in both space and time. Most prior work handles trend-like non-stationarity with recursions of CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> or relatively simple state transitions in RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. The lack of non-stationary modeling capability prevents reasoning about uncertainties in spatiotemporal dynamics and partially leads to the blurry effect of the predicted frames.</p><p>We attempt to resolve this problem by proposing a generic RNNs architecture that is more effective in non-stationarity modeling. We find that though the forget gates in the recurrent predictive models could deliver, select, and discard information in the process of memory state transitions, they are too simple to capture higher-order non-stationary trends in high-dimensional time series. In particular, the forget gates in the recent PredRNN model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> does not work appropriately on precipitation forecasting: about 80% of them are saturated over all timestamps, implying almost timeinvariant memory state transitions. In other words, future frames are predicted by approximately linear extrapolations.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on improving the memory transition functions of RNNs. Most statistical forecasting methods in classic time series analysis assume that the non-stationary trends can be rendered approximately stationary by performing suitable transformations such as differencing. We introduce this idea to RNNs and propose a new RNNs building block named Memory In Memory (MIM), which leverages the differential information between neighboring hidden states in the recurrent paths. MIM can be viewed as an improved version of LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, whose forget gate is replaced by another two embedded long short-term memories.</p><p>MIM has the following characteristics: (1) It creates unified modeling for the spatiotemporal non-stationarity by differencing neighboring hidden states rather than raw images. (2) By stacking multiple MIM blocks, our model has a chance to gradually stationarize the spatiotemporal process and make it more predictable. (3) Note that over-differencing is no good for time series prediction, as it may inevitably lead to a loss of information. This is another reason that we apply differencing in memory transitions rather than all recurrent signals, e.g. the input gate and the input modulation gate. (4) MIM has one memory cell adopted from LSTMs as well as two additional recurrent modules with their own memories embedded in the transition path of the first memory. We use these modules to respectively model the higher-order non-stationary and approximately stationary components of the spatiotemporal dynamics. The proposed MIM networks achieve the state-of-the-art results on multiple prediction tasks, including a widely used synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">ARIMA Models for Time Series Forecasting</head><p>Our model is inspired by the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. A time-series random variable whose power spectrum remains constant over time can be viewed as a combination of signal and noise. An ARIMA model aims to separate the signal from the noise. The obtained signal is then extrapolated into the future. In theory, it tackles time series forecasting by transforming the non-stationary process to stationary through differencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Deterministic Spatiotemporal Prediction</head><p>Spatiotemporal non-stationary processes are more complicated, as the joint distribution of neighboring pixel values is varying in both space and time. Like low-dimensional time series, they can also be decomposed into deterministic and stochastic components. Recent work in neural networks explored spatiotemporal prediction from these two aspects.</p><p>CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have been widely used for learning the deterministic spatial correlations and temporal dependencies from videos. Ranzato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> defined a recurrent model predicting frames in a discrete space of patch clusters. Srivastava et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> introduced the sequence to sequence LSTM network from language modeling to video prediction. But this model can only capture temporal variations. To learn spatial and temporal variations in a unified network structure, Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> integrated the convolution operator into recurrent state transition functions, and proposed the Convolutional LSTM. Finn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> developed an action-conditioned video prediction model that can be further used in robotics planning when combined with the model predictive control methods. Villegas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Patraucean et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> presented recurrent models based on the convolutional LSTM that leverage optical flow guided features. Kalchbrenner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed the Video Pixel Network (VPN) that encodes the time, space, color structures of videos as a four-dimensional dependency chain. It achieves sharp prediction results but suffers from a high computational complexity. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> extended the convolutional LSTM with zigzag memory flows, which provides a great modeling capability for short-term video dynamics.

MIM is designed to introduce two recurrent modules (yellow squares) to replace the forget gate (dashed box) in ST-LSTM. MIM-N is the non-stationary module and MIM-S is the stationary module. Note that the MIM block cannot be used in the first layer so the input Xt is replaced by H l−1 t . whose temporal transition methods are relatively simple, either controlled by the recurrent gate structures or implemented by the recursion of the feed-forward network. By contrast, our model is characterized by exploiting high-order differencing to mitigate the non-stationary learning difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Stochastic Spatiotemporal Prediction</head><p>Some recent methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> attempted to model the stochastic component of video dynamics using Variational Autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. These methods increase the prediction diversity but are difficult to evaluate and require to run a great number of times for a satisfactory result. In this paper, we focus on the deterministic part of spatiotemporal non-stationarity. More specifically, this work attempts to stationarize the complicated spatiotemporal processes and make their deterministic components in the future more predictable by proposing new RNNs architecture for non-stationarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>As mentioned above, the spatiotemporal non-stationarity remains under-explored and its differential features have not been fully exploited by previous methods using neural networks. In this section, we first present the Memory In Memory (MIM) blocks for learning about the higher-order non-stationarity from RNNs memory transitions. We then discuss a new RNN architecture, which interlinks multiple MIM blocks with diagonal state connections, for modeling the differential information in the spatiotemporal prediction. By stacking multiple MIM blocks, we could potentially learn higher-order non-stationarity from spatiotemporal dynamics. The proposed MIM state transition approach can be integrated into all LSTM-like units. We choose the Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> as our base network for a trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation simplicity. ST-LSTM is characterized by a dual-memory structure, C l t and M l t , as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (left). The corre-sponding zigzag memory flow of M l t , as illustrated by the black arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, strengthens its short-term modeling capability by increasing the recurrent transition depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Memory In Memory Blocks</head><p>We observe that the complex dynamics in spatiotemporal sequences can be handled more effectively as a combination of stationary variations and non-stationary variations. Suppose we have a video sequence showing a person walking at a constant speed. The velocity can be seen as a stationary variable and the swing of the legs should be considered as a non-stationary process, which is apparently more difficult to predict. Unfortunately, the forget gate in previous LSTM-like models is a simple gating structure that struggles to capture the non-stationary variations in spacetime. In preliminary experiments, we find that the majority of forget gates in the recent PredRNN model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> are saturated, implying that the units always remember stationary variations.</p><p>The Memory In Memory (MIM) block is enlightened by the idea of modeling the non-stationary variations using a series of cascaded memory transitions instead of the simple, saturation-prone forget gate in ST-LSTM. As compared in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> (the smaller dashed boxes), two cascaded temporal memory recurrent modules are designed to replace the temporal forget gate f t in ST-LSTM. The first module additionally taking H l−1 t−1 as input is used to capture the non-stationary variations based on the differencing (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ) between two consecutive hidden representations. So we name it the non-stationary module (shown as MIM-N in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). It generates differential features D l t based on the difference-stationary assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The other recurrent module takes as inputs the output D l t of the MIM-N module and the outer temporal memory C l t−1 to capture the approximately stationary variations in spatiotemporal sequences. So we call it the stationary module (shown as MIM-S in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). By replacing the forget gate with the final output T l t of the cascaded non-stationary and stationary modules (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), the non-stationary dynamics can be captured more effectively. Key calculations inside a MIM block can be shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">gt = tanh(Wxg * H l−1 t + W hg * H l t−1 + bg) it = σ(Wxi * H l−1 t + W hi * H l t−1 + bi) D l t = MIM-N(H l−1 t , H l−1 t−1 , N l t−1 ) T l t = MIM-S(D l t , C l t−1 , S l t−1 ) C l t = T l t + it gt g t = tanh(W xg * H l−1 t + Wmg * M l−1 t + b g ) i t = σ(W xi * H l−1 t + Wmi * M l−1 t + b i ) f t = σ(W xf * H l−1 t + W mf * M l−1 t + b f ) M l t = f t M l−1 t + i t g t ot = σ(Wxo * H l−1 t + W ho * H l t−1 + Wco * C l t + Wmo * M l t + bo) H l t = ot tanh(W1×1 * [C l t , M l t ]),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S and N denote the horizontally-transited memory cells in the non-stationary module (MIM-N) and stationary module (MIM-S) respectively; D is the differential features learned by MIM-N and fed into MIM-S; T is the memory passing the virtual "forget gate"; and * denotes convolution. The cascaded structure enables end-to-end modeling of different orders of non-stationary dynamics. It is based on the difference-stationary assumption that differencing a nonstationary process repeatedly will likely lead to a stationary one <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. A schematic of MIM-N and MIM-S is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. We present the detailed calculations of MIM-N as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">gt = tanh(Wxg * (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ) + Wng * N l t−1 + bg) it = σ(Wxi * (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ) + Wni * N l t−1 + bi) ft = σ(W xf * (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ) + W nf * N l t−1 + b f ) N l t = ft N l t−1 + it gt ot = σ(Wxo * (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ) + Wno * N l t + bo) D l t = MIM-N(H l−1 t , H l−1 t−1 , N l t−1 ) = ot tanh(N l t ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where all gates g t , i t , f t and o t are updated by incorporating the frame difference (H l−1 t − H l−1 t−1 ), which highlights the non-stationary variations in the spatiotemporal sequence. The detailed calculations of MIM-S are shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">gt = tanh(W dg * D l t + Wcg * C l t−1 + bg) it = σ(W di * D l t + Wci * C l t−1 + bi) ft = σ(W df * D l t + W cf * C l t−1 + b f ) S l t = ft S l t−1 + it gt ot = σ(W do * D l t + Wco * C l t−1 + Wso * S l t + bo) T l t = MIM-S(D l t , C l t−1 , S l t−1 ) = ot tanh(S l t ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which takes the memory cells C l t−1 and the differential features D l t generated by MIM-N as input. As can be validated, the stationary module provides a gating mechanism to adaptively decide whether to trust the original memory C l t−1 or the differential features D l t . If the differential features vanish, indicating that the non-stationary dynamics is not prominent, then MIM-S will mainly reuse the original memory. Otherwise, if the differential features are prominent, then MIM-S will overwrite the original memory and focus more on the non-stationary dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Memory In Memory Networks</head><p>Stacking multiple MIM blocks, our model has a chance to capture higher orders of non-stationarity, gradually stationarizes the spatiotemporal process and makes the future sequence more predictable. The key idea of this architecture is to deliver necessary hidden states for generating differential features and best facilitating non-stationarity modeling.</p><p>A schematic of our proposed diagonal recurrent architecture is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. We deliver the hidden states H l−1 t−1 and H l−1 t to the Memory In Memory (MIM) block at timestamp t = 1 and layer l = 1 to generate the differenced features for further use. These connections are shown as diagonal arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. As the first layer does not have any previous layer, we simply use the Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to generate its hidden presentations. Note that, the temporal differencing is performed by subtracting hidden state H l−1 t from the hidden state H l−1 t−1 in MIM. Compared to differencing neighboring raw images directly, differencing temporally adjacent hidden states can reveal the non-stationarity more evidently, as the spatiotemporal variations in local areas have been encoded into the hidden representations through the bottom ST-LSTM layer.</p><p>Another distinctive feature of the MIM networks resides in the horizontal state transition paths.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the proposed MIM model using four datasets for spatiotemporal prediction: a synthetic dataset with moving digits, a real traffic flow dataset, a real radar echo dataset, and a human action dataset. Here are some common settings all over these datasets. Our model has four layers in all experiments, including one ST-LSTM layer as the first layer and three MIMs. The number of feature channels in each MIM block is 64, as a trade-off of prediction accuracy and memory efficiency. All models are trained with the 2 loss, using the ADAM optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with a learning rate of 0.001. The mini-batch size is set to 8. We apply the layer normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to the compared models in order to reduce the covariate shift problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Besides, we apply the scheduled sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to all models to stitch the discrepancy between training and inference.

This example is challenging, as severe occlusions exist near the junction of the input sequence and the output sequence. The occlusions can be viewed as information bottleneck, in which the mean and variance of the spatiotemporal process meet drastic changes, indicating the presence of a high-order nonstationarity. The generated images of MIM are more satisfactory, less blurry than those of other models. Actually, we cannot even tell the digits in the last frames generated by other models.

Though in other parts of this paper, we use ST-LSTM as our base structure for a trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational complexity, we can see that MIM performs better than its ST-LSTM (PredRNN) baseline, while MIM* also performs better than its Causal LSTM baseline. We also adopt the gradient-based sharpness metric from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to measure the sharpness of the generated images.

As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, a great portion of forget gates of these models are close to 0, indicating that the long short-term memories do not work properly. As the non-stationary signals within short-term variations are hard to be captured, these models have to refresh the memory states to convey these short-term hidden representations. Our model mitigates this problem and makes better use of long-term variations through the proposed MIM block. As MIM-N mainly reduces the non-stationarity, short-term tendencies become easier to be captured and more neurons in MIM-S can be used for handling long-term variations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">TaxiBJ Traffic Flow</head><p>Traffic flows are collected from the chaotic real-world environment. They will not vary uniformly over time, and there are strong temporal dependencies between the traffic conditions at neighboring timestamps. Each frame in TaxiBJ is a 32 × 32 × 2 grid of image. Two channels represent the traffic flow entering and leaving the same district. We normalize the data to [0, 1] and follow the experimental settings of ST-ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which yields the previous state-of-the-art results on this dataset. Each sequence contains 8 consecutive frames, 4 for the inputs and 4 for the predictions. We show the quantitative results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> and the qualitative results in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. To make the comparisons conspicuous, we also visualize the difference between the predictions and the ground truth images. Obviously, MIM shows the best performance in all predicted frames among all compared models, with the lowest difference intensities.</p></div>

Each frame is a 64 × 64 × 1 grid of image, covering 64 × 64 square kilometers. We predict 10 timestamps into the future at a time interval of 6 minutes, covering the next hour. We visualize the generated radar maps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure  8</ref>. We can see that the evolution of radar echoes is a highly non-stationary process. The accumulation, deformation, and dissipation of the radar echoes are happening at every moment. In this showcase, the echoes in the bottom left corner aggregate while those in the upper right corner dissipate. Only MIM captures the movement of the echoes correctly.   <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: A comparison for predicting 10 frames on the subsets of the radar dataset.

CSI is defined as CSI = hits hits+misses+falsealarms , where hits corresponds to true positive, misses corresponds to false positive, and false alarms corresponds to false negative. A higher CSI denotes a better prediction result. MIM consistently outperforms other models in both MSE and CSI. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref> shows the frame-wise MSE/CSI.

The generated frames by MIM are more accurate in motion positions, as indicated by the orange boxes (versus the green boxes). We notice that some work performs well on human-body datasets by modeling the structures of human joints, while the MIM network is designed for non-structural, general-purpose spacetime data such as RGB videos. The structural and non-structural methods can be integrated and jointly used in a complementary manner, which is left for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We investigate the underlying non-stationarity that forms one of the main obstacles in spatiotemporal prediction. Existing LSTM-based models for spatiotemporal prediction are powerful in modeling difference-stationary sequences, whose capability for modeling high-order non-stationary process is limited by their relatively weak forget gates. This paper proposes a new recurrent neural network to enable nonstationary modeling in the spacetime contexts. We formulate high-order non-stationarity as high-order polynomials with respect to the statistically varying trends of pixel intensities. The order of non-stationary polynomials can be reduced by a couple of differencing operations. We leverage this idea from time-series analysis: stacking MIMs with differential inputs layer by layer. The Memory In Memory (MIM) block is derived to model the complicated variations, which uses two cascaded recurrent modules to handle the non-stationary and approximately stationary components in the spatiotemporal dynamics. MIM achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on four datasets: a synthetic dataset of flying digits, a traffic flow prediction dataset, a weather forecasting dataset, and a human pose video dataset.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The non-stationary module (MIM-N) and the stationary module (MIM-S), which are interlinked in a cascaded structure in the MIM block.
