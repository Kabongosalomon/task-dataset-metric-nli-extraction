<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The disjoint paths problem, a special case of the network flow problem with flows constrained to be binary, is a classical combinatorial optimization problem for which fast combinatorial solvers exist. It is a natural model for the multiple object tracking problem (MOT) in computer vision <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>. In the form of the tracking-bydetection paradigm, MOT consists of two steps: First, an object detector is applied to each frame of a video sequence to find the putative locations of all objects appearing in the video. Then, in the data association step, false positive de-tections are removed while correct detections are associated to the corresponding identities, thereby forming trajectories. In this work, we concentrate on the latter task.</p><p>While for MOT even very large data association instances can be solved using the disjoint paths formulation, it has been shown that the basic disjoint paths problem alone is not sufficient to provide trajectories of high accuracy. The main limitation for MOT is the implicit assumption of a first-order Markov chain. In particular, costs only indicate whether two detections directly follow each other in a track.</p><p>Our contribution is three-fold: First, to overcome the limited expressiveness of disjoint paths, we propose to augment it with lifted edges which take into account long range interactions. We call the resulting problem the lifted disjoint paths problem, see Section 3. We prove the problem to be NP-hard in Section 6. Second, we study the optimization problem from a polyhedral perspective, proposing a high-quality linear programming relaxation, see Section 4. Separation routines for the proposed constraints are described in Section 5. Third, we apply the lifted disjoint paths problem to MOT and show that our solver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on the popular MOT challenge, see Section 7.</p><p>We argue that our model has advantages from the modelling and optimization point of view. From the modelling standpoint, the lifted disjoint paths problem does not change the set of feasible solutions, but adds more expressive power to it. For MOT, this means that the set of feasible solutions, which naturally represent trajectories of objects, is preserved. The additional lifted edges represent connectivity priors. A lifted edge is active if and only if there is an active trajectory between its endpoints in the flow graph. For MOT, lifted edges take (dis-)similarity of object detection pairs represented by its endpoints into account. This allows to encourage or penalize an active path between the detections with possibly larger temporal distance. This helps to reidentify the same object and to prevent id-switches between distinct objects within long trajectories.</p><p>From the optimization point of view, we study several nontrivial classes of linear inequalities that result in a highquality relaxation. The proposed inequalities depend nontrivially on the constraint structure of the underlying disjoint paths problem, see Section 4. We show that the polyhe-arXiv:2006.14550v1 [cs.CV] 25 Jun 2020 dral relaxation we consider is tighter than naively applying known inequalities. The proposed relaxation enables us to solve MOT problems via a global approach, in contrast to established approaches, which either use heuristics on complex models or global optimization on simpler models that do not exploit long range interaction. We present, to our knowledge, the first global optimization approach that incorporates long range interaction for MOT. This has several advantages: First, our optimization is not trapped in poor local optima or affected by initialization choices and is hence potentially more robust. Second, improvements in the discriminative power of features used to compute costs for the lifted disjoint paths problem directly correlate to better tracking performance, since no errors are introduced by suboptimal choices during optimization.</p><p>Finally, we note that the proposed lifted disjoint path formulation is not inherently tied to MOT and can potentially be applied to further problems not related to MOT.</p><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/ AndreaHor/LifT_Solver.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectivity priors &amp; lifted edges.</head><p>For several combinatorial problems, special connectivity inducing edges, which we will call lifted edges for our problem, have been introduced to improve expressiveness of the base problem.</p><p>In the Markov Random Field literature, special connectivity inducing edges were studied from a polyhedral point of view in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nowozin &amp; Lampert, 2010)</ref>.

Lifted multicut has been used for image and mesh segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Keuper et al., 2015)</ref>, connectomics <ref type="bibr">(Beier et al., 2017)</ref> and cell tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Rempfler et al., 2017)</ref>. A combination of the lifted multicut problem and Markov Random Fields has been proposed in  with applications in instance-separating semantic segmentation . A polyhedral study of lifted multicut was presented in <ref type="bibr">(Horňáková et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>Yet, for the above problems, global optimization has only been reported for small instances.</p><p>Disjoint paths for MOT. The data association step of MOT has been approached using the disjoint path setup <ref type="bibr">(Berclaz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>, since disjoint paths through a graph naturally model trajectories of multiple objects. Extension of the plain disjoint paths problem that disallow certain pairs of detections to occur simultaneously have been used to fuse different object detectors <ref type="bibr">(Chari et al., 2015)</ref> and for multi-camera <ref type="bibr">MOT (Hofmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Leal-Taixé et al., 2012)</ref>. The drawback of these approaches is that they cannot integrate long range information, in contrast to our proposed formulation.</p><p>Other combinatorial approaches to MOT. The minimum cost arborescence problem, an extension of minimum spanning tree to directed graphs, has been used for MOT in <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2014)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Keuper et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kumar et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ristani &amp; Tomasi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tang et al., 2015;</ref> the multicut problem has been used for <ref type="bibr">MOT and in (Babaee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Tang et al., 2017)</ref> additionally lifted edges have been used to better model long range temporal interactions. The maximum clique problem, which corresponds to multicut with complete graphs has been applied for MOT in <ref type="bibr">(Zamir et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dehghan et al., 2015)</ref>. Maximum independent set, which corresponds to maximum clique on the complement graph, has been used for MOT in <ref type="bibr">(Brendel et al., 2011)</ref>. The multigraph-matching problem, a generalization of the graph matching problem, has been applied to <ref type="bibr">MOT in (Hu et al., 2019)</ref>. Consistency of individual matched detections is ensured by cycle-consistency constraints coming from the multi-graph matching. The works <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2018;</ref> reformulate tracking multiple objects with long temporal interactions as a binary quadratic program. If the problem size is small, the optimization problem can be solved optimally by reformulating it to an equivalent binary linear program <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr">von Marcard et al., 2018)</ref>. For large instances, an approximation is necessary. To this end, a specialized nonconvex Frank-Wolfe method can be used <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2018)</ref>. Common to the above state of the art trackers is that they either employ heuristic solvers or are limited in the integration of long range information, in contrast to our work.</p><p>Contribution w.r.t. existing combinatorial approaches. It is widely acknowledged that one crucial ingredient for obtaining high-quality MOT results is to incorporate long range temporal information to re-identify detections and prevent id-switches. However, from a theoretical perspective, we believe that long range information has not yet been incorporated satisfactorily in optimization formulations for the data association step in MOT.</p><p>In comparison to lifted multicut for MOT, we argue that from the modelling point of view, network flow has advantages. In multicut, clusters can be arbitrary, while in MOT, tracks are clusters that may not contain multiple detection hypotheses of distinct objects at the same time point. This exclusion constraint must be enforced in multicut explicitly via soft constraints, while the disjoint paths substructure automatically takes care of it. On the other hand, the lifted multicut approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Tang et al., 2017)</ref> has used the possibility to cluster multiple detections in one time frame. This directly incorporates non-maxima suppression in the optimization, which however increases computational complexity.</p><p>From a mathematical perspective, naively using polyhedral results from multicut is also not satisfactory. Specifically, one could naively obtain a polyhedral relaxation for the lifted disjoint paths problem by reusing the known polyhedral structure of lifted multicut <ref type="bibr">(Horňáková et al., 2017)</ref> and additionally adding network flow constraints for the disjoint paths substructure. However, this would give a suboptimal polyhedral relaxation. We show in Section 4 that the underlying structure of the disjoint paths problem can be used to derive new and tighter constraints for lifted edges. This enables us to use a global optimization approach for MOT. To our knowledge, our work is the first one to combine global optimization with long range interactions for MOT.</p><p>In comparison to works that propose non-convex algorithms or other heuristics for incorporating long range temporal edges <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zamir et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dehghan et al., 2015)</ref> our approach yields a more principled approach and globally optimal optimization solutions via LP-based branch and bound algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem Formulation</head><p>Below we recapitulate the disjoint paths problem and extend it by defining lifted edges. We discuss how the lifted disjoint paths problem can naturally model MOT. Proofs for statements in all subsequent sections can be found in the Appendix, Section ??.</p><p>Flow network and lifted graph. Consider two directed acyclic graphs G = (V, E) and G = (V , E ) where V = V \{s, t}. The graph G = (V, E) represents the flow network and we denote by G the lifted graph. The two special nodes s and t of G denote source and sink node respectively. We further assume that every node in V is reachable from s, and t can be reached from it.</p><p>We define the set of paths starting at v and ending in w as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">vw-paths(G) = (v 1 v 2 , . . . , v l−1 v l ) : v i v i+1 ∈ E, v 1 = v, v l = w .</formula><p>(1) For a vw-path P we denote its edge set as P E and its node set as P V .</p><p>The flow variables in G are denoted by y ∈ {0, 1} E for edges and x ∈ {0, 1} V for nodes. Allowing only 0/1 values of vertex variables reflects the requirement of vertex disjoint paths. Variables on the lifted edges E are denoted by y ∈ {0, 1} E . Here, y vw = 1 means that nodes v and w are connected via the flow y in G. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y vw = 1 ⇔ ∃P ∈ vw-paths(G) s.t. ∀ij ∈ P E : y ij = 1 .</formula><p>(2) </p><p>In Section 4, we present an ILP formulation of (3) by proposing several linear inequalities that lead to a high-quality linear relaxation.</p><p>Graph construction for multiple object tracking. We argue that the lifted disjoint paths problem is an appropriate way of modelling the data association problem for MOT. In MOT, an unknown number of objects needs to be tracked across a video sequence. This problem can be naturally formalized by a graph G = (V, E) where its node set V represents either object detections or tracklets of objects. If V represents object detections, we can express it as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V = s ∪ V 1 ∪ . . . ∪ V T ∪ t,</formula><p>where T is the number of frames and V i denotes the object detections in time i. We introduce edges between adjacent time frames. An active flow on such an edge denotes correspondences of the same object. We also introduce skip edges between time frames that are farther apart. An active flow on a skip edge also denotes correspondences between the same object that, in contrast, may have been been occluded or not detected in intermediate time frames. This classical network flow formulation has been commonly used for MOT <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>On top of the underlying flow formulation for MOT, we usually want to express that two detections belong to the same object connected by a possibly longer track with multiple detections in between. For that purpose, lifted edges with negative costs can be used. We say in such a case that an active lifted edge re-identifies two detections <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Tang et al., 2017)</ref>. If two detections with larger temporal distance should not be part of the same track, a positive valued lifted edge can be used. In this case the lifted edge is used to prevent id-switches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Constraints</head><p>Below, we will first introduce constraints that give an integer linear program (ILP) of the lifted disjoint paths problem (3). The corresponding linear programming (LP) relaxation can be strenghtened by additional constraints that we present subsequently.</p><p>Many constraints considered below will rely on whether a node w is reachable from another node v in the flow network. We define to this end the reachability relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R ⊂ V 2 via vw ∈ R ⇔ vw-paths(G) = ∅ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In the special case of v = w, we also allow empty paths, which means ∀v ∈ V : vv ∈ R. This makes relation R reflexive.</p><p>Flow conservation constraints. The flow variables y obey, as in classical network flow problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahuja et al., 1988)</ref>, the flow conservation constraints ∀v ∈ V \ {s, t} :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u:uv∈E y uv = w:vw∈E y vw = x v . (5)</formula><p>Constraining lifted edges. All the following constraints restrict values of lifted edge variables y vw in order to ensure that they satisfy (2). Despite their sometimes complex form, they always obey the two basic principles:</p><p>• If there is flow in G going from vertex v to vertex w, then y vw = 1. The constraints of this form are (8), (10).</p><p>• If there is a vw-cut in G with all edges labeled by zero (i.e. no flow passes through this cut), then y vw = 0. We will mainly look at cuts that are induced by paths, i.e. edges that separate a path from the rest of the graph. The paths of interest will either originate at v or end at w. The constraints of this form are (6), (7), (9), (11), (12).</p><p>Single node cut inequalities. Given a lifted edge vw ∈ E , if there is no flow going from vertex v which can potentially go to vertex w, then y vw = 0. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y vw ≤ u: vu∈E, uw∈R y vu .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Similarly, if there is no flow going to w that can originate from vertex v, then y vw = 0. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y vw ≤ u:uw∈E, vu∈R y uw .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The number of constraints of the above type (5) is linear in the number of vertices, while (6) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> are linear in the number of lifted edges. Hence we add them into our initial constraint set during optimization.</p><p>Path inequalities. For lifted edge y vw it holds that if there is a flow in G going from v to w along a path P , then y vw = 1. This constraint can be expressed by the following set of inequalities:</p><p>∀vw ∈ E ∀P ∈ vw-paths(G) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y vw ≥ vj:j∈P V y vj − i∈P V \{v,w} k / ∈P V y ik (8)</formula><p>Here the first sum expresses the flow going from v to any vertex of path P . The second sum is the flow leaving path vertices P V before reaching w. In other words, if flow does not leave P V , edge y vw must be active. Note that inequality (8) implicitly enforces y vw to be active if any path vw-pathP withP V ⊂ P V is active.</p><p>Remark 1. For the multicut problem, there exist path inequalities that enforce path properties in an analogous way. While the multicut path inequalities would yield the same set of feasible integral points, the resulting polyhedral relaxation would be weaker, see Proposition 3 in the Appendix.</p><p>Path-induced cut inequalities. The path-induced cut inequalities generalize the single node cut inequalities (6) and (7) by allowing cuts induced by paths.</p><p>Let a lifted edge vw ∈ E , a node u from which w is reachable and a vu-path P be given. Consider the cut given by edges ik with i ∈ P V and k / ∈ P V but such that w is reachable from k. If the flow does not take any edge of this cut, then y vw = 0. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∀vw ∈ E ∀P ∈ vu-paths(G) s.t. uw ∈ R ∧ u = w : y vw ≤ i∈P V k / ∈P V , kw∈R y ik .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Lifted inequalities. The path inequalities (8) and the pathinduced cut inequalities (9) only consider base edges on their right hand sides. We can generalize both (8) and (9) by including lifted edges in the paths as well. Conceptually, using lifted edges allows to represent all possible paths between their endpoints, which enables to formulate tighter inequalities, see Propositions 1 and 2.</p><p>To that end consider the multigraph G ∪ G := (V, E ∪ E ).</p><p>For any edge ij ∈ E ∩ E we always distinguish whether ij ∈ E or ij ∈ E . For P ∈ vw-paths(G ∪ G ), we denote by P E and P E edges of the path P in E and E respectively. We require P E ∩ P E = ∅.</p><p>Lifted path inequalities. We generalize the path inequalities (8). Now the vw-path P may contain both edges in E and E . Whenever a lifted edge y ij in the third sum in (10) is one, two cases can occur: (i) Flow goes out of P (uses vertices not in P V ) but reenters it again later. Then a base edge variable y ik will be one in the second sum in (10) and the values of y ij and y ik cancel out. (ii) A base edge ij ∈ E ∩ E parallel to the lifted edge is active. Then the variable y ij in the fourth sum in (10) cancels out y ij . The lifted path inequality becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∀vw ∈ E ∀P ∈ vw-paths(G ∪ G ) : y vw ≥ j∈P V y vj − i∈P V \{v,w} k / ∈P V y ik + ij∈P E y ij − ij∈P E ∩E y ij .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Whenever the path in (10) consists only of base edges P E , the resulting inequality becomes a path inequality (8).</p><p>Proposition 1. The lifted path inequalities (10) provide a strictly better relaxation than the path inequalities (8).</p><p>Lifted path-induced cut inequalities. We generalize the path-induced cut inequalities (9). Let a lifted edge vw ∈ E and a vu-path P in G ∪ G be given. In contrast to the basic version (9), a lifted edge ij ∈ P E can be taken. This can occur in two cases: Either the flow leaves P V via a base edge ik, k / ∈ P V or a base edge ij ∈ E ∩ E parallel to the lifted edge is taken. Both cases are accounted for by terms in the first and the third sum in (11) below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∀vw ∈ E ∀P ∈ vu-paths(G ∪ G ) s.t. uw ∈ R ∧ u = w : y vw ≤ i∈P V k / ∈P V , kw∈R y ik − ij∈P E y ij + ij∈P E ∩E y ij (11)</formula><p>Assume that the last node u of path P is connected via a lifted edge with w. Then we can strengthen (11) by replac-ing the sum of base edges outgoing from u by y uw .</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∀vw ∈ E ∀P ∈ vu-paths (G ∪ G ) s.t. uw ∈ E : y vw ≤ i∈P V \u k / ∈P V , kw∈R y ik − ij∈P E y ij + ij∈P E ∩E y ij + y uw<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Proposition 2. The lifted path-induced cut inequalities (11) define a strictly tighter relaxation than the path-induced cut inequalities (9).</p><p>Furthermore the lifted path-induced cut inequalities <ref type="formula">(11)</ref> and (12) define a strictly better relaxation than (11) alone.</p><p>Symmetric cut inequalities. Inequalities <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> provide a symmetric counterpart to inequalities (6). We can also formulate symmetric counterparts to inequalities <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(9)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(11)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(12)</ref> by swapping the role of v and w. All constraints <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(9)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(11)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(12)</ref> concentrate on paths originating in v. The symmetric inequalities are obtained by studying all paths ending in w. These symmetric inequalities are described in Appendix Section 10.2. Relations analogous to those described in Proposition 2 hold for the symmetric counterparts as well. The symmetric inequalities also strengthen the relaxation strictly. For the exact statements, see propositions in Appendix Section 10.2.</p></div>

More details about our experiments are provided in Appendix, Section ??.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Graph Construction.</head><p>Two-step procedure. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, we cannot solve entire video sequences straightforwardly. In order to make the problem tractable, we apply the following two-step procedure. In the first step, the solver is applied on graphs over person detections but only for small time intervals consisting of a few dozen video frames. The tracks resulting from the first step are used for extracting tracklets. In the second step, the solver is applied on newly created graphs G and G where vertices correspond to the obtained tracklets. Edges and edge costs between tracklets are obtained by aggregating original edges resp. edge costs between person detections. The tracks resulting from the second step may be suboptimal with respect to the original objective function defined over person detections. Therefore, we identify points where splitting a track leads to an improvement of the original objective value and extract new tracklets from the divided tracks. Multiple iterations of the second step are performed until no improving split points are found in the output tracks. This two-step procedure improves the objective w.r.t. the original objective (3) in every iteration. Since there are only finitely many trackings, the procedure terminates finitely. In practice, only a few iterations are necessary.</p><p>Graph sparsification. For our experiments, we use edges between detections up to 2sec temporal distance. These long range edges cause high computational complexity for the first step. In order to reduce it, we apply sparsification on both base and lifted graphs. For the base edges, we select for every v ∈ V its K nearest (lowest-cost) neighbors from every subsequent time frame within an allowed time gap. Lifted edges with costs close to zero are not included, since they are not discriminative. Lifted edges connecting detections with high time gap are included more sparsely than lifted edges having lower time gaps. We use dense graphs in the second step.</p><p>Costs. Initially, in the first step, we set ω v = 0 for all vertices v ∈ V . For the second step, where V represents tracklets, ω v is set to the cost of outputting tracklet v as a final trajectory. Specifically, ω v is the sum of costs of base edges between consecutive detections in the tracklet and the cost of lifted edges between all pairs of detections contained in the tracklet. The cost of a base edge between two tracklets is given by the cost of the original base edge connecting the last detection in the first tracklet with the first detection in the subsequent tracklet. The cost of a lifted edge between two tracklets is obtained by summing up the costs of original lifted edges between detections contained in the tracklets. This ensures that the costs of the tracklet solution corresponds to the costs of the original problem. We set cost of all edges from the source node s and to the sink node t to zero. Setting of detection costs and in/out costs to zero reduces the number of hyperparameters that usually needs to be incorporated by other methods. Moreover, our method does not include temporal decay of edge costs since the formulation directly prefers short range base edges over the long range ones.</p></div>

Given a set of input detections derived from a detector, we follow the approach of (Bergmann et al., 2019), a leading tracker for the MOT challenge, to reject false positive detections and to correct misaligned ones. For this, each input detection is send through the regression and classification part of their detector. In more detail, all tracking parts involved in the tracker Tracktor <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref> are deactivated, such that it only reshapes and eventually rejects input detections, without assigning labels to them.

Even if all input detections have been assigned to the correct identities by our solver, there might still be missing detections in case that a person has not been detected in some frames. We recover missing detections within the time range of a trajectory, which we denote as interpolation. Further, we extend a trajectory in forward and backward directions, which we denote as extrapolation. To this end, we follow <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref> and apply their object detector to recover missing positions based on the visual information at the last known position. Finally, for sequences filmed from a static camera, we perform linear interpolation on the remaining gaps.

In addition, we measure for all points in a given subbox whether their matched endpoints are in the corresponding subbox again or not. This gives two additional error measures for deviation in x and y-directions. Thus, in total we obtain a feature vector f DM (e) ∈ [0, 1] 8 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Experiment Setup</head><p>In order to assess the suitability of the proposed lifted disjoint paths formulation for MOT, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks: MOT15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Leal-Taixé et al., 2015)</ref>, MOT16 and MOT17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Milan et al., 2016)</ref>, resulting in 39 test sequences. The sequences are filmed from static and moving cameras. While MOT16 and MOT17 share the same sequences, MOT17 provides three different detectors in order to study the dependence of the tracking quality on the input detections. We perform analysis and parameter tuning for our tracker on the MOT17 train set, even when our tracker is applied to the MOT15 sequences to ensure that our tracker is not prone to overfitting. We follow the MOT challenge protocol and use the detections provided by the respective benchmarks. All experiments on the training set are evaluated using a leave-one-out crossvalidation. This includes all of our training procedures, in particular also the training of the re-identification network.</p><p>To measure the tracking quality, the multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) <ref type="bibr">(Bernardin &amp; Stiefelhagen, 2008)</ref> and the IDF1 metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ristani et al., 2016)</ref> are regarded as the most meaningful ones. The first incorporates the number of false negatives (FN), false positives (FP) and identity switches (IDS), thereby focusing on the coverage of persons. The latter assesses the consistency w.r.t. identities. Further tracking metrics (MT, ML) are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Li et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.">Benefit of Long Range Edges</head><p>We investigate the importance of using long range information for MOT. To this end, we apply our proposed tracker on the MOT17 training sequence with varying maximal time gap, for which base and lifted edges are created between nodes. In order to assess the influence of the time gap on the tracking quality, we measure the assignment quality in terms of the MOTA and IDF1 metrics, without performing any inter-or extrapolation. To assess how well the assignment part is solved by our tracker, we compute the maximum achievable metrics given the filtered input detections and admissible assignment hypotheses within maximal time gaps. A detailed description of how we obtain the optimal assignments are given in the appendix in Section 10.6. From the result in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we see essentialy constant MOTA scores. This is due the fact that selecting correct connections does not change MOTA significantly except after inter-and extrapolation (which we have excluded in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). However, we see a significant improvement in the IDF1 score, which directly penalizes wrong connections. Here, long range edges help greatly. Moreover, both metrics, ID precision and ID recall, clearly increase with increasing time gap. This shows that improvements by incorporating more temporal information come from using longer skip edges (impact on IDR) but most importantly, precision increases greatly. This means that ID switches are avoided thanks to lifted edges. Furthermore, the experiment shows that our designed features together with the lifted disjoint paths formulation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sadeghian et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, we compare the results to our tracker Lif_TsimInt that uses only a simple interpolation method (linear interpolation) as post-processing in all sequences. We outperform competing solvers on most metrics on all three MOT Challenge benchmarks, using Lif_T and Lif_TsimInt. Arrows indicate whether low or high metric values are better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.">Benchmark Evaluations</head><p>Finally, we compare our tracking performance on the MOT15, MOT16 and MOT17 benchmarks with all trackers listed on the MOTChallenge which have been peer-reviewed and correspond to published work. The three benchmark datasets consist of 11/7/7 training and test sequences for MOT15/16/17 respectively. They are the standard benchmark datasets for MOT. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> show the tracking performance of our tracker together with the best 5 performing trackers, accumulated over all sequences of the respective benchmarks. The evaluations show that we outperform all tracking systems by a large margin on all considered benchmarks. On MOT17, we improve the MOTA score from 53.5 to 60.5 and the IDF1 score from 52.3 to 65.6, which corresponds to an improvement of 13% in terms of MOTA and almost 25% in terms of the IDF1 score, indicating the effectiveness of the lifted edges. We observe similar improvements across all three benchmarks. These results reflect the near-optimal assignment performance observed on the MOT17 train set in Sect. 7.5. Finally, using only simple linear interpolation as post-processing (Lif_TsimInt), our tracker achieves 58.2 MOTA and 65.2 IDF1. Even then, our system clearly outperforms existing tracking systems. On average, the ILP solver needs 26.6 min. per sequence. Detailed runtimes are available in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> in Appendix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.6.">Optimal data association</head><p>The experiment of Section 7.5 compares the assignments of our tracking system with the optimal assignments. We elaborate on the details to obtain the optimal assignments. We start with the pre-processed input detections, according to Section 7.2. For each frame, we compute the intersection over union between the detections and ground-truth boxes of the respective frame, which forms a weighted bipartite graph. Edges with a corresponding intersection over union below 0.5 are removed. Then, we use Hungarian matching to find a maximum-weight matching. Unmatched detections are considered as false positives, while matched detections are assigned the corresponding ground-truth label. Thus, we obtain the trajectories on the input detections using the optimal assignment. Finally, depending on the time threshold of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, trajectories are synthetically splitted at skip-edges longer than the specified threshold.</p><p>10.7. Ablation study on post-processing methods.</p><p>Solving the proposed lifted disjoint paths problem establishes the assignment of input detections to object identities very close to the best possible assignment (Section 7.5).</p><p>To localize tracked objects also in the frames in which the object detector failed to detect them, some trackers apply an additional object detector on these frames based on the available input detections. This can be seen as performing interpolation and extrapolation, if viewed from the perspective of data association in a tracking-by-detection framework, e.g. see <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref>. As a result, improvements can be achieved from extending trajectories to image areas without input detections by applying of a very accurate object detector.</p><p>In order to make our tracking performance comparable with other trackers, we follow this strategy and employ an interand extrapolation based on <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Ablation study on inter-and extrapolation, evaluated on the MOT17 train set. SI = spatial interpolation only on sequences filmed from a static camera, SI * = spatial interpolation on all sequences, VI = visual interpolation, VE = visual extrapolation. Assignment and assignment (optimal) denote the results of the lifted disjoint paths problem and the optimal assignment, as reported in Section 7.5 given 2s time gap. Note that Tracktor's object detector is fine-tuned on MOT17Det. In our experiments, this resulted in bigger improvements on the MOT17 training set than on the test set, compare <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports the influence of employing inter-and extrapolation. The first two rows repeat values from <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> given the maximal 2s time gap. Since our solver produces nearly optimal data assignemt with respect to the used input detections, further improvements can only be achieved by applying interpolation and extrapolation on the tracks obtained by the solver.</p><p>We compare the visual interpolation (VI) as well as visual extrapolation (VE), both using the method of (Bergmann et al., 2019) with spatial interpolation (SI). For SI, we employ linear interpolation based solely on the geometric bounding box information.</p><p>The interpolation SI is applied only to sequences with a fixed camera in order to guarantee robust approximations. Still, the improvements by Assignment+SI over the baseline is evident. Especially the MOTA metric, which measures mainly the coverage of objects by detections, improves by about 10%. We also evaluate spatial interpolation for all sequences (SI * ), which improves the tracker further to 59.5 MOTA and 68.9 IDF1. However, performing spatial interpolation on sequences with moving cameras can lead to error propagation. Thus, our final tracker Lif_T relies on the more robust visual interpolation and employs spatial interpolation only on sequences filmed from a static camera.</p><p>On the contrary, the visual interpolation based on <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref> can be applied robustly to all sequences, but only in situations where the object is visible. Accordingly, the method Assignment+VI further improves over the baseline, as it is applied to more frames.</p><p>Recovering the position of tracked objects also outside of the time range of its computed trajectory (Assignment+VI+VE) further helps to improve the tracking accuracy, enhancing MOTA by about 20% and IDF1 by about 10% IDF1, as VE extends computed trajectory thereby achieving longer identity consistencies.</p><p>Finally, we employ spatial interpolation on the remaining cases where detections are missing and the objects are fully occluded (Assignment+VI+VE+SI) resulting in a slight improvement over Assignment+VI+VE.</p><p>Note that we use the method Assignment+VI+VE+SI to evaluate our tracker on the MOT15, MOT16 and MOT17 test set, as reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The impact of the postprocessing on the training set using Tracktor seems to be very high. We conjectured this might be due to the fact that Tracktor's object detector is trained on MOT17Det (which are the detections of MOT17), leading to some degree of overfitting. Note that Tracktor is not trained the MOT17 tracking ground truth, so that it is still regarded as a meaningful validation procedure <ref type="bibr">(Bergmann et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, we created another tracker Lif_TsimInt that uses a simple interpolation, namely only linear interpolation between detections of a trajectory, for all sequences. The tracker thus corresponds to Assignment+SI * . Comparing <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> with <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, we see that indeed, the impact of the post-processing on the test set is significantly lower. We conclude that while the post-processing improves the tracking performance, the main performance of our tracker is due to our contributions.</p><p>Recall that most offline tracking systems obtain trajectories by solving a data association problem, e.g. <ref type="bibr">(Henschel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Tang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ristani &amp; Tomasi, 2018</ref>). Our proposed tracker is able to achieve near-optimal results with respect to the input detections. Applying interpolation and extrapolation further improves the results, and makes it conceptually comparable to Tracktor. Still, with postprocessing on our computed data-association, we improve over Tracktor by 25%. We argue that solving the data association accurately is important to obtain a final high-quality result after post-processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.8.">Further Details on the Feature Fusion Network.</head><p>We discuss in detail the neural network which fuses the input features, thereby extending Section 7.3.</p><p>Architecture of the fusion network. Considering one assignment hypothesis represented by an edge e = vw, the DeepMatching densities ρ ∈ [0, 1] 6 as well the temporal distance t between the corresponding detections v and w serve as a confidence score for the remaining input features. They describe which of the input features is a reliable metric for a given assignment hypothesis, but they are not giving any information about the correctness of the assignment hypothesis. We transform the density features non-linearly and denote them together with the temporal distance as control features C(e) := (log(ρ), t) ∈ R 6 × [0, 2]. The remaining features described in Section 7.3 are denoted as F(e) ∈ [0, 1] n .</p><p>One plausible architecture is to use a convex combination of the input features, such that the coefficients depend on the control features. To this end, let α i (C(e), W αi ) for i = 1, · · · , n denote a neural network with the control features as input and W αi as learnable weights. Further, let β i (F(e) i , W βi ) for i = 1, · · · , n be a neural network applied to i-th feature of F(e), with learnable weights W βi .</p><p>The input features and control features can then be fused via n i=1 α i (C(e), W αi )β i (F(e) i , W βi ),</p><p>such that n i=1 α i (C(e), W αi ) = 1.</p><p>To ensure stable training, (23) should be applied to a sigmoid function and trained using binary cross-entropy loss.</p><p>Nonetheless, our tracker implementation employs neural network based mainly on a combination of relu units and fully connected layers, which performed slightly better, still sharing the idea of seperating the input into control features and input features. The detailed architecture is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 11</ref>.</p><p>Training details. Training of the neural network is performed directly on the (preprocessed) input detections. Labels are retrieved by assigning each detection to the best fitting ground-truth bounding box. Detections with ambiguous assignments are ignored within the training phase.</p><p>In order to train the edge classifier, special care has to be taken as the training set is highly imbalanced. The number of edges which correspond to true negatives (pairs of detections which do not belong to the same person) clearly dominates the number of true positive edges (pairs of detections belonging to the same person).</p><p>To address this issue, the network is trained on a randomly sampled subset of all possible edges, such that the ratio of true positive edges and true negative edges per time distance between the end nodes of the edges remains fixed. The maximal temporal distance of an edge is set to 2 seconds, allowing to recover persons even after long occlusions.</p><p>The weights of the fusion network are optimized according to the binary cross-entropy loss. We employ stochastic gradient descent with the learning rate set to 10 −2 and Nesterov momentum set to 0.9, for a total of 10 epochs. Training and inference is performed using Pytorch 1.3 on a Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti.</p><p>Accuracy of the fusion network. The performance of a tracking system depends highly on the accuracy of the edge classifier (and the corresponding edge weights).</p><p>Therefore, we report our evaluation of the edge classifier on all training sequences of the filtered MOT17 train set in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Together with <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, it shows that improvements in the tracking features directly correlate to high quality tracking results thanks to the proposed solver. While <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows very good performance of the edge classifier, a powerful graph model and solver is still crucial to obtain high quality tracking results. Even small errors (we observed 5% maximal error) in the edge classifier can cause many errors in the tracking results if an unsuitable procedure is used. Also note that for training the edge classifier, detections with ambiguous assignment to the ground truth boxes were ignored. So, these potentially difficult cases are excluded int the evaluation of the edge classifier. Especially the interpolation and extrapolation is prone to error propagation, once a single identity switch has been created, which heavily affects, among others, the IDF1 score.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Performance metrics on the edge classifier. The performance is measured in terms of the accuracy (Acc), precision (Prec), true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR). The arrows indicate that higher metric values are better. disjoint paths formulation can be advantageous, since lifted edges aggregate multiple edge classifiers which can correct individual wrong classifications of single edges.</p></div>

In particular, the detections are not rejected, reshaped, neither are their labels changed by Tracktor. Instead, we apply Tracktor to recover further locations of an object in the frames where detections of the object were missing. The procedure is based on its trajectory obtained from the lifted disjoint paths solver. Note that our adaption ignores additional, unassigned input detections, whereas the original implementation(Bergmann et al., 2019)  of Tracktor fuses the detections coming from Tracktor's detector with detections provided by the dataset.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Method</cell><cell cols="2">MOTA IDF1</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment</cell><cell>52.8</cell><cell>64.3</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment (optimal)</cell><cell>53.4</cell><cell>66.8</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment+SI</cell><cell>57.8</cell><cell>67.6</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment+SI  *</cell><cell>59.5</cell><cell>68.9</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment+VI</cell><cell>59.6</cell><cell>68.5</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment+VI+VE</cell><cell>65.7</cell><cell>71.5</cell></row><row><cell>Assignment+VI+VE+SI</cell><cell>67.0</cell><cell>72.4</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
