<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Face detection and alignment in unconstrained environment is always deployed on edge devices which have limited memory storage and low computing power. This paper proposes a one-stage method named CenterFace to simultaneously predict facial box and landmark location with real-time speed and high accuracy.</p><p>The proposed method also belongs to the anchor free category. This is achieved by: (a) learning face existing possibility by the semantic maps, (b) learning bounding box, offsets and five landmarks for each position that potentially contains a face. Specifically, the method can run in real-time on a single CPU core and 200 FPS using NVIDIA 2080TI for VGA-resolution images, and can simultaneously achieve superior accuracy (WIDER FACE Val/Test-Easy: 0.935/0.932, Medium: 0.924/0.921, Hard: 0.875/0.873 and FDDB discontinuous: 0.980, continuous: 0.732). A demo of CenterFace can be available at https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Face detection and alignment is one of the fundamental issues in computer vision and pattern recognition, and is often deployed in mobile and embedded devices. These devices typically have limited memory storage and low computing power. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the position of the face box and the landmark at the same time, and it is excellent in speed and precision.</p><p>With the great breakthrough of convolutional neural networks(CNN), face detection has recently achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Previous face detection methods have inherited the paradigm of anchor-based generic object detection frameworks, which can be divided into two categories: two-stage method ) and one-stage method (SSD [17]). Compared with two-stage method, the one-stage method is are more efficient and has higher recall rate, but it tends to achieve a higher false positive rate and to compromise the localization accuracy. Then Hu et al. [7] used a two-stage approach to the Region Proposal Networks (RPN) [15] to detect faces directly, while SSH [8] and S3FD [10] developed a scale-invariant network in a single network to detect faces with mutil-scale from different layers.</p><p>The previous anchor-based methods have some drawbacks. On the one hand, in order to improve the overlap between anchor boxes and ground truth, a face detector usually requires a large number of dense anchors to achieve a good recall rate. For example, more than 100k anchor boxes in RetinaFace [11] for a 640×640 input image. On the other hand, the anchor is a hyperparameter design that is statistically calculated from a particular data set, so it is not always feasible to other applications, which goes against the generality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In addition, the current state of the art FACE detectors has achieved considerable accuracy on the benchmark WIDER FACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by using heavy pretrained backbones such as VGG16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and resnet50/152 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. First, these detectors are difficult to use in practice because the network consumes too much time and the model size is also too large. Secondly, it is not convenient for face recognition application without facial landmark prediction. Therefore, joint detection and alignment, as well as better balance of accuracy and latency, are essential for practical applications.</p><p>Inspired by the anchor free universal object detection framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, this paper proposes a simpler and more effective face detection and alignment method named CenterFace, which is only lightweight but also powerful. The network structure about the CenterFace is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, which can be trained end-to-end.</p><p>We use the center point of the face's bounding box to represent the face, then facial box size and landmark are regressed directly to image features at the center location. So face detection and alignment are transformed to the standard key point estimation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The peak in the heat map corresponds to the center of the face.</p><p>The image features at each peak predict the size of the face and the face key points. This approach was fully evaluated and the latest detection performance were shown on a number of benchmark data sets for face detection, including FDDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and WIDER FACE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Architecture of the CenterFace</head><p>In summary, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as four-fold: -By introducing the anchor free design, face detection is transformed into a standard key point estimation problem, using only a larger output resolution (output stride is 4) compared to previous detectors.</p><p>-Based on the multi-task learning strategy, the face as point design is proposed to predict the face boxes and five key points at the same time.</p><p>-This paper proposes a feature pyramid network using common Layer for accurate and fast face detection.</p><p>-Comprehensive experimental results based on popular benchmarks FDDB and WIDER FACE, as well as CPU and GPU hardware platforms, have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in terms of speed and accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cascaded CNN methods</head><p>The method of cascade convolutional neural network (CNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> uses cascaded CNN framework to learn features in order to improve the performance and maintain efficiency. However, there are some problems about cascaded CNN based detector: 1) The runtime of these detector is negatively correlated with the number of faces on the input image. The speed will dramatically degrade when the number of faces increases; 2) Because these methods optimize each module separately, the training process becomes extremely complicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Anchor methods</head><p>Inspired by generic object detection methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, which embraced all the recent advancement in deep learning, face detection has recently achieved remarkable progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Different from generic object detection, the ratio of face scale is usually from 1:1 to 1:1.5. The latest methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> focus on single stage design, which densely samples face locations and scales on feature pyramids, demonstrating promising performance and yielding faster speed compared to two-stage methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Anchor free methods</head><p>In our view, Cascaded CNN methods are also a kind of anchor free methods. However, this method uses sliding window to detect human faces and relies on image pyramids. It has some shortcomings such as slow speed and complex training process. LFFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> regards the RFs as natural anchors which can cover continuous face scales, which is just another way to define anchor, but the training time is about 5 days with two NVIDIA GTX1080TI. Our CenterFace simply represents faces by a single point at their bounding box center, then facial box size and landmark are regressed directly from image features at the center location. Thus face detection is transformed into a standard key point estimation problem. And the training time of a NVIDIA GTX2080TI is only one day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Multitask Learning</head><p>Multitask learning uses multiple supervisory labels to improve the accuracy of each task by utilizing the correlation between tasks. Joint face detection and alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> is widely used because alignment task，paralleling with the backbone, provides better features for face classification task with face point information. Similarly, Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> significantly improves the detection performance by adding a branch for predicting an object mask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CenterFace</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Mobile Feature Pyramid Network</head><p>We adopted Mobilenetv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> as the backbone and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> as the neck for the subsequent detection. In general, FPN uses a top-down architecture with lateral connections to build a feature pyramid from a single scale input. CenterFace represents the face through the center point of face box, and face size and facial landmark are then regressed directly from image features of the center location. Therefore only one layer in the pyramid is used for face detection and alignment. We construct a pyramid with levels {P-L}, L = 3, 4, 5, where L indicates pyramid level. Pl has 1/2 L resolution of the input. All pyramid levels have C = 24 channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Face as Point</head><p>Let [x 1 , y 1 , x 2 , y 2 ] be the bounding box of face. Facial center point lies at c = [(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 + x 2 )/2, (y 1 + y 2 )/2]. Let I∈ R W×H×3</formula><p>be an input image of width W and height H. Our aim is to produce the heatmap Y∈[0, 1] W/R × H/R , where R is the output stride. We use the default output stride of R = 4 in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A prediction Yˆx,y = 1 corresponds to a face center, while Yˆx,y = 0 is background.</p><p>The face classification branch is trained following Law and Deng <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For each ground truth. We calculate the equivalent heat map by using Gaussian kernel to represent the ground truth.The training loss is a variant of focal loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: To gather global information and to reduce memory usage, downsampling is applied to an image convolutionally, the size of the output is usually smaller than the image. Hence, a location (x, y) in the image is mapped to the location (x/n, y/n) in the heatmaps, where n is the downsampling factor. When we remap the locations from the heatmaps to the input image, some pixel may be not alignment, which can greatly affect the accuracy of facial boxes. To address this issue, we predict position offsets to adjust the center position slightly before remapping the center position to the input resolution：</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) 1 ( ) 1 log( ) ( ) 1 ( - 1 ) log( ) 1 ( - L c      − − = − = otherwise Y Y Y Y if Y Y xyc</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">) 2 ( ) , (       −       − = n y n y n x n x o k k k k k</formula><p>where o k is the offset, x k and y k are the x and y coordinate for face center k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Box and Landmark Prediction</head><p>To reduce the computational burden, we use a single size prediction S∈R W/4*H/4 for facial box and landmarks.</p><p>Each ground-truth bounding box is specified as G = <ref type="figure">(x1, y1, x2, y2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Training Details</head><p>Dataset. The proposed method is trained on the training set of WIDER FACE benchmark, including 12,880 images with more than 150,000 valid faces in scale, pose, expression, occlusion and illumination. RetinaFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduces five levels of face image quality and annotates five landmarks on faces.</p><p>Data augmentation. Data augmentation is important to improve the generalization. We use random flip, random scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, color jittering and randomly crop square patches from the original images and resize these patches into 800*800 to generate larger training faces. Faces that are less than 8 pixels are discarded directly.</p><p>Training parameters. We train the CenterFace using Adam optimiser with a batch-size 8 and learning rate 5e-4 for 140 epochs, with learning rate dropped 10× at 90 and 120 epochs, respectively. The down-sampling layers of MobilenetV2 are initialized with ImageNet pretrain and the up-sampling layers are randomly initialized. The training time is about one day with one NVIDIA GTX2080TI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we firstly introduce the runtime efficiency of CenterFace, then evaluate it on the common face detection benchmarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Running Efficiency</head><p>The existing CNN face detectors can be accelerated by GPUs, but they are not fast enough in most practical applications, especially CPU based applications. As described below, our CenterFace is efficient enough to meet practical requirements and its model size is only 7.2MB. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, comparing with other detectors, our method can exceed the real-time running speed (&gt; 100 FPS) at different resolutions by using a single NVIDIA GTX2080TI.</p><p>Owing to the DSFD, PyramidBox, S3FD and SSH are too slow when running on CPU platforms, we only evaluate the proposed CenterFace, FaceBoxes, MTCNN and CasCNN at VGA-resolution images on CPU and the mAP means the true positive rate at 1000 false positives on FDDB. As listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, our CenterFace can run at 30 FPS on the CPU with state-of-the-art accuracy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation on Benchmarks</head><p>FDDB dataset. FDDB contains 2845 images with 5171 unconstrained faces collected from the Yahoo news website. We evaluate our face detector on FDDB against the other state-of-art methods and the results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, respectively. We also add DFSD, PyramidBox and S3FD detectors. Whereas, these detectors are much slower due to the larger backbone and denser anchors. Our CenterFace can also achieve good performance on both discontinuous and continuous ROC curves, i.e. 98.0% and 72.9% when the number of false positives equals to 1,000 and it outperforms LFFD, FaceBoxes and MTCNN evidently. follow the standard practices of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and employ flip as well as multi-scale strategies. Box voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is applied on the union set of predicted face boxes using an IoU threshold at 0.4. We report the results on the validation and testing sets in <ref type="table">Tables 4 and 5</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduces the CenterFace that has the superiority of the proposed method perform well on both speed and accuracy and simultaneously predicts facial box and landmark location. Our proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of the previous anchor based method by translating face detection and alignment into a standard key point estimation problem. CenterFace represents the face through the center point of face box, and face size and facial landmark are then regressed directly from image features of the center location. Comprehensive and extensive experiments are made to fully analyze the proposed method. The final results demonstrate that our method can achieve real-time speed and high accuracy with a smaller model size, making it an ideal alternative for most face detection and alignment applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>β are hyper-parameters of the focal loss, which are designated as α = 2 and β = 4 in all our experiments.</figDesc></figure>
