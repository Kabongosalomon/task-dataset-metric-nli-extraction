<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of document summarization has two main paradigms: extractive and abstractive. The former method directly chooses and outputs the salient sentences (or phrases) in the original document <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jing and McKeown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Knight and Marcu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martins and Smith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011)</ref>. The latter abstractive approach involves rewriting the summary <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Banko et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zajic et al., 2004)</ref>, and has seen substantial recent gains due to neural sequence-to-sequence models <ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Paulus et al., 2018)</ref>. Abstractive models can be more concise by performing generation from scratch, but they suffer from slow and inaccurate encoding of very long documents, with the attention model being required to look at all encoded words (in long paragraphs) for decoding each generated summary word (slow, one by one sequentially). Abstractive models also suffer from redundancy (repetitions), especially when generating multi-sentence summary.</p><p>To address both these issues and combine the advantages of both paradigms, we propose a hybrid extractive-abstractive architecture, with policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) to bridge together the two networks. Similar to how humans summarize long documents, our model first uses an extractor agent to select salient sentences or highlights, and then employs an abstractor network to rewrite (i.e., compress and paraphrase) each of these extracted sentences. To overcome the non-differentiable behavior of our extractor and train on available document-summary pairs without saliency label, we next use actorcritic policy gradient with sentence-level metric rewards to connect these two neural networks and to learn sentence saliency. We also avoid common language fluency issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Paulus et al., 2018)</ref> by preventing the policy gradients from affecting the abstractive summarizer's word-level training, which is supported by our human evaluation study. Our sentence-level reinforcement learning takes into account the word-sentence hierarchy, which better models the language structure and makes parallelization possible. Our extractor combines reinforcement learning and pointer networks, which is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bello et al. (2017)</ref>'s attempt to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. Our abstractor is a simple encoder-aligner-decoder model (with copying) and is trained on pseudo document-summary sentence pairs obtained via simple automatic matching criteria.</p><p>Thus, our method incorporates the abstractive paradigm's advantages of concisely rewriting sentences and generating novel words from the full vocabulary, yet it adopts intermediate extractive behavior to improve the overall model's quality, speed, and stability. Instead of encoding and attending to every word in the long input document sequentially, our model adopts a human-inspired coarse-to-fine approach that first extracts all the salient sentences and then decodes (rewrites) them (in parallel). This also avoids almost all redundancy issues because the model has already chosen non-redundant salient sentences to abstractively summarize (but adding an optional final reranker component does give additional gains by removing the fewer across-sentence repetitions).</p><p>Empirically, our approach is the new state-ofthe-art on all ROUGE metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lin, 2004)</ref> as well as on METEOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Denkowski and Lavie, 2014)</ref> of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, achieving statistically significant improvements over previous models that use complex long-encoder, copy, and coverage mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(See et al., 2017)</ref>. The test-only DUC-2002 improvement also shows our model's better generalization than this strong abstractive system. In addition, we surpass the popular lead-3 baseline on all ROUGE scores with an abstractive model. Moreover, our sentence-level abstractive rewriting module also produces substantially more (3x) novel N -grams that are not seen in the input document, as compared to the strong flat-structured model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref>. This empirically justifies that our RL-guided extractor has learned sentence saliency, rather than benefiting from simply copying longer sentences. We also show that our model maintains the same level of fluency as a conventional RNN-based model because the reward does not leak to our abstractor's word-level training. Finally, our model's training is 4x and inference is more than 20x faster than the previous state-of-the-art. The optional final reranker gives further improvements while maintaining a 7x speedup.</p><p>Overall, our contribution is three fold: First we propose a novel sentence-level RL technique for the well-known task of abstractive summarization, effectively utilizing the word-then-sentence hierarchical structure without annotated matching sentence-pairs between the document and ground truth summary. Next, our model achieves the new state-of-the-art on all metrics of multiple versions of a popular summarization dataset (as well as a test-only dataset) both extractively and abstractively, without loss in language fluency (also demonstrated via human evaluation and abstractiveness scores). Finally, our parallel decoding results in a significant 10-20x speed-up over the previous best neural abstractive summarization system with even better accuracy. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>In this work, we consider the task of summarizing a given long text document into several (ordered) highlights, which are then combined to form a multi-sentence summary. Formally, given a training set of document-summary pairs</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{x i , y i } N i=1 , our goal is to approximate the func- tion h : X → Y, X = {x i } N i=1 , Y = {y i } N i=1 such that h(x i ) = y i , 1 ≤ i ≤ N .</formula><p>Furthermore, we assume there exists an abstracting function g defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∀s ∈ S i , ∃d ∈ D i such that g(d) = s, 1 ≤ i ≤ N ,</formula><p>where S i is the set of summary sentences in x i and D i the set of document sentences in y i . i.e., in any given pair of document and summary, every summary sentence can be produced from some document sentence. For simplicity, we omit subscript i in the remainder of the paper. Under this assumption, we can further define another latent function f : X → D n that satisfies f (x) = {d t } n j=1 and y = h(x) = [g(d 1 ), g(d 2 ), . . . , g(d n )], where [, ] denotes sentence concatenation. This latent function f can be seen as an extractor that chooses the salient (ordered) sentences in a given document for the abstracting function g to rewrite. Our overall model consists of these two submodules, the extractor agent and the abstractor network, to approximate the above-mentioned f and g, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Learning</head><p>Given that our extractor performs a nondifferentiable hard extraction, we apply standard policy gradient methods to bridge the backpropagation and form an end-to-end trainable (stochastic) computation graph. However, simply starting from a randomly initialized network to train the whole model in an end-to-end fashion is infeasible. When randomly initialized, the extractor would often select sentences that are not relevant, so it would be difficult for the abstractor to learn to abstractively rewrite. On the other hand, without a well-trained abstractor the extractor would get noisy reward, which leads to a bad estimate of the policy gradient and a sub-optimal policy. We hence propose optimizing each sub-module separately using maximumlikelihood (ML) objectives: train the extractor to select salient sentences (fit f ) and the abstractor to generate shortened summary (fit g). Finally, RL is applied to train the full model end-to-end (fit h).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Maximum-Likelihood Training for Submodules</head><p>Extractor Training: In Sec. 2.1.2, we have formulated our sentence selection as classification. However, most of the summarization datasets are end-to-end document-summary pairs without extraction (saliency) labels for each sentence. Hence, we propose a simple similarity method to provide a 'proxy' target label for the extractor.</p><p>Similar to the extractive model of Nallapati et al.</p><p>(2017), for each ground-truth summary sentence, we find the most similar document sentence d jt by: 4</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">j t = argmax i (ROUGE-L recall (d i , s t )) (6)</formula><p>Given these proxy training labels, the extractor is then trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Reinforce-Guided Extraction</head><p>Here we explain how policy gradient techniques are applied to optimize the whole model. To make the extractor an RL agent, we can formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) 5 : at each extraction step t, the agent observes the current state c t = (D, d j t−1 ), samples an action j t ∼ π θa,ω (c t , j) = P (j) from Eqn. 2 to extract a document sentence and receive a reward 6</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r(t + 1) = ROUGE-L F 1 (g(d jt ), s t )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>after the abstractor summarizes the extracted sentence d jt . We denote the trainable parameters of the extractor agent by θ = {θ a , ω} for the decoder and hierarchical encoder respectively. We can then train the extractor with policy-based RL. We illustrate this process in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. The vanilla policy gradient algorithm, REIN-FORCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Williams, 1992)</ref>, is known for high variance. To mitigate this problem, we add a critic network with trainable parameters θ c to predict the state-value function V π θa,ω (c). The predicted value of critic b θc,ω (c) is called the 'baseline', which is then used to estimate the advantage function: A π θ (c, j) = Q π θa,ω (c, j) − V π θa,ω (c) because the total return R t is an estimate of actionvalue function Q(c t , j t ). Instead of maximizing Q(c t , j t ) as done in REINFORCE, we maximize A π θ (c, j) with the following policy gradient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∇ θa,ω J(θ a , ω) = E[∇ θa,ω logπ θ (c, j)A π θ (c, j)]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>And the critic is trained to minimize the square loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L c (θ c , ω) = (b θc,ω (c t ) − R t ) 2</formula><p>. This is 5 Strictly speaking, this is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We approximate it as an MDP by assuming that the RNN hidden state contains all past info. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In Eqn. 6, we use ROUGE-recall because we want the extracted sentence to contain as much information as possible for rewriting. Nevertheless, for Eqn. 7, ROUGE-F1 is more suitable because the abstractor g is supposed to rewrite the extracted sentence d to be as concise as the ground truth s. known as the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), a synchronous variant of A3C <ref type="bibr">(Mnih et al., 2016)</ref>. For more A2C details, please refer to the supp.</p><p>Intuitively, our RL training works as follow: If the extractor chooses a good sentence, after the abstractor rewrites it the ROUGE match would be high and thus the action is encouraged. If a bad sentence is chosen, though the abstractor still produces a compressed version of it, the summary would not match the ground truth and the low ROUGE score discourages this action. Our RL with a sentence-level agent is a novel attempt in neural summarization. We use RL as a saliency guide without altering the abstractor's language model, while previous work applied RL on the word-level, which could be prone to gaming the metric at the cost of language fluency. 7</p><p>Learning how many sentences to extract: In a typical RL setting like game playing, an episode is usually terminated by the environment. On the other hand, in text summarization, the agent does not know in advance how many summary sentence to produce for a given article (since the desired length varies for different downstream applications). We make an important yet simple, intuitive adaptation to solve this: by adding a 'stop' action to the policy action space. In the RL training phase, we add another set of trainable parameters v EOE (EOE stands for 'End-Of-Extraction') with the same dimension as the sentence representation. The pointer-network decoder treats v EOE as one of the extraction candidates and hence naturally results in a stop action in the stochastic policy. We set the reward for the agent performing EOE to ROUGE-</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">1 F 1 ([{g(d jt )} t ], [{s t } t ])</formula><p>; whereas for any extraneous, unwanted extraction step, the agent receives zero reward. The model is therefore encouraged to extract when there are still remaining ground-truth summary sentences (to accumulate intermediate reward), and learn to stop by optimizing a global ROUGE and avoiding extra extraction. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Overall, this modification allows dy-7 During this RL training of the extractor, we keep the abstractor parameters fixed. Because the input sentences for the abstractor are extracted by an intermediate stochastic policy of the extractor, it is impossible to find the correct target summary for the abstractor to fit g with ML objective. Though it is possible to optimize the abstractor with RL, in out preliminary experiments we found that this does not improve the overall ROUGE, most likely because this RL optimizes at a sentence-level and can add across-sentence redundancy. We achieve SotA results without this abstractor-level RL. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We use ROUGE-1 for terminal reward because it is a better measure of bag-of-words information (i.e., has all the namic decisions of number-of-sentences based on the input document, eliminates the need for tuning a fixed number of steps, and enables a data-driven adaptation for any specific dataset/application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Repetition-Avoiding Reranking</head><p>Existing abstractive summarization systems on long documents suffer from generating repeating and redundant words and phrases. To mitigate this issue, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> propose the coverage mechanism and Paulus et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(2018)</ref> incorporate tri-gram avoidance during beam-search at testtime. Our model without these already performs well because the summary sentences are generated from mutually exclusive document sentences, which naturally avoids redundancy. However, we do get a small further boost to the summary quality by removing a few 'across-sentence' repetitions, via a simple reranking strategy: At sentence-level, we apply the same beam-search tri-gram avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Paulus et al., 2018)</ref>. We keep all k sentence candidates generated by beam search, where k is the size of the beam. Next, we then rerank all k n combinations of the n generated summary sentence beams. The summaries are reranked by the number of repeated N -grams, the smaller the better. We also apply the diverse decoding algorithm described in  (which has almost no computation overhead) so as to get the above approach to produce useful diverse reranking lists. We show how much the redundancy affects the summarization task in Sec. 6.2.</p></div>

(2018)</ref> used an extract-thensynthesis approach on QA, where an extraction model predicts the important spans in the passage and then another synthesis model generates the final answer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Swayamdipta et al. (2017)</ref> attempted cascaded non-recurrent small networks on extractive QA, resulting a scalable, parallelizable model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fan et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>Please refer to the supplementary for full training details (all hyperparameter tuning was performed on the validation set). We use the CNN/Daily Mail dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hermann et al., 2015)</ref> modified for summarization <ref type="bibr">(Nallapati et al., 2016)</ref>. Because there are two versions of the dataset, original text and entity anonymized, we show results on both versions of the dataset for a fair comparison to prior works. The experiment runs training and evaluation for each version separately. Despite the fact that the 2 versions have been considered separately by the summarization community as 2 different datasets, we use same hyper-parameter values for both dataset versions to show the generalization of our model. We also show improvements on the DUC-2002 dataset in a test-only setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>For all the datasets, we evaluate standard ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lin, 2004</ref>) on fulllength F 1 (with stemming) following previous works <ref type="bibr">(Nallapati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Paulus et al., 2018)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Modular Extractive vs. Abstractive</head><p>Our hybrid approach is capable of both extractive and abstractive (i.e., rewriting every sentence) summarization. The extractor alone performs extractive summarization. To investigate the effect of the recurrent extractor (rnn-ext), we implement a feed-forward extractive baseline ff-ext (details in supplementary). It is also possible to apply RL to extractor without using the abstractor (rnn-ext + RL). 9 Benefiting from the high modularity of our model, we can make our summarization system abstractive by simply applying the abstractor on the extracted sentences. Our abstractor rewrites each sentence and generates novel words from a large vocabulary, and hence every word in our overall summary is generated from scratch; making our full model categorized into the abstractive paradigm. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We run experiments on separately trained extractor/abstractor (ff-ext + abs, rnn-ext + abs) and the reinforced full model (rnn-ext + abs + RL) as well as the final reranking version (rnn-ext + abs + RL + rerank).</p></div>

Overall, our model achieves strong improvements and the new state-of-the-art on both extractive and abstractive settings for both versions of the CNN/DM dataset (with some comparable results on the anonymized version). Moreover, <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows the generalization of our abstractive system to an out-ofdomain test-only setup <ref type="bibr">(DUC-2002)</ref>, where our model achieves better scores than <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al.

(2017) and a strong lead-3 baseline. For producing our summary, we simply concatenate the extracted sentences from the extractors. From <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we can see that our feed-forward extractor out-performs the lead-3 baseline, empirically showing that our hierarchical sentence encoding model is capable of extracting salient sentences. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The reinforced extractor performs the best, because of the ability to get the summary-level reward and the reduced train-test mismatch of feeding the previous extraction decision. The improvement over lead-3 is consistent across both tables.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, it outperforms the previous best neural extractive model <ref type="bibr">(Nallapati et al., 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Abstractive Summarization</head><p>After applying the abstractor, the ff-ext based model still out-performs the rnn-ext model. Both combined models exceed the pointer-generator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(See et al., 2017)</ref> without coverage by a large margin for all metrics, showing the effectiveness of our 2-step hierarchical approach: our method naturally avoids repetition by extracting multiple sentences with different keypoints. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Moreover, after applying reinforcement learning, our model performs better than the best model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> and the best ML trained model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Paulus et al. (2018)</ref>. Our reinforced model outperforms the ML trained rnn-ext + abs baseline with statistical significance of p &lt; 0.01 on all metrics for both version of the dataset, indicating the effectiveness of the RL training. Also, rnn-ext + abs + RL is statistically significant better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> for all metrics with p &lt; 0.01. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In the supplementary, we show the learning curve of our RL training, where the average reward goes up quickly after the extractor learns the End-of-Extract action and then stabilizes. For all the above models, we use standard greedy decoding and find that it performs well.</p><p>Reranking and Redundancy Although the extract-then-abstract approach inherently will not generate repeating sentences like other neuraldecoders do, there might still be across-sentence redundancy because the abstractor is not aware of other extracted sentences when decoding one. Hence, we incorporate an optional reranking strategy described in Sec. 3.3. The improved ROUGE scores indicate that this successfully removes some remaining redundancies and hence produces more concise summaries. Our best abstractive 12 A trivial lead-3 + abs baseline obtains ROUGE of <ref type="bibr">(37.37, 15.59, 34.82)</ref>, which again confirms the importance of our reinforce-based sentence selection. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We calculate statistical significance based on the bootstrap test <ref type="bibr">(Noreen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994)</ref>    <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al.

Note that our best model is one of the first abstractive models to outperform the lead-3 baseline on the originaltext CNN/DM dataset. Our extractive experiment serves as a complementary analysis of the effect of RL with extractive systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Human Evaluation</head><p>We also conduct human evaluation to ensure robustness of our training procedure. We measure relevance and readability of the summaries. Relevance is based on the summary containing important, salient information from the input article, being correct by avoiding contradictory/unrelated information, and avoiding repeated/redundant information. Readability is based on the summarys fluency, grammaticality, and coherence. To evaluate both these criteria, we design the following Amazon MTurk experiment: we randomly select 100 samples from the CNN/DM test set and ask the human testers (3 for each sample) to rank between summaries (for relevance and readability) produced by our model and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> (the models were anonymized and randomly shuffled), i.e. A is better, B is better, both are equally good/bad.

In Table 5, we show the substantial test-time speed-up of our model compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> We calculate the total decoding time for producing all summaries for the test set. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Due to the fact that the main test-time speed bottleneck of RNN language generation model is that the model is constrained to generate one word at a time, the total decoding time is dependent on the number of total words generated; we hence also report the decoded words per second for a fair comparison. Our model without reranking is extremely fast. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> we can see that we achieve a speed up of 18x in time and 24x in word generation rate. Even after adding the (optional) reranker, we still maintain a 6-7x speed-up (and hence a user can choose to use the reranking component depending on their downstream application's speed requirements). 20 <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The only publicly available code with a pretrained model for neural summarization which we can test the speed. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The time needed for extractor is negligible w.r.t. the abstractor because it does not require large matrix multiplication for generating every word.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Abstractiveness</head><p>We compute an abstractiveness score <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(See et al., 2017)</ref> as the ratio of novel n-grams in the generated summary that are not present in the input document. The results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: our model rewrites substantially more abstractive summaries than previous work. A potential reason for this is that when trained with individual sentence-pairs, the abstractor learns to drop more document words so as to write individual summary sentences as concise as human-written ones; thus the improvement in multi-gram novelty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Qualitative Analysis on Output Examples</head><p>We show examples of how our best model selects sentences and then rewrites them. In the supplementary <ref type="figure">Fig. 4 and Fig. 5</ref>, we can see how the abstractor rewrites the extracted sentences concisely while keeping the mentioned facts. Adding the reranker makes the output more compact globally. We observe that when rewriting longer text, the abstractor would have many facts to choose from ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> sentence 2) and this is where the reranker helps avoid redundancy across sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We Here we describe the convolutional sentence representation used in Sec. 2.1.1. We use the temporal convolutional model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim (2014)</ref> to compute the representation of every individual sentence in the document. First, the words are converted to the distributed vector representation by a learned word embedding matrix W emb . The sequence of the word vectors from each sentence is then fed through 1-D single-layer convolution filters with various window sizes <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5)</ref> to capture the temporal dependencies of nearby words and then followed by relu non-linear activation and max-over-time pooling. The convolutional representation r j for the jth sentence is then obtained by concatenating the outputs from the activations of all filter window sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Abstractor</head><p>In this section we discuss the architecture choices for our abstractor network in Sec. 2.2. At a highlevel, it is a sequence-to-sequence model with attention and copy mechanism (but no coverage). Note that the abstractor network is a separate neural network from the extractor agent without any form of parameter sharing.</p><p>Sequence-Attention-Sequence Model We use a standard encoder-aligner-decoder model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luong et al., 2015)</ref> with the bilinear multiplicative attention function <ref type="bibr">(Luong et al., 2015)</ref>, f att (h i , z j ) = h i W attn z j , for the context vector e j . We share the source and target embedding matrix W emb as well as output projection matrix as in Inan et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Press and Wolf (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Paulus et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Copy Mechanism</head><p>We add the copying mechanism as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al.

A copy probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p copy = σ(v ẑẑ j + v s z j + v w w j + b)</formula><p>is calculated by learnable parameters v's and b, and then is used to further compute a weighted sum of the probability of source vocabulary and the predefined vocabulary. At test time, an OOV prediction is replaced by the document word with the highest attention score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Actor-Critic Policy Gradient</head><p>Here we discuss the details of the actor-critic policy gradient training. Given the MDP formulation described in Sec. 3.2 , the return (total discounted future reward) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">R t = Ns t=1 γ t r(t + 1)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>for each recurrent step t. To learn a optimal policy π * that maximize the state-value function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">V π * (c) = E π * [R t |c t = c]</formula><p>we will make use of the action-value function</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Q π θ (c, j) = E π θ [R t |c t = c, j t = j]</formula><p>We then take the policy gradient theorem and then substitute the action-value function with the Monte-Carlo sample:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">∇ θ J(θ) = E π θ [∇ θ logπ θ (c, j)Q π θ (c, j)] (10) = 1 N s Ns t=1 ∇ θ logπ θ (c t , j t )R t<label>(11)</label></formula><p>which runs a single episode and gets the return (estimate of action-value function) by sampling from the policy π θ , where N s is the total number of sentences the agent extracts. This gradient update is also known as the REINFORCE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Williams, 1992)</ref>. The vanilla REINFORCE algorithm is known for high variance. To mitigate this problem we add a critic network with trainable parameters θ c having the same structure as the pointer-network's decoder (described in Sec. 2.1.2) but change the final output layer to regress the state-value function V π θa,ω (c). The predicted value b θc,ω (c) is called the baseline and is subtracted from the actionvalue function to estimate the advantage</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A π θ (c, j) = Q π θa,ω (c, j) − b θc,ω (c)</formula><p>where θ = {θ a , θ c , ω} denotes the set of all trainable parameters. The new policy gradient for our extractor can be estimated by substituting the action-value function in Eqn. 10 by the advantage and then use Monte-Carlo samples (use R t to esti- </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">∇ θa,ω J(θ a , ω) ≈ 1 N s Ns t=1 [∇ θa,ω logπ θ (c, j)A π θ (c, j)]<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Here we also show an interesting finding of the effect adding the EOE action. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, we can see that the average reward is low in the beginning but quickly goes up after the agent picks up the EOE action. The low beginning reward is because the agent does not choose the EOE action hence keep getting zero rewards when extracting extra sentences, which lowers the average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 Sentence Selection Baseline ff-ext</head><p>In this subsection, we describe the detailed network structure of the feed-forward extractor baseline (ff-ext). Following the hierarchical sentence representation described in Sec. 2.1.1, if we add another assumption that there exists a sequence j i1 , j i2 , . . . , j iNs where j i1 &lt; j i2 &lt; · · · &lt; j iNs such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">[d i1 , d i2 , · · · , d iN d ] = x i and [g(d j i1 ), g(d j i2 ), · · · , g(d j iNs )] = y i<label>(13)</label></formula><p>i.e., the extracted document are summarized in the order as is, we could apply the following feedforward structure for sentence selection. We first learn a document representation bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">x = tanh(W d 1 N d N d j=1 h j + b d )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where N d , N s each denotes the number of sentences in the document x and the summary y respectively. And then we compute the extraction probability:</p><p>for each sentence in the document. Assuming we have the groundtruth extraction labels j 1 , . . . , j Ns , the above formulation treats sentence selection as a sequence of binary classification problems, where W s and bs are trainable parameters. We can therefore train the sentence selection network endto-end by cross-entropy loss, where W s and bs are trainable parameters. At test time, the feed-forward extractor chooses the top-k sentences and then concatenates them as the original order in the document. Note that we still refer to this network as feed-forward extractor (ff-ext) to distinguish from the pointer network extractor (rnn-ext) though it contains recurrent structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1 Dataset Details</head><p>We use the CNN/Daily Mail dataset first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hermann et al. (2015)</ref> for reading comprehension task. This dataset has been modified for summarization by <ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref>. This dataset differs from previous Gigaword dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rush et al., 2015)</ref> in the length of the text: both documents and summaries for CNN/Daily Mail is much longer. The standard split of the dataset contains 287,227 documents for training, 13,368 documents for validation, and 11,490 for testing. Note that the original release of this dataset by Hermann et al. <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref> is an anonymized version, where the named entities are anonymized and treated as a single word in the evaluation n-gram matching. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> proposed to use the non-anonymized, original-text version of the dataset. For a fair comparison to prior works, we show results on both versions of the dataset. The experiment runs training and evaluation for each version separately (but we transfer the same tuned hyperparameters from original to anonymized version).</p><p>The DUC-2002 dataset contains 567 documentsummary pairs for single-document summarization. Due to its small size, we utilize it in a test-only setup: we directly use the CNN/Daily Mail (original text) trained model to summarize the DUC documents for testing generalization/transfer our models. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> on DUC is obtained by running their publicly available pretrained model. We evaluate the results using the official ROUGE F1 script.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Hyperparameter Details</head><p>All hyper-parameters are tuned on the validation set of the original text version of CNN/DM. We use mini-batches of 32 samples for all the training. Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is used with learning rate 0.001 for ML and 0.0001 for RL training (other hyper-parameters at their default). We apply gradient clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) using 2-norm of 2.0. We do not use any regularization technique except early-stopping. We also found that halving the learning rate whenever validation loss stops decreasing speeds up convergence. For RL training, we use γ = 0.95 for the discount factor in Eqn. 9. We first train the abstractor and extractors separately until convergence with maximum-likelihood objectives, then apply RL training on the trained sub-modules. For all LSTM-RNNs we use 256 hidden units. We use single layer LSTM-RNN with 256 hidden units for all models. The initial states of RNN are learned for our extractor agent. For the abstractor network, we learn a linear mapping to transform the encoder final states to the decoder initial states. We also train a word2vec <ref type="bibr">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> of 128 dimension on the same corpus to initialize the embedding matrix for all maximum-likelihood trained models and the embedding matrix is updated during training. We set a vocabulary size of 30000 most common words in the training set. For saving the memory space in training, we truncate the input article sentences to a maximum length of 100 tokens and summary sentences to 30 tokens (note that this is counted at the sentence-level for our abstractor training). We use all possible sentence pairs within every summary without limit. At test time, the length of input is not limited and the generation limit remains 30 maximum tokens for the abstractor. For all non-RL models, the number of sentences to extract is tuned on the validation set. For the reranking (see Sec. 3.3), we set N = 2 (bi-gram) and k = 5 (beam size). <ref type="bibr">22</ref> The diversity ratio of the diverse beam-search  is set to 1.0.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(2018) use RL for ranking sentences in pure extraction-based summarization and Ç elikyilmaz et al.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">We are releasing our code, best pretrained models, as well as output summaries, to promote future research: https://github.com/ChenRocks/fast_abs_rl</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Note that we force-zero the extraction prob. of already extracted sentences so as to prevent the model from using repeating document sentences and suffering from redundancy. This is non-differentiable and hence only done in RL training.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">We use the terminology of copy mechanism (originally named pointer-generator) in order to avoid confusion with the pointer network.4 Nallapati et al. (2017)  selected sentences greedily to maximize the global summary-level ROUGE, whereas we match exactly 1 document sentence for each GT summary sentence based on the individual sentence-level score.Abstractor Training: For the abstractor training, we create training pairs by taking each summary sentence and pairing it with its extracted document sentence (based on Eqn. 6). The network is trained as an usual sequence-to-sequence model to minimize the cross-entropy loss L(θ abs ) = − 1 M M m=1 logP θ abs (w m |w 1:m−1 ) of the decoder language model at each generation step, where θ abs is the set of trainable parameters of the abstractor and w m the m th generated word.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">important information been generated); while ROUGE-L is used as intermediate rewards since it is known for better measurement of language fluency within a local sentence.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">The ff-ext model outperforms rnn-ext possibly because it does not predict sentence ordering; thus is easier to optimize and the n-gram based metrics do not consider sentence ordering. Also note that in our MDP formulation, we cannot apply RL on ff-ext due to its historyless nature. Even if applied naively, there is no mean for the feed-forward model to learn the EOE described in Sec. 3.2.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="14">We do not list the scores of their pure RL model because they discussed its bad readability.15  We selected human annotators that were located in the US, had an approval rate greater than 95%, and had at least 10,000 approved HITs on record.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">P (d j = 1|h j ,x) = σ(W c h j + h j W sx + b)21  We found that updating with mini-batch of episodes and standardizing Rt over all time steps and all episodes within the batch helps converging.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="22">Due to the fact that the size of the reranking list is exponential to the number of sentences of the generated summary n, we pruned the beam so as to allow completion (of dev-set summarization) in a reasonable amount of time, as following: for n ≤ 5 , we use our standard beam size of k = 5, but for larger n values, we use gradually-reduced k values: (6, 4), (7 − 8, 3), (9+, 2) for (n, k).B.3 Training SpeedIt took a total of 19.71 hours 23 to train our model. On the other hand,<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> reported more than 78 hours of training. The training speed gain is mainly from the shortened input/target pairs of our abstractor model. Since our encoder-decoderaligner structure operates on sentence pair, it trains much faster the the document-summary pair used in the pointer-generator model<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(See et al., 2017)</ref>. We also report here the speed of training our abstractor as time per training update. 24 Our abstractor only requires 0.54 seconds per updates while<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> needs 3.42. For all our speed experiments we use K40 GPUs (similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref>. The reduced sequence length gives us an advantage of 6x. Also, the model proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">See et al. (2017)</ref> needs careful scheduling of the sentence lengths.C Generation SamplesPlease seeFig. 4andFig. 5for the output examples (see the discussion of this example in Sec. 7.2). 23 4.15 hours for the abstractor, 15.56 hours for the RL training. Extractor ML training can be run at the same time with abstractor training and is approximately 1.5 hours.24  We use their publicly available code and run training (without coverage mechanism) on our machine for a fair comparison. The number of vocabulary, embedding dimension, RNN hidden units are also set to the same as our model. We set their maximum encoder and decoder steps to 400 and 100 respectively, as reported in their paper.</note>
