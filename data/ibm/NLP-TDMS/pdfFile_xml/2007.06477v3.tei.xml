<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Attempts to render deep learning models interpretable, data-efficient, and robust have seen some success through hybridisation with rule-based systems, for example, in Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs). These neuro-symbolic models can induce interpretable rules and learn representations from data via back-propagation, while providing logical explanations for their predictions. However, they are restricted by their computational complexity, as they need to consider all possible proof paths for explaining a goal, thus rendering them unfit for large-scale applications. We present Conditional Theorem Provers (CTPs), an extension to NTPs that learns an optimal rule selection strategy via gradient-based optimisation. We show that CTPs are scalable and yield stateof-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which tests systematic generalisation of neural models by learning to reason over smaller graphs and evaluating on larger ones. Finally, CTPs show better link prediction results on standard benchmarks in comparison with other neural-symbolic models, while being explainable. All source code and datasets are available online. 1</p></div>

Interestingly, they found that performance degrades monotonically for every model in their pool as they increase the complexity of the relational graph, highlighting the challenge of systematic generalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lake &amp; Baroni, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sodhani et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning A promising direction for overcoming these issues consists in combining neural models and symbolic reasoning given their complementary strengths and weaknesses (d'Avila <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Garcez et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> arXiv:2007.06477v3 [cs.AI] 24 Aug 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Evans &amp; Grefenstette, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Garnelo &amp; Shanahan, 2019)</ref>. We focus on NTPs , a family of neuro-symbolic reasoning models: NTPs are continuous relaxations of the backward-chaining reasoning algorithm that replace discrete symbols with their continuous embedding representations.</p><p>NTPs have interesting properties: they can jointly learn representations and interpretable rules from data via backpropagation, and can potentially combine such rules in ways that may have not been observed during training. However, a major limitation in NTPs is that, during training, they need to consider all rules for explaining a given goal or sub-goal. This quickly renders them ineffective in settings requiring a large number of rules or reasoning steps.</p><p>Conditional Theorem Provers For addressing limitations of NTPs, we propose CTPs, an extension that is able to learn an adaptive strategy for selecting subsets of rules to consider at each step of the reasoning process. This is achieved by a select module that, given a goal, produce the rules needed for proving it. Predicates and constants in the produced rules lie in a continuous embedding space. Hence, the select module is end-to-end differentiable, and can be trained jointly with the other modules via gradient-based optimisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">End-to-End Differentiable Proving</head><p>NTPs ) are a continuous relaxation of the backward chaining algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Russell &amp; Norvig, 2010)</ref>: this algorithm works backward from the goal, chaining through rules to find known facts supporting the proof.</p><p>Given a query (or goal) G, backward chaining first attempts to unify it with the facts available in a given Knowledge Base (KB). If no matching fact is available, it considers all rules H :-B, where H denotes the head (or consequence) and B the body (or premise), and H can be unified with the query G resulting in a substitution for the variables contained in H. Then, the backward chaining algorithm applies the substitution to the body B, and recursively attempts to prove the atoms contained therein.</p><p>Backward chaining can be seen as a type of and/or search: or because the goal can be proven by any rule in the KB, and and because all the conjuncts in the premise of a rule must be proven.</p><p>Example 2.1 (Backward Chaining). Consider a KB composed by the facts p(RICK, BETH) and p(BETH, MORTY), and by the rule g(X, Y) :p(X, Z), p(Z, Y), where p and g denote the relationships parent and grandparent, respectively. The goal G = g(RICK, MORTY) can be proven by unifying G with the head of the rule g(X, Y), with the substitution {X/RICK, Y/MORTY}, and then by re-cursively proving the subgoals p(RICK, Z), p(Z, MORTY), which hold true for the substitution {Z/BETH}.</p><p>NTPs make this reasoning process more flexible and endto-end differentiable by replacing the comparison between symbols with a soft matching of their respective trainable dense vector representations. NTPs recursively build a neural network enumerating all possible proof paths for proving a query given KB, and aggregate all proof scores via max pooling. They do so by relying on three modules: a unification module, which compares sub-symbolic representations of logic atoms, and mutually recursive or and and modules, which jointly enumerate all possible proof paths, before the final aggregation selects the highest scoring one. The whole process is outlined in Algorithm 1.   propose replacing comparisons between symbols with a differentiable similarity measure K : R k × R k → [0, 1], such as a Gaussian kernel, between their embeddings. Their model enumerates all possible proofs for a goal G, and generates a proof score for each of them, given by the minimum of all embedding similarities. For instance, if G = grandPa(RICK, MORTY) = [grandPa, RICK, MORTY], one candidate proof consists in using the facts F = p(RICK, BETH) and F = p(BETH, MORTY) and the rule g(X, Y) :p(X, Z), p(Z, Y) from the KB, yielding the score K(θ grandPa , θ g ). It is important to mention that NTPs allow unifying symbols like grandPa and g (which, in this case, share the same semantics), even though they are lexically different. The score for G is given by the maximum of all proof scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conditional Proving Strategies</head><p>The NTPs proposed by  use a fixed set of rules, either specified by the user or learned from data via provided rule templates. In this model, given a goal, there is no hard decision mechanism for deciding which rules can be used for reformulating a given goal into subgoals: all rules in the KB need to be considered when proving each goal. For this reason, NTPs were shown not to scale to large datasets .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differentiable Goal Reformulation</head><p>In order to explicitly learn which rule to consider at each step, we propose the following solution. Rather than relying on a fixed, potentially very large set of rules, we propose to dynamically generate a minimal set of rules via a neural network architecture conditioned on the goal to prove.</p><p>Example 3.1 (Conditional Theorem Proving). Assume that Algorithm 1 Overview of the neural backward chaining algorithm proposed by  -intuitively, it recursively proves each goal with all rules in the KB (OR module) and, for each rule, it proves its premise (AND module), up to d recursion steps. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(S ψ , S ρ )) 2: S ψ = S ψ i T i with T i =      {H i /G i } if H i ∈ V {G i /H i } if G i ∈ V, H i ∈ V ∅ otherwise 3: S ρ = min {S ρ } Hi,Gi ∈V {K(θ Hi , θ Gi )} 4: return (S ψ , S ρ )</formula><p>Algorithm 2 In Conditional Theorem Provers, the set of rules is conditioned on the goal G. yield S the goal to prove is G = g(RICK, MORTY), we want the model to be able to only consider the best rules for proving G, such as g(X, Y) :p(X, Z), p(Z, Y), rather than all rules in the KB. Remember that, in NTPs, relations and constants in the KB are represented by their embedding vectors, and the aforementioned rule selection can be implemented via a mapping from θ g: to [θ p: , θ p: ].</p><p>Consider the or module in Algorithm 1. Selecting which rule to use during the proving process for a given goal G can be implemented by rewriting the or module as in Algorithm 2, where the set of clauses is produced by a module that, given the goal, generates a set of rules for proving G.</p><p>The core difference between NTPs and CTPs is that, when proving a goal G, rather than iterating through a possibly very large set of clauses in the KB K (see Line 2 in the or module definition in Algorithm 1), the conditional or module in Algorithm 2 only iterates through a small set of generated clauses, whose generation is conditioned on G (see Line 2 in Algorithm 2). Given a goal G, the select module with parameters θ in Algorithm 2 produces a set of clauses, each specifying which sub-goals to prove in order to produce a proof for G.</p><p>Note that the select module can be implemented by an end-to-end differentiable parametrised function f (·) that, given a goal G, produces a finite sequence of corresponding subgoals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">select θ (G) : A → [A :-A * ] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where V is a set of variables, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A R k × (R k ∪ V) × (R k ∪ V)</formula><p>denotes the embedding representation of a goal, such as g(RICK, MORTY).</p><p>For instance, the select module in Eq. 1 can be implemented by a neural network that, given a goal such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">G = [θ g: , θ RICK: , θ MORTY: ], generates H :-B with H = [θ g: , X, Y] and B = [[θ p: , X, Z], [θ p: , Z, Y]], correspond- ing to the symbolic rule g(X, Y) :-p(X, Z), p(Z, Y).</formula><p>If the positions of the variables in the rule are fixed, the whole module is end-to-end differentiable with respect to its parameters θ.</p><p>Neural Goal Reformulation Here, we define select as a linear function of the goal predicate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">select θ (G) [F H (G) :-F B1 (G), F B2 (G)] ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the head and body of the resulting rule are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F H (G) = [f H (θ G1 ), X, Y], F B1 (G) = [f B1 (θ G1 ), X, Z], and F B2 (G) = [f B2 (θ G1 ), Z, Y]. Every f i : R k → R k is a differentiable function, such as the linear projection f i (x) = W i x + b, with W i ∈ R k×k and b ∈ R k .</formula><p>Thus, instead of iterating through a possibly very large set of rules in the KB K, we can generate a significantly smaller set of rules, whose generation is conditioned on the goal G and can be trained end-to-end on downstream reasoning tasks.</p><p>Attentive Goal Reformulation We can incorporate a useful prior in the select module architecture-namely that predicate symbols in the rule already exist in the KB, among the available relations R. A method for incorporating this prior consists in using the given goal G for generating a distribution over the set of relations R:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f i (x) = α E R α = softmax (W i x) ∈ ∆ |R|−1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where E R ∈ R |R|×k denotes the predicate embedding matrix, W i ∈ R k×|R| , and α is an attention distribution α ∈ ∆ |R|−1 over the predicates in R, where ∆ n denotes  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Example of a train and test instance in CLUTRR -the training instance (upper left) is composed by a graph with three edges, while the test instance is composed by ten edges; the task consists in identifying the relationships between the green nodes.</p><p>the standard n-simplex. 2 This is especially helpful if the embedding size is larger than the number of relationships, i.e. k |R|.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory-Based Goal Reformulation</head><p>A problem with using black-box neural networks for reformulating goals into sub-goals is that it can be difficult to inspect the rules by analysing the model parameters, as in . For this reason, we propose an alternative goal reformulation module, where rules are stored in a differentiable memory.</p><p>More precisely, n rules are stored as memory matrices [M 1 , . . . , M m ], where each M i ∈ R n×k denotes the kdimensional embeddings of the i-th predicates in the n rules. Then, the goal G is used to compute an attention distribution over rules α ∈ ∆ n−1 , where each α i denotes the attention weight on the i-th rule. The attention distribution can be formalised as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f i (x) = α M i α = softmax (Wx) ∈ ∆ n−1 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where each f i : R k → R k is a differentiable function that, given the goal, produces an attention distribution α ∈ ∆ n−1 over the rules and for indexing a memory M i , analogous to a key-value memory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Miller et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

Given a set of family relations, encoded as a graph with a variable number of nodes and edges, the goal is to infer the relationship between two family members, whose relationship is not explicitly mentioned. To solve this task, a learning agent should be able to induce the logical rules governing the kinship relationships, such as the parent of a parent is a grandparent, and use these rules to infer the relationship between a given pair of entities.</p><p>CLUTRR allows testing a learning agent's ability for systematic generalisation, by testing on graphs containing combinations of logical rules that were not seen during training. Each edge in the graph is labelled with one out of nine family relation type from R = { child, grand, in-law, inv-child, inv-grand, inv-in-law, inv-un, sibling, un }, and the task consists in inferring the relationship between two of the nodes in the graph. During training, a model is trained to infer such relationship by traversing a limited number of edges (such as two, three, and four edges), and during evaluation the model has to traverse up to ten edges. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows an example of a training instance and a test instance in CLUTRR: the training instances consists in a graph modelling a set of family relations of only three edges, while the test instance is composed by a graph with ten edges.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Results</head><p>CLUTRR We evaluated three CTP variants and all considered baselines on two datasets published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sinha et al.

Results for CLUTRR G (k = 2, 3) are summarised in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, while results for CLUTRR G (k = 2, 3, 4) are summarised in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, we observe that, after training on graphs with two and three edges, baseline models tend to be able to generalise correctly to slightly longer stories (such as graphs with four and five edges), but that predictive accuracy quickly decreases with increasing graph sizes and this phenomenon happens when tuning hyper-parameters either on graphs with three edges or on graph with nine edges.</p><p>In our experiments, LSTMs had a strikingly different be-haviour in comparison with other baselines: for graphs with nine edges, the accuracy decrease caused by using the LSTMs baseline is only significant with p ≤ 10 −2 (for all other baselines this change is significant with p ≤ 10 −4 ), with a drop in significance for smaller graphs.</p><p>The phenomenon that LSTMs yield surprisingly accurate results on the CLUTRR dataset can be seen across every experiment in our empirical evaluation, while other recurrent models such as RNNs and GRUs do not show this.</p><p>Model Analysis A great feature of CTPs is that we can analyse the goal reformulation process to understand the reasoning process underlying a given prediction, and extract explainable rules. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, we show a sample of the rules and common-sense reasoning patterns learned by CTPs on the CLUTRR dataset.</p><p>We can see that, for example, CTPs successfully identify that e.g. the child of a child is a grandchild, the child of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Comparison of CTPs, with GNTPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Minervini et al., 2020)</ref>, NeuralLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref> and MINERVA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Das et al., 2018)</ref> (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Minervini et al.

For all models, the embedding size for entities and relations was set to 50.</p><p>Figure 5 demonstrates how the training accuracy of such models evolves during training. We can see that, while the three CTP variants get to a nearly-perfect training set accuracy in less than 300 iterations, GNTPs is unable to match this result, even after careful hyperparameter tuning. A possible explanation is that, in order to scale to large rule sets, GNTPs only considers the top-k rules, based on the similarity between the goal and the head of the rules. This is equivalent to a hard attention mask, which is known to be problematic to train via gradient-based optimisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Luong et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Link Prediction</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we show link prediction results in comparison with three other neuro-symbolic reasoning methods, namely GNTPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Minervini et al., 2020)</ref>, NeuralLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref> and MINERVA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Das et al., 2018)</ref>. GNTPs are an extension of NTPs where rules are heuristically selected by search for the rules where the head predicate is closest to the sub-goal predicate in embedding space.</p><p>Our experiments show that CTPs produce significantly more accurate or very competitive link prediction results, while controlling the complexity of the reasoning process via the goal-conditioned rule selection. For instance, in the Nations dataset, only two rules were generated by CTPs for each goal, while in  NTPs were required to iterate over sixty rules.</p><p>Furthermore, in this case, CTPs were able to produce explanations for each of their predictions. For instance, in the Nations dataset, CTPs successfully extracted logical patterns such as commonbloc1(X, Y) :relngo(Y, X), timesincewar(X, Y) :independence(X, Y), unweightedunvote(X, Y) :relngo(X, Y), and ngo(X, Y) :independence(Y, X).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We introduced CTPs, an extension to NTPs for learning the optimal rule selection strategy via gradient-based optimisation. For each sub-goal, a select module produces a smaller set of rules, which is then used during the proving mechanism. Furthermore, we proposed three variants of the rule selection mechanism, where the sub-goal reformulations are obtained by linear projections of the sub-goal predicate, attention distributions over predicate embeddings, and a key-value memory lookup over a set of rules.</p><p>We showed that CTPs are scalable and yield state-of-the-art results on the CLUTRR dataset, which explicitly tests the systematic generalisation of neural models, in comparison with a wide set of neural baselines. Finally, we demonstrated that CTPs yield competitive results in standard link prediction benchmark in comparison with other neuro-symbolic approaches.</p><p>Future Work An open problem is how CTPs can be able to process CLUTRR instances where family relationships are not directly provided as a labelled graph, but rather as free-form text. A possible solution, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Minervini et al. (2020)</ref>, consists in having an end-to-end differentiable encoder for producing the fact embeddings conditioned on the text, and we are currently analysing several options in this space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Hyperparameter Selection</head><p>For model selection in baseline models, we generated a CLUTRR-like dataset using the code published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sinha et al. (2019)</ref> composed by a training set of graphs with {2, 3} edges, and two test sets, one with graphs with three edges, and another with graphs with nine edges. We then selected two sets of hyperparameters for each of the baselines: one that maximises the validation accuracy on graphs with three edges, and another that maximises the test accuracy on graphs with nine edges. For each of the baselines, we considered a wide range of hyperparameters: the dimensionalities of node and edge embeddings were varied in {10, 50, 100, 200, 500}, the number of attention heads in attention-based architectures in {1, 2, . . . , 10}, the number of filters in convolutional architectures in {1, 2, . . . , 10}, and the number of hidden units in recurrent architectures in {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}.</p><p>To assess the statistical significance of our results, we ran each of the experiments 10 times, each time with a different seed, and compared the resulting accuracy values using an unequal variances t-test, or Welch's t-test. This is motivated by the observation that accuracy values to be Gaussiandistributed, as they approach a normal distribution for large numbers of re-runs, due to the Central Limit Theorem.</p></div>
