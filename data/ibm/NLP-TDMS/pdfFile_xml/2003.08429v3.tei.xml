<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Existing methods for instance segmentation in videos typically involve multi-stage pipelines that follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm and model a video clip as a sequence of images. Multiple networks are used to detect objects in individual frames, and then associate these detections over time. Hence, these methods are often non-end-toend trainable and highly tailored to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose a different approach that is well-suited to a variety of tasks involving instance segmentation in videos. In particular, we model a video clip as a single 3D spatio-temporal volume, and propose a novel approach that segments and tracks instances across space and time in a single stage. Our problem formulation is centered around the idea of spatio-temporal embeddings which are trained to cluster pixels belonging to a specific object instance over an entire video clip. To this end, we introduce (i) novel mixing functions that enhance the feature representation of spatio-temporal embeddings, and (ii) a single-stage, proposal-free network that can reason about temporal context. Our network is trained end-to-end to learn spatio-temporal embeddings as well as parameters required to cluster these embeddings, thus simplifying inference. Our method achieves stateof-the-art results across multiple datasets and tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/sabarim/STEm-Seg.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of segmenting and tracking multiple objects in videos is becoming increasingly popular due to a surge in development of autonomous vehicles and robots that are able to perceive and accurately track surrounding objects. These advances are driven by the recent emergence of new datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref> containing videos with dense, per-pixel annotations of object instances. The underlying task tackled in these datasets can be summarized as follows: given an input video containing multiple objects, each pixel has to be uniquely assigned to a specific object instance or to the background. State-of-the-art methods tackling these tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref> usually operate in a top-down fashion and follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm which is wellestablished in multi-object tracking (MOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. Such methods usually employ multiple networks to detect objects in individual images <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, associate them over consecutive frames, and resolve occlusions using learned appearance models. Though these approaches yield high-quality results, they involve multiple networks, are computationally demanding, and not end-to-end trainable.</p><p>Inspired by the Perceptual Grouping Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, we learn to segment object instances in videos in a bottom-up fashion by leveraging spatio-temporal embeddings. To this end, we propose an efficient, single-stage network that operates directly on a 3D spatio-temporal volume. We train the embeddings in a categoryagnostic setting, such that pixels belonging to the same object instance across the spatio-temporal volume are mapped to a single cluster in the embedding space. This way, we can infer object instances by simply assigning pixels to their respective clusters. Our method outperforms proposal-based methods for tasks involving pixel-precise tracking such as Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, and Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p><p>To summarize, our contributions are the following: (i) We propose a unified approach for tasks involving instance segmentation in videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>. Our method performs consistently well under highly varied settings (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) such as automotive driving scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, semantically diverse YouTube videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> and scenarios where object classes are not pre-defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. (ii) We propose using spatio-temporal embeddings for the aforementioned set of tasks. To this end, we propose a set of mixing functions (Sec. 3.2) that improve performance by modifying the feature representation of these embeddings. Our method enables a simple inference procedure based on clustering within a 3D spatio-temporal volume, thus alleviating the need for external components for temporal association. (iii) We propose a single-stage network architecture which is able to effectively incorporate temporal context and learn the spatio-temporal embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Image-level Instance Segmentation: Several existing methods for imagelevel instance segmentation, which is closely related to our task, operate in a top-down fashion by using a Region Proposal Network to generate object proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, which are then classified and segmented <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Other methods operate in a bottom-up fashion by grouping pixels belonging to the same object instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Novotny et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> introduce an embedding mixing function to overcome appearance ambiguity, and predict a displacement field from the instance-specific center, which is similar to Hough voting based methods for object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. Recent methods for 3D object detection and instance segmentation also follow this trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106]</ref>. Neven et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> by training a network to predict object centers and clustering bandwidths, thus alleviating the need for density-based clustering algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. This serves as a basis for our work. However, in contrast to our approach, the aforementioned methods are only suitable for image-level segmentation.</p><p>Video Segmentation: Temporally consistent object segmentation in videos can benefit several other tasks such as action/activity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, video object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and object discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>. Several bottomup methods segment moving regions by grouping based on optical flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref> or point trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>. By contrast, our method segments and tracks both moving and static objects. Other methods obtain video object proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> based on cues such as actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> or image-level objects of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. Feature representations are then learned for these proposals in order to perform classification. Instead, we propose a single-stage approach that localizes objects with pixel-level precision.</p><p>Pixel-precise Tracking of Multiple Objects: Multi object tracking (MOT) has its roots in robotic perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>. Although some works extend MOT with pixel-precise masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>, a much larger set of works can be found in the domain of Video Object Segmentation (VOS), which encompasses multiple tasks related to pixel-precise tracking. In the semi-supervised variant of VOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the ground-truth masks of the objects which are meant to be tracked are given for the first frame. State-of-the-art approaches to this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105]</ref> usually involve online fine-tuning on the first frame masks and/or follow the object proposal generation and mask propagation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105]</ref>. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> tackle this problem by learning embeddings from the first-frame masks, and then associating pixels in the remaining frames.</p><p>More relevant to our work is the task of unsupervised VOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. Here, no ground truth information is provided at test-time, and the goal is to segment and track all dominant "foreground" objects in the video clip. Current stateof-the-art methods for this task are either proposal-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107]</ref> or focus on foreground-background segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> propose an approach that groups pixel embeddings based on objectness and optical flow cues. In contrast to ours, this method processes each frame separately, employs K-means clustering for object localization, and cannot separate different object instances. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> employ an attentive graph neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and use differentiable message passing to propagate information across time; we compare our results to theirs in Sec. 4.5.</p><p>Recently, the task of Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> were introduced. Voigtlaender et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> extended the KITTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and MOTChallenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref> datasets with pixelprecise annotations, and proposed a baseline method that adapts Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to associate object proposals across time. Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> use a mask network to filter foreground embeddings and perform mean-shift clustering to generate object masks, which are then associated over time using a distance threshold unlike our single-stage end-to-end method.</p><p>The YouTube-VIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> contains a large number of YouTube videos with per-pixel annotations for a variety of object classes. Compared to MOTS, these videos contain fewer instances, but are significantly more diverse. In addition to adapting several existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref> for this task, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> also proposed their own method (MaskTrack-RCNN) which extends Mask R-CNN with additional cues for data association. Methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> also rely on object proposals and/or heuristic post-processing to associate objects over time, unlike our end-to-end bottom-up approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our Method</head><p>We tackle the task of instance segmentation in videos by modeling the video clip as a 3D spatio-temporal volume and using a network to learn an embedding for each pixel in that volume. This network is trained to push pixels belonging to different object instances towards different, non-overlapping clusters in the embedding space. This differs from most existing approaches, which first generate object detections per-frame, and then associate them over time. The following sections explain our problem formulation, the network architecture and loss functions employed, and the inference process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Formulation</head><p>As input, we assume a video clip with T frames of resolution H × W . Let us denote the set of RGB pixels in this clip with X ∈ R N ×3 where N = T × H × W . Assuming there are K object instances in this clip (K is unknown), our aim is to produce a segmentation that assigns each pixel in the clip to either the background, or to exactly one of these K instances. We design a network that predicts video instance tubes by clustering pixels simultaneously across space and time based on a learned embedding function. Instead of learning just the embedding function and then using standard density-based clustering algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> to obtain instance tubes, we take inspiration from Neven et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and design a network which estimates the cluster centers as well as their corresponding variances, thus enabling efficient inference. Formally, our network can be viewed as a function that maps the set of pixels X to three outputs; (1) E ∈ R N ×E : an E-dimensional embedding for each pixel, (2) V ∈ R N ×E + : a positive variance for each pixel and each embedding dimension, and (3) H ∈ [0, 1] N : an object instance center heat-map.</p><p>Instance representation: The network is trained such that the embeddings belonging to the j th instance in the video clip are modeled by a multivariate Gaussian distribution N (µ j , Σ j ). Assuming that this instance comprises the set of pixel coordinates C j with cardinality N j , we denote the embeddings and variances output by the network at these coordinates using</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E j ⊂ E, E j ∈ R Nj ×E and V j ⊂ V, V j ∈ R Nj ×E +</formula><p>, respectively. During training, C j (i.e., the ground truth mask tube for instance j) is known. Using it, the mean µ j and covariance Σ j of the distribution are computed by averaging over the per-pixel outputs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µ j = 1 N j e ∈ Ej e ∈ R E , Σ j = 1 N j diag   v ∈ Vj v   ∈ R E×E .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This single distribution models all embeddings belonging to instance j across the entire clip (not individually for each frame). We can now use the distribution N (µ j , Σ j ) to compute the probability p ij of any embedding e i ∈ E, anywhere in the input clip, of belonging to instance j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p ij = 1 (2π) E 2 |Σ j | 1 2 exp − 1 2 (e i − µ j ) T Σ −1 j (e i − µ j ) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Using Eq. 2 to compute p ij , ∀ i ∈ {1, .. , N }, we can obtain the set of pixels C j comprising the predicted mask tube for instance j by thresholding the probabilities at 0.5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C j = { (x i , y i , t i ) | i ∈ {1, .. , N }, p ij &gt; 0.5 } .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Training: This way, the training objective can be formulated as one of learning the optimal parameters µ opt j and Σ opt j which maximize the intersection-overunion (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth mask tubes in the clip:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">µ opt j , Σ opt j = argmax µj ,Σ j C j ∩ C j C j ∪ C j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>that is, all pixels in the ground truth mask tube C j should have probability larger than 0.5, and vice versa. A classification loss such as cross-entropy could be used to optimize the pixel probabilities. However, we employ the Lovàsz hinge loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref> (details in supplementary material), which is a differentiable, convex surrogate of the Jaccard index that directly optimizes the IoU. This formulation allows µ j and Σ j to be implicitly learned by the network. Using Eqs. 1-4, we can define and optimize the distribution for every instance (i.e. ∀j ∈ {1, ..., K}). Note that only a single forward pass of the network is required regardless of the number of instances in the clip. This is in contrast to common approaches for Video Object Segmentation, which only process one instance at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>.</p><p>We further remark that ours is a bottom-up approach which detects and tracks objects in a single step, thus mitigating the inherent drawback of top-down approaches that often require different networks/cues for single-image object detection and temporal association. A further advantage of our approach is that it can implicitly resolve occlusions, insofar as they occur within the clip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Embedding Representation</head><p>Under the formulation described in Sec. 3.1, the network can learn arbitrary representations for the embedding dimensions. However, it is also possible to fix the representation by using a mixing function φ : R E → R E that modifies the embeddings E as follows: E ← {φ(e), | e ∈ E }.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, for the task of single-image instance segmentation, 2D embeddings were used (E = 2) in conjunction with a spatial coordinate mixing function φ xy (e i ) = e i + [x i , y i ] 3 . With this setting, the embeddings could be interpreted as offsets to the (x, y) coordinates of their respective locations. The network thus learned to cluster the embeddings belonging to a given object towards some object-specific point on the image. It follows that the predicted variances could be interpreted as the network's estimate of the size of the object along the x and y axes. We postulate that the reason for this formulation yielding good results is that the (x, y) coordinates already serve as a good initial feature for instance separation; the network can then enhance this representation by producing offsets which further improve the clustering behavior. Furthermore, this can be done in an end-to-end trainable fashion which allows the network to adjust the clustering parameters, i.e., the Gaussian distribution parameters, for each instance. In general, it has been shown that imparting spatial coordinate information to CNNs can improve performance for a variety of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>.</p><p>Compared to single-image segmentation, the task of associating pixels across space and time in in videos poses additional challenges, e.g., camera ego-motion, occlusions, appearance/pose changes. To tackle these challenges we propose (and experimentally validate in Sec. 4.3) the following extensions:</p><p>Spatio-temporal coordinating mixing: Since we operate on video clips instead of single images, a logical extension is to use 3D embeddings (E = 3) with a spatio-temporal coordinate mixing function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">φ xyt (e i ) = e i + [x i , y i , t i ].</formula><p>Free dimensions: In addition to the spatial (and temporal) coordinate dimensions, it can be beneficial to include extra dimensions whose representation is left for the network to decide. The motivation here is to improve instance clustering quality by allowing additional degrees of freedom in the embedding space. From here on, we shall refer to these extra embedding dimensions as free dimensions. For example, if E = 4 with 2 spatial coordinate dimensions and 2 free dimensions, the mixing function is denoted as There is, however, a caveat with free dimensions: since the spatial (and temporal) dimensions already achieve reasonable instance separation, the network may converge to a poor local minimum by producing very large variances for the free dimensions instead of learning a discriminative feature representation. Consequently, the free dimensions may end up offering no useful instance separation during inference. We circumvent this problem at the cost of introducing one extra hyper-parameter by setting the variances for the free dimensions to a fixed value v free . We justify our formulation quantitatively using multiple datasets and different variants of the mixing function φ(·) in Sec. 4.3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ xyff (e i ) = e i + [x i , y i , 0, 0].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Inference</head><p>Since the ground truth mask tube is not known during inference, it is not possible to obtain µ j and Σ j using Eq. 1. This is where the instance center heat map H comes into play. For each pixel c i = (x i , y i , t i ), the value H(c i ) ∈ [0, 1] in the heat map at this location gives us the probability of the embedding vector E(c i ) at this location being an instance center. The sequential process of inferring object instances in a video clip is described in the following algorithm:</p><p>1. Identify the coordinates of the most likely instance center c j = argmax i H(c i ). 2. Find the corresponding embedding vector E(c j ) and variances V(c j ). 3. Using µ j ← E(c j ) and Σ j ← diag (V(c j )), generate the 3D mask tube C j for this instance by computing per-pixel probabilities using Eq. 2, and then thresholding them as in Eq. 3. 4. Since the pixels in C j have now been assigned to an instance, the embeddings, variances and heat map probabilities at these pixel locations are masked out and removed from further consideration:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E ← E \ E j , V ← V \ V j , H ← H \ H j .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>5. Repeat steps 1-4 until either E = V = H = ∅, or the next highest probability in the heat map falls below some threshold.</p><p>Even though this final clustering step ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>) depends on the number of instances in a clip, in practice, the application of Eq. 2 and 3 carries little computational overhead and its run-time is negligible compared to a forward pass.</p><p>Video clip stitching: Due to memory constraints, the clip length that can be input to the network is limited. In order to apply our framework to videos of arbitrary length, we split the input video into clips of length T with an overlap of T c frames between consecutive clips. Linear assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> is then used to associate the predicted tracklets in consecutive clips. The cost metric for this assignment is the IoU between tracks in overlapping frames. Our approach is currently near online because, given a new frame, the delay until its output becomes available is at most T − T c − 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Losses</head><p>Our model's loss function is a linear combination of three terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L total = L emb + L smooth + L center (6)</formula><p>Embedding loss L emb : As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, we use the Lovàsz hinge loss to optimize the IoU between the predicted and ground truth masks for a given instance. The embedding loss for the entire input clip is calculated as the mean of the Lovàsz hinge loss for all object instances in that clip.</p><p>Variance smoothness loss L smooth : To ensure that the variance values at every pixel belonging to an object are consistent, we employ a smoothness loss L smooth similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. This regresses the variances V j for instance j to be close to the average value of all the variances for that instance, i.e. Var[V j ].</p><p>Instance center heat map loss L center : For all pixels belonging to instance j, the corresponding outputs in the sigmoid activated heat map H j are trained with an L 2 regression loss to match the output of Eq. 2. The outputs for background pixels are regressed to 0. During inference, this enables us to sample the highest values from the heat map which corresponds to the peak of the learned Gaussian distributions for the object instances in an input volume, as explained in Sec 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Network Architecture</head><p>The network ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3)</ref> consists of an encoder with two decoders. The first decoder outputs the embeddings E and variances V, while the second outputs the instance center heat map H. The encoder comprises a backbone with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) that produces feature maps at 4 different scales for each image in the input clip. The feature maps at each scale are then stacked along the temporal dimension before being input to each of the decoders. Our decoder consists of 3D convolutions and pooling layers which first compress the feature maps along the temporal dimension before gradually expanding them back to the input size. The underlying idea here is to allow the network to learn temporal context in order to enable pixel association across space and  time. To reduce the decoder's memory footprint and run-time, the large sized feature maps undergo a lower degree of temporal pooling (i.e., fewer convolution/normalization/pooling layers). We call our decoder a temporal squeezeexpand decoder (abbreviated as TSE decoder). In Sec. 4.5, we experimentally validate our network's stand-alone ability to learn spatio-temporal context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Category Prediction</head><p>Our task formulation is inherently category-agnostic. However, some datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref> require a category label for each predicted object track. For such cases we add an additional TSE decoder to the network that performs semantic segmentation for all pixels in the input clip, and that is trained using a standard cross-entropy loss. During inference, the logits for all pixels belonging to a given object instance are averaged, and the highest scoring category label is assigned. Note that this is merely a post-processing step; the instance clustering still happens in a category-agnostic manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Evaluation</head><p>To demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generalization capability, we apply it to three different tasks and datasets involving pixel-precise segmentation and tracking of multiple objects in videos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training</head><p>For all experiments, we use a ResNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> backbone initialized with weights from Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> trained for image instance segmentation on COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The temporal squeeze-expand decoders are initialized with random weights. The network is optimized end-to-end using SGD with momentum 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10 −3 which decays exponentially.</p><p>Augmented Images. Since the amount of publicly available video data with dense per-pixel annotations is limited, we utilize image instance segmentation datasets by synthesizing training clips from single images. We apply on-the-fly random affine transformations and motion blur and show that this technique is effective (Sec. 4.3) even though such augmented image sequences have little visual resemblance to video clips.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Benchmarks</head><p>DAVIS Unsupervised: DAVIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is a popular video object segmentation dataset with 90 videos (60 for training and 30 for validation) containing multiple moving objects of diverse categories. Several DAVIS benchmarks have been introduced over the years; we evaluate our method on the 2019 Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) benchmark in which the salient "foreground objects" in each video have to be segmented and tracked. The evaluation measures employed are (i) J -score (the IoU between predicted and ground truth mask tubes), and (ii) F-score (accuracy of predicted mask boundaries against ground truth). The mean of those measures, J &amp;F, serves as the final score.</p><p>YouTube-VIS: The YouTube Video Instance Segmentation (YT-VIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> dataset contains 2,883 high quality YouTube videos with ∼131k object instances spanning 40 known categories. The task requires all objects belonging to the known category set to be segmented, tracked and assigned a category label. The evaluation measures used for this task are an adaptation of the Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) metrics used for image instance segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KITTI-MOTS:</head><p>Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> extends the KITTI multi-object tracking dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> with pixel-precise instance masks. It contains 21 videos (12 for training and 9 for validation) of driving scenes captured from a moving vehicle. The task here is to segment and track all car and pedestrian instances in the videos. The evaluation measures used are an extension of the CLEAR MOT measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to account for pixel-precise tracking (details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>). We report these measures separately for each object class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Studies</head><p>Embedding formulation: We first ablate the impact of using different mixing functions for the embeddings (Sec. 3.2) on the DAVIS'19 val dataset with clip length T = 8, and summarize the results in Tab. 1(a). Compared to the identity function baseline φ identity , imparting a spatial coordinate offset (φ xy ) improves the J &amp;F from 57.3% to 61.6%. Adding another embedding dimension with a temporal coordinate offset, as in φ xyt , yields a further improvement to 62.6%.</p><p>Comparing the mixing function pairs (φ xyf , φ xyt ) where E = 3, and (φ xyff , φ xytf ) where E = 4, we note that having a free dimension is slightly better than having a temporal dimension since there is a difference of 0.2% J &amp;F for both pairs of functions. This is the case for both DAVIS'19 and YT-VIS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> where φ xyff yields the best results. For KITTI-MOTS however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>  free dimensions yield roughly the same performance. Our intuitive explanation is that for DAVIS and YT-VIS, object instances normally persist throughout the video clip. Therefore, in contrast to the spatial coordinates which serve as a useful feature for instance separation, the temporal coordinate provides no useful separation cue, thus rendering the temporal embedding dimension less effective. On the other hand, using a free dimension enables the network to learn a more discriminative feature representation that can better aid in separating instances. By contrast, objects in KITTI-MOTS driving scenes undergo fast motion and often enter/exit the scene midway through a clip. Thus, the temporal dimension becomes useful for instance separation.</p><p>Having additional embedding dimensions is beneficial, but only up to a certain point (i.e., E = 4). Beyond that, test-time performance drops, as can be seen by comparing φ xyff and φ xyfff . We conclude by noting that our proposed formulations for φ(·) improve performance on video-related tasks compared to existing formulations for single-image tasks <ref type="bibr">[59,?]</ref>. For further discussion and results we refer to the supplementary material.</p><p>Temporal Window Size: Next, we investigate the effect of varying the input clip length on DAVIS'19 val (φ xyff is used throughout). As shown in Tab. 1(b), larger temporal length helps the TSE decoder to predict better quality mask tubes. Increasing the input clip length from T = 4 to T = 16 improves the J &amp;F from 62.2% to 64.7%, respectively. Above T = 24, the performance decreases.</p><p>Training Data: For the DAVIS Unsupervised task, we train on image datasets (COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and Pascal VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) in conjunction with video datasets (YT-VIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> and DAVIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). As shown in Tab. 1(c), this combination yields 64.4% J &amp;F compared to 60.7% when using only video datasets, and 57.1% when using only image datasets. This highlights the benefit of using a combination of imageaugmented and video data. For this ablation, T = 8 and φ xyff were used.</p><p>Semantic Head: Since our network does not produce semantic labels for objects, we adapt it to tasks requiring such labels by adding a semantic segmentation decoder as explained in Sec. 3.6. Here, we compare the quality of our semantic output to an oracle by training our network on a custom train-validation   <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> network trained with the same backbone and data as our method (see supplementary for details). Our method (64.7% J &amp;F) outperforms these baselines and the other published methods by a significant margin, even though we use a single, proposal-free network. AGNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, with the second best score of 61.1%, uses object proposals from Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> on the salient regions detected by their network, and associates them over time using optical flow. We also list the top entries of the DAVIS'19 Challenge Workshop in gray. UnOVOST <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> achieves a higher score (67.0%), but (i) uses several networks along with heuristic-based post-processing, (ii) is an order of magnitude slower (1 vs. 7FPS), and (iii) is highly tailored to this benchmark. To validate this, we adapted UnOVOST to KITTI-MOTS by re-training its networks and optimizing the post-processing parameters with grid search (for further details and analysis of this experiment, we refer to the supplementary). As can be seen in Tab. 4, it does not generalize well to the task of Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation.</p><p>Video Instance Segmentation (VIS): This task requires object instances to be segmented, tracked and also assigned a category label. We therefore adapt our network to this setting as explained in Sec. 3.6. We train jointly on YT-VIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> and augmented images from COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (for COCO, we only use the 20 object classes which overlap with the YT-VIS class set). Since this is a new task with few published works, we compare our method to various baselines and adaptions of existing works from <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>    post-processing. Since MaskTrack-RCNN uses a ResNet-50 backbone, we also applied this backbone to our network and still improve the AP from 30.3 to 30.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS):</head><p>Here we again adapt the network for category prediction as required by the task formulation. We outline the results of comparing our method with TrackR-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and Un-OVOST <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> in Tab. 4. Current top-performing method on MOTS is the twostage network that extends Mask-RCNN with a re-id head, trained to learn an appearance embedding vector for each object detection, used for data association. Our method achieves the highest sMOTSA score (50.4) on the pedestrian class, but TrackR-CNN performs better on the car class. However, for both classes, STEm-Seg suffers significantly fewer ID switches (IDS) compared to TrackR-CNN (76 vs. 93 for the car class and 14 vs. 78 for the pedestrian class). This measure is of particular interest to the tracking community since it directly reflects temporal association accuracy.</p><p>Similar to UnOVOST <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, TrackR-CNN does not generalize well to other tasks. To validate this, we retrained TrackR-CNN on the YT-VIS dataset. However, the resulting AP was less than 10. We assume this is due to TrackR-CNN that is forced to use a 14 × 14 ROI-Align layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> due to memory constraints. This results in coarse segmentation masks which are heavily penalized by the AP measure. Furthermore, the ReID-based embeddings can only learn an ap-pearance model, which is a limitation in YT-VIS where similar looking objects often occur in the same scene.  Finally, we apply our method to the DAVIS'16 unsupervised benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, where the task is to produce a binary segmentation for the salient regions in a given video clip. Since separating object instances is not required, we simplify our network to one decoder with two output channels trained for binary segmentation using a bootstrapped cross-entropy loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> on randomly selected clips from the YT-VIS and DAVIS datasets. Although competing methods are specifically engineered for this task, our simple setup obtains state-of-the-art results (Tab. 5). We note that while AGNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> and AD-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> use a stronger DeepLabv3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> backbone, we use additional video data for training. This is needed as we work with 3D input volumes. Since we do not perform post-processing, we report results from AD-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> without their DAVIS-specific post-processing for a fair comparison.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed a novel bottom-up approach for instance segmentation in videos which models video clips as 3D space-time volumes and then separates object instances by clustering learned embeddings. We enhanced the feature representation of these embeddings using novel mixing functions which yield considerable performance improvements over existing formulations. We applied our method to multiple, diverse datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results under both category-aware and category-agnostic settings. We further showed that, compared to existing dataset-specific state-of-the-arts, our approach generalizes much better across different datasets. Finally, we validated our network's temporal context learning ability by performing a separate experiment on video saliency detection and showed that our good results also generalize there.</p><p>help with experiments and Francis Engelmann, Theodora Kontogianni, Paul Voigtlaender, Gulliem Brasó and Aysim Toker for helpful discussions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L total = L emb + L smooth + L center ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>here L smooth is the variance smoothness loss, which ensures that the network outputs uniform variance values for every object instance. For example, if the network outputs the set of variances V j for the j th instance in a video clip, then the variance smoothness loss for this set of variances is denoted by L j smooth and is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L j smooth = 1 |V j | v∈Vj (v −v) 2 ,</formula><p>wherev is the mean of the variances in V j . Likewise, the loss can be computed for all object instances in the video clip and averaged. No loss is applied to the variances output for background pixels. L center is a regression loss, which ensures that pixels belonging to a foreground object instance have probability values in the instance center heat map H that match the probability obtained by applying Eq. 2 (main text) to the embedding vector at that pixel location.</p><p>L emb is the embedding loss, and is computed using the Lovàsz extension of the hinge loss for binary segmentation, as explained below.</p><p>The Lovàsz Hinge Loss: We use the Lovàsz Hinge Loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to train the embeddings output by our network (L emb ). It is a convex surrogate of the Jaccard index which directly optimizes the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and the ground truth object mask tubes, thereby alleviating class imbalance issues that arise from using, e.g., the cross-entropy loss. In practice, we apply the Lovàsz Hinge loss for binary segmentation. For a given video object instance prediction, we use F to denote the set of scores for each pixel in the video 1 , and denote by ∆ J the set of incorrect pixel predictions 2 . The loss L emb can then be computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L emb (F ) =∆ J (h(F )),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where∆ J is the Lovàsz extension of ∆ J , and h is the hinge loss associated with a binary prediction. Here we provide only a high-level description of the loss function. For a more detailed explanation of this loss we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Implementation Details</head><p>Hardware: We train our network using a batch size of 2 on a workstation with 2 Nvidia RTX TITAN GPUs and 64GB RAM. All inference experiments were performed on a workstation with a single Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU and 32GB RAM.</p><p>Training Schedule: For all tasks, the network is trained using an SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10 −3 . The learning rate is initially constant and then starts to decay exponentially after a certain number of iterations up to 10 −5 . The exact number of iterations varies for each setting as follows:</p><p>-DAVIS'19 Unsupervised: 60k total iterations, decay begins after 20k iterations. -YouTube-VIS: 150k total iterations, decay begins after 60k iterations.</p><p>-KITTI-MOTS: 100k total iterations, decay begins after 40k iterations.</p><p>Image Augmented Sequences: As mentioned in Sec. 4.1, we train our network on clips from actual video data in addition to sequences that have been synthesized from static images using random affine transformations and motion blur. Doing so allows us to utilize a large amount of publicly available image instance segmentation data (e.g., COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, Pascal-VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Mapillary Vistas <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>) for training purposes. We experimentally verified the performance benefit of incorporating such data in Sec. 4.3.</p><p>These augmentations were applied using the imgaug 3 library, which, in addition to various transformations, also provides a built-in function that simulates image blur caused by camera motion. The affine transformations we apply consist of rotations in the range [−10 • , 10 • ], translations of up to 10% of the image dimension along each axis, and scale variations in the range [0.8, 1.2]. We also apply small random offsets to the hue and saturation values of each image. All random transformations are independent of one another, i.e., we do not try to simulate consistent motion by sequentially applying the same transformation multiple times.</p><p>Video Data Augmentation: For training clips sampled from actual video data, random horizontal flipping is the only augmentation used. This is applied randomly to entire clips and not to individual frames within clips.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Baselines for DAVIS'19 Unsupervised</head><p>In Sec. 4.2 we compared our method to two simple proposal-based baselines: optical flow tracker (OF-Tracker) and Re-ID tracker (RI-Tracker), in addition to other published methods on DAVIS'19 unsupervised benchmark. For both, we generate per-frame mask proposals M ∈ {m 1 , ..., m n } for all the objects in a video using a ResNet-101 based Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. To ensure a fair  comparison with our approach, we train the Mask R-CNN jointly on YouTube-VIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, DAVIS'19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and augmented images from COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, as well as Pascal-VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> dataset for 120k iterations. This network is initialized with weights from a model trained for image instance segmentation on COCO. We use SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 10 −3 with exponential decay. The mask proposals generated by this re-trained Mask R-CNN network are then linked over time using optical flow and re-id for OF-Tracker and RI-Tracker, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OF-Tracker:</head><p>We use PWC-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> to generate optical flow for each subsequent pair of frames in the DAVIS'19 validation set. The optical flow is then used to warp m i+1 onto m i for each frame pair {i, i+1} to generate a set of warped masks per-frame W ∈ {w 1 , ..., w n−1 } for a video sequence. A simple linear assignment based on object overlap between the warped frame w i and the proposal m i is then used to associate the objects in the adjacent video frames. The associated object IDs are further propagated forward throughout the video sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RI-Tracker:</head><p>For the RI-Tracker, we train a re-id network with a ResNet-50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> backbone on the DAVIS'19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> training set. The network is trained using a batch hard triplet loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> on randomly selected triplets from a random video sequence for 25k iterations. This network is then used to generate re-id vectors for all the object proposals in M , which are further associated over time using linear assignment based on the Euclidean distance between embedding vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Extended Ablations for Embedding Mixing Function</head><p>In Sec. 4.3, we ablated the impact of using different mixing functions φ(·) that modify the embedding representation as discussed in Sec. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> It can be seen that both DAVIS'19 and YouTube-VIS give consistent results: for the same number of total embedding dimensions (E), having a free dimension is more beneficial than having a temporal coordinate dimension. For KITTI-MOTS, however, the trend differs. In particular, we obtain similar performance with φ xyt (72.5 and 48.9 sMOTSA on the car and pedestrian class, respectively) and φ xyff (73.2 and 47.3 sMOTSA). In Tab. 4 (main text), we reported the results for φ xyt since the mean sMOTSA score for the two categories (60.70) is slightly better than that of φ xyff <ref type="bibr">(60.25)</ref>. We attribute this difference in part to the fact that the temporal coordinate is a more useful feature for instance separation in KITTI-MOTS than in DAVIS'19 due to the fact that object instances undergo faster motion and often enter/exit the scene mid-way through a video clip. Furthermore, the performance trends for the car and pedestrian classes seem to follow different patterns, e.g., while φ xyfff yields the highest sMOTSA for the car class (73.4), it is significantly lower for the pedestrian class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. UnOVOST Training on KITTI-MOTS</head><p>In Sec. 4.2, we reported the performance of UnOVOST <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, the highest-scoring workshop submission for the DAVIS'19 Unsupervised Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, for the task of Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) using the KITTI-MOTS dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. We obtained the implementation from the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> and retrained and tuned the model as follows:</p><p>-We initialized a Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> network with a ResNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> backbone with weights from an off-the-shelf model trained for instance segmentation on the COCO dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. We then altered the output layers to predict two categories, i.e.. car and pedestrian, and trained the network for 60k iterations on Mapillary Vistas <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and KITTI-MOTS datasets. The training data and the backbone is thus identical to the one used for our STEm-Seg network. -We trained a ReID network on image instance crops from KITTI-MOTS using a triplet loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> and batch-hard sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The two most important hyper-parameters in UnOVOST are the IoU thresholds used for pruning object detections and for associating object detections based on optical flow, respectively. We performed a grid search for these two parameters on the KITTI-MOTS validation set in order to optimize the sMOTSA score. Our observation was that the UnOVOST framework is fairly insensitive to these parameters; however, the final scores on KITTI-MOTS are consistently low (see Tab. 4 in the paper). Qualitative analysis of the results showed that the ReID network frequently makes spurious associations. We postulate that this is because object instances in KITTI-MOTS frequently have similar appearances. This differs from the object instances in DAVIS whose appearances usually differ since they span a large variety of object classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Adaptation of TrackR-CNN to YouTube-VIS</head><p>As discussed in Sec. 4.2, we adapted the publicly available implementation 4 of TrackR-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> to the task of Video Instance Segmentation and evaluated it on the Youtube-VIS dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. To this end, we initialized the parameters of the network, which overlap with Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> with weights from a model trained for instance segmentation on COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and Mapillary Vistas <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>In the original implementation, a class-specific re-identification embedding head was used. This was feasible for KITTI-MOTS, where there are only two object classes. In YouTube-VIS, however, there are 40 object classes, and several occur infrequently in the dataset. Furthermore, video sequences are significantly shorter, and there are usually only 1-2 objects of the same class present in a video clip. For that reason, we adapted the TrackR-CNN architecture and kept a single ReID head that is shared among all object classes. We trained the network under this setting using a batch size of 8 images for 400k iterations and evaluated multiple intermediate checkpoints. Despite these efforts, the highest AP score obtained was less than 10%.</p><p>A major performance bottleneck we identified is a low-resolution 14x14 RoI-Align <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> layer used in TrackR-CNN that limit the memory usage to a reasonable level. This suffices for KITTI-MOTS, which contains small pedestrian instances and cars with simple shapes, but results in very coarse segmentation masks on the YouTube-VIS dataset which contains a diverse set of objects that cover a large area of the image. The AP measure heavily penalizes such coarse segmentation as it is computed by taking the average over a set of IoU thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95.</p></div>

Additional Qualitative Results</head><p>In this section, we provide additional qualitative results on the validation split of all three datasets, DAVIS'19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, YouTube-VIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> and KITTI-MOTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.
