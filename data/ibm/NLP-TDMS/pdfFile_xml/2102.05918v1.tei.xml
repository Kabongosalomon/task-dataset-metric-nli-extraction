<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as Ima-geNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the existing literature, visual and vision-language representation learning are mostly studied separately with different training data sources. In the vision domain, pre-training on large-scale supervised data such as ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deng et al., 2009)</ref>, OpenImages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kuznetsova et al., 2020)</ref>, and JFT-300M <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sun et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kolesnikov et al., 2020)</ref> has proven to be critical for improving performance on downstream tasks via transfer learning. Curation of such pre-training datasets requires heavy work on data gathering, sampling, and human annotation, and hence is difficult to scale.</p><p>Pre-training has also become the de-facto approach in vision-language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2020c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Li et al., 2020)</ref>. However, vision-language pre-training datasets such as Conceptual Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sharma et al., 2018)</ref>, Visual Genome Dense Captions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Krishna et al., 2016)</ref>, and ImageBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Qi et al., 2020)</ref> require even heavier work on human annotation, semantic parsing, cleaning and balancing. As a result, the scales of these datasets are only in the realm of ∼10M examples. This is at least an order of magnitude smaller than their counterparts in the vision domain, and much smaller than large corpora of text from the internet for NLP pre-training (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Devlin et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Radford et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yang et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liu et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Raffel et al. (2020)</ref>).</p><p>In this work, we leverage a dataset of over one billion noisy image alt-text pairs to scale visual and vision-language representation learning. We follow the procedures described in the Conceptual Captions dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sharma et al., 2018)</ref> to have a large noisy dataset. But instead of applying the complex filtering and post-processing steps as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sharma et al., 2018)</ref> to clean the dataset, we only apply simple frequency-based filtering. The resulting dataset is noisy, but is two orders of magnitude larger than the Conceptual Captions dataset. We show that visual and visionlanguage representations pre-trained on our exascale dataset achieve very strong performance on a wide range of tasks.</p><p>To train our model, we use an objective that aligns the visual and language representations in a shared latent embedding space using a simple dual-encoder architecture. Similar ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deng et al. 2009)</ref> figure credit to <ref type="bibr">(Krizhevsky et al. 2012)</ref> Flickr30k <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Plummer et al. 2015)</ref>, MSCOCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al. 2015)</ref>, ... ) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A summary of our method, ALIGN. Visual and language representations are jointly learned from noisy image alt-text data. The representations can be used for vision-only or vision-language task transfer. Without any fine-tuning, ALIGN powers cross-modal search including image-to-text search, text-to-image search and even search with joint image+text queries.</p></div>

We name our model ALIGN: A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding. Image and text encoders are learned via a contrastive loss (formulated as normalized softmax) that pushes the embeddings of matched image-text pair together while pushing those of non-matched image-text pair apart. This is one of the most effective loss functions for both self-supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2020b)</ref> and supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zhai &amp; Wu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Musgrave et al., 2020)</ref> representation learning. Considering paired texts as fine-grained labels of images, our image-to-text contrastive loss is analogous to the conventional label-based classification objective; and the key difference is that the text encoder generates the "label" weights.

Besides using different vision and language encoder architectures, the key difference is on training data: ALIGN follows the natural distribution of image-text pairs from the raw alt-text data, while CLIP collects the dataset by first constructing an allowlist of high-frequency visual concepts from English Wikipedia. We demonstrate that strong visual and vision-language representations can be learned with a dataset that doesn't require expert knowledge to curate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Large-Scale Noisy Image-Text Dataset</head><p>The focus of our work is to scale up visual and visionlanguage representation learning. For this purpose, we resort to a much larger dataset than existing ones. Specifically, we follow the methodology of constructing Conceptual Captions dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sharma et al., 2018)</ref> to get a version of raw English alt-text data (image and alt-text pairs). The Conceptual Captions dataset was cleaned by heavy filtering and post-processing. Here, for the purpose of scaling, we trade quality for scale by relaxing most of the cleaning steps in the original work. Instead, we only apply minimal frequency-based filtering as detailed below. The result is a much larger (1.8B image-text pairs) but noisier dataset. Image-based filtering. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sharma et al. (2018)</ref>, we remove pornographic images and keep only images whose shorter dimension is larger than 200 pixels and aspect ratio is smaller than 3. Images with more than 1000 associated alt-texts are discarded. To ensure that we don't train on test images, we also remove duplicates or near-duplicates of test images in all downstream evaluation datasets (e.g., ILSVRC-2012, Flickr30K, and MSCOCO).</p><p>Text-based filtering. We exclude alt-texts that are shared by more than 10 images. These alt-texts are often irrelevant to the content of the images (e.g., "1920x1080", "alt img", and "cristina"). We also discard alt-texts that contain any rare token (outside of 100 million most frequent unigrams and bigrams from the raw dataset), and those that are either too short (&lt;3 unigrams) or too long (&gt;20 unigrams). This removes noisy texts like "image tid 25&amp;id mggqpuwe-qdpd&amp;cache 0&amp;lan code 0", or texts that are too generic to be useful.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Pre-training on Noisy Image-Text Pairs</head><p>We pre-train ALIGN using a dual-encoder architecture. The model consists of a pair of image and text encoders with a cosine-similarity combination function at the top. We use EfficientNet with global pooling (without training the 1x1 conv layer in the classification head) as the image encoder and BERT with [CLS] token embedding as the text embedding encoder (we generate 100k wordpiece vocabulary from our training dataset). A fully-connected layer with linear activation is added on top of BERT encoder to match the dimension from the image tower. Both image and text encoders are trained from scratch.</p><p>The image and text encoders are optimized via normalized softmax loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zhai &amp; Wu, 2019)</ref>. In training, we treat matched image-text pairs as positive and all other random image-text pairs that can be formed in a training batch as negative.</p><p>We minimize the sum of two losses: one for image-to-text classification</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Li2t = − 1 N N i log exp(x i yi/σ) N j=1 exp(x i yj/σ)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and the other for text-to-image classification</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Lt2i = − 1 N N i log exp(y i xi/σ) N j=1 exp(y i xj/σ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, x i and y j are the normalized embedding of image in the i-th pair and that of text in the j-th pair, respectively. N is the batch size, and σ is the temperature to scale the logits. For in-batch negatives to be more effective, we concatenate embeddings from all computing cores to form a much larger batch. The temperature variable is crucial as both image and text embeddings are L2-normalized. Instead of manually sweeping for the optimal temperature value, we find that it can be effectively learned together with all the other parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Transferring to Image-Text Matching &amp; Retrieval</head><p>We evaluate ALIGN models on image-to-text and text-toimage retrieval tasks, with and without finetuning. Two benchmark datasets are considered: Flickr30K <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Plummer et al., 2015)</ref> and MSCOCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2015)</ref>. We also evaluate ALIGN on Crisscrossed Captions (CxC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Parekh et al., 2021)</ref>, which is an extension of MSCOCO with additional human semantic similarity judgments for caption-caption, image-image, and image-caption pairs. With extended annotations, CxC enables four intra-and inter-modal retrieval tasks including image-to-text, text-toimage, text-to-text, and image-to-image retrieval, and three semantic similarity tasks including semantic textual similarity (STS), semantic image similarity (SIS), and semantic image-text similarity (SITS). As the training set is identical to the original MSCOCO, we can directly evaluate the MSCOCO fine-tuned ALIGN model on CxC annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Transferring to Visual Classification</head><p>We also transfer the image encoder to downstream visual classification tasks. For this purpose, we use the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deng et al., 2009</ref>) as well as a handful of smaller fine-grained classification datasets such as Oxford Flowers-102 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nilsback &amp; Zisserman, 2008)</ref>, Oxford-IIIT Pets <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Parkhi et al., 2012)</ref>, Stanford Cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Krause et al., 2013)</ref>, and Food101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bossard et al., 2014)</ref>. For ImageNet, results from two settings are reported: training the top classification layer only (with frozen ALIGN image encoder) and fully fine-tuned. Only the latter setting is reported for fine-grained classification benchmarks. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kolesnikov et al. (2020)</ref>, we also evaluate the robustness of our model on Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB)  which consists of 19 diverse (covering subgroups of natural, specialized and structured image classification tasks) visual classification tasks with 1000 training samples each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments and Results</head><p>We train our ALIGN models from scratch, using the opensourced implementation of EfficientNet as the image encoder and BERT as the text encoder. Unless in the ablation study, we use the results of ALIGN where the image encoder is EfficientNet-L2 and the text encoder is BERT-Large. The image encoder is trained at resolution of 289 × 289 pixels no matter what EfficientNet variant is used. We first resize input images to 346 × 346 resolution and then perform random crop (with additional random horizontal flip) in training and central crop in evaluation. For BERT we use wordpiece sequence of maximum 64 tokens since the input texts are no longer than 20 unigrams. The softmax temperature variable is initialized as 1.0 (this temperature variable is shared between image-to-text loss and text-to-image loss) and we use 0.1 as label smoothing parameter in the softmax losses.</p><p>We use LAMB optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(You et al., 2020</ref>) 1 with weight decay ratio 1e-5. The learning rate is warmed up linearly to 1e-3 from zero in 10k steps, and then linearly decay to zero in 1.2M steps (∼12 epochs). We train the model on 1024 Cloud TPUv3 cores with 16 positive pairs on each core. Therefore the total effective batch size is 16384.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Image-Text Matching &amp; Retrieval Results</head><p>We evaluate ALIGN on Flickr30K and MSCOCO crossmodal retrieval benchmarks, in both zero-shot and fully fine-tuned settings. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Karpathy &amp; Fei-Fei, 2015)</ref> and most existing works to obtain the train/test splits. During fine-tuning, the same loss function is used. But there can be false negatives when the batch size is comparable to the total number of training samples. So we reduce the global batch size from 16384 to 2048. We also reduce the initial learning rate to 1e-5 and train for 3K and 6K steps (with linear decay) respectively on Flickr30K and MSCOCO. All the other hyper-parameters are kept the same as pre-training. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows that, compared to previous works, ALIGN achieves SOTA results in all metrics of Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks. In the zero-shot setting, ALIGN gets more than 7% improvement in image retrieval task compared to the previous SOTA, CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Radford et al., 2021)</ref>. With fine-tuning, ALIGN outperforms all existing methods by a large margin, including those that employ more complex cross-modal attention layers such as ImageBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Qi et al., 2020)</ref>, UNITER <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., 2020c)</ref>, ERNIE-ViL <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yu et al., 2020)</ref>, VILLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gan et al., 2020)</ref> and Oscar . <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports the performance of ALIGN on Crisscrossed Captions (CxC) retrieval tasks. Again, ALIGN achieves SOTA results in all metrics, especially by a large margin on image-to-text (+22.2% R@1) and text-to-image (20.1% R@1) tasks. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows that ALIGN also outperforms the previous SOTA on SITS task with an improvement of 5.7%. One interesting observation is that, despite being much better on inter-modal tasks, ALIGN is not as impressive on intra-modal tasks. For instance, the improvements on text-to-text and image-to-image retrieval tasks (in particular the former) are less significant compared to those on image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. The performance on STS and SIS tasks is also slightly worse than VSE++ and DE I2T . We suspect it is because the training objective of ALIGN focuses on cross-modal (image-text) matching instead of intra-modal matching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Parekh et al. (2021)</ref> suggest multitask learning could produce more balanced representations. We leave it to the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Visual Classification Results</head><p>On the ImageNet benchmark, we first freeze the learned visual features and only train the classification head. Afterwards we fine-tune all layers. We use basic data augmentations including random cropping (same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Szegedy et al. (2015)</ref>) and horizontal flip. In evaluation we apply a single central crop with ratio of 0.875. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Touvron et al. (2019)</ref>, we use 0.8 scale ratio between training and evaluation to mitigate the resolution discrepancy introduced by random crop. Specifically, train/eval resolution is 289/360 with frozen visual features, and is 475/600 when fine-tuning all variables.</p><p>In both stages of training, we use a global batch size of 1024, SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9, and learning rate decayed every 30 epochs with ratio 0.2 (100 epochs in total). Weight decay is set to zero. With frozen visual features, we use the initial learning rate of 0.1. When fine-tuning all layers with use the initial learning rate of 0.01, and use 10x smaller learning rate on the backbone network compared to the classification head. In VTAB eval, we follow a hyper-parameter sweep as shown in the Appendix I in  with 50 trials for each task. Each task is trained on 800 images and the hyperparameters are selected using the validation set of 200 images. After the sweep, the selected hyperparameters are used to train on the combined training and validation splits of 1000 images for each task. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> reports the mean accuracy  <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mahajan et al., 2018)</ref>, CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Radford et al., 2021)</ref>, BiT , ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dosovitskiy et al., 2021)</ref>, NoisyStudent , and Meta-Pseudo-Labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pham et al., 2020</ref> (including the breakdown results on each subgroup) with standard deviation from three fine-tuning runs and shows that ALIGN outperforms BiT-L  with similar hyper-parameter selection method applied. To evaluate on smaller fine-grained classification benchmarks, we adopt a simple fine-tuning strategy for all tasks. We use the same data augmentation and optimizer as in Ima-geNet fine-tuning. Similarly, we first train the classification head and then fine-tune all layers, except with batch norm statistics frozen. The train/eval resolution is fixed at 289/360. We use batch size 256 and weight decay 1e-5. The initial learning rate is set to 1e-2 and 1e-3 respectively, with cosine learning rate decay in 20k steps. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> compares ALIGN with BiT-L  and SAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Foret et al., 2021)</ref> which both apply same fine-tuning hyper-parameters for all tasks. 2 For small tasks like these, details in finetuning matter. So we list the baseline results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Foret et al., 2021)</ref> without using SAM optimization for a fairer comparison. Our result (average of three runs) is comparable to the SOTA results without tweaking on optimization algorithms. </p></div>

We train EfficientNet from B1 to B7 for the image encoder and BERT-Mini to BERT-Large for the text encoder. We add an additional fully-connected layer with linear activation on top of B1, B3 and B5 globally-pooled features to match the output dimension of B7 (640). A similar linear layer is added to all text encoders.</p><p>Figures 3 shows MSCOCO zero-shot retrieval and ImageNet KNN results with different combinations of image and text backbones. Model quality improves nicely with larger backbones except that the ImageNet KNN metric starts to saturate from BERT-Base to BERT-Large with EfficientNet-B7. As expected, scaling up image encoder capacity is more important for vision tasks (e.g., even with BERT-Mini text tower, B7 performs better than B5 with BERT-Large). In image-text retrieval tasks the image and text encoder capacities are equally important. Based on the nice scaling property shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, we only train EfficientNet-L2 with BERT-Large as reported in Section 5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref> compares ALIGN-L2 with ALIGN-B7 (both with BERT-Large) on MSCOCO image-text retrieval and ImageNet classification results, showing additional quality gain from B7 to L2.</p><p>We then study key architecture hyperparameters including   Rows 2-4 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref> show that model performance improves with higher embedding dimensions. Hence, we let the dimension scale with larger EfficientNet backbone (L2 uses 1376). Rows 5 and 6 show that using fewer in-batch negatives (50% and 25%) in the softmax loss will degrade the performance. Rows 7-9 study the effect of the temperature parameter in the softmax loss. Compared to the baseline model that learns the temperature parameter (converged to about 1/64), some hand-selected, fixed temperatures could be slightly better. However, we choose to use the learnable temperature as it performs competitively and makes learning easier. . CC-3M is much smaller so we train the model with 1/10 of the default number of steps. All models are trained from scratch. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 9</ref>, a large scale training set is essential to allow scaling up of our models and to achieve better performance. For instance, models trained on ALIGN data clearly outperform those trained on CC-3M data. On CC-3M, B7+BERT-base starts to overfit and performs even worse than B3+BERT-mini.</p><p>Conversely, a larger model is required to fully utilize the larger dataset -the smaller B3+BERT-mini almost saturate at 10% of ALIGN data, while with the larger B7+BERTbase, there is a clear improvement with full ALIGN data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Analysis of Learned Embeddings</head><p>We build a simple image retrieval system to study the behaviors of embeddings trained by ALIGN. For demonstration purposes, we use an index consisting of 160M CC-BY licensed images that are separate from our training set. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the top 1 text-to-image retrieval results for a handful of text queries not existing in the training data. ALIGN can retrieve precise images given detailed descriptions of a scene, or fine-grained or instance-level concepts like landmarks and artworks. These examples demonstrate that our ALIGN model can align images and texts with similar semantics, and that ALIGN can generalize to novel complex concepts.</p><p>"Van Gogh Starry Night ..."</p><p>"details" "in black and white" "on a canvas" "in dark wood frame" "Lombard street ..."

We show that linear relationships between image and text embeddings also emerge in ALIGN. We perform image retrieval using a combined image+text query. Specifically, given a query image and a text string, we add their ALIGN embeddings together and use it to retrieve relevant images. 4 <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows results for a variety of image+text queries. These examples not only demonstrate great compositionality of ALIGN embeddings across vision and language domains, but also show the feasibility of a new paradigm of "search with multi-modal query" that would otherwise be hard using only text query or image query. For instance, one could now look for the "Australia" or "Madagascar" equivalence of pandas, or turn a pair of black shoes into identically-looking shoes with the color of "beige". Finally, as shown in the last three rows of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, removing objects/attributes from a scene is possible by performing subtraction in the embedding space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>We present a simple method of leveraging large-scale noisy image-text data to scale up visual and vision-language representation learning. Our method avoids heavy work on data curation and annotation, and only requires minimal frequency-based cleaning. On this dataset, we train a simple dual-encoder model using a contrastive loss. The resulting model, named ALIGN, is capable of cross-modal retrieval and significantly outperforms SOTA VSE and crossattention vision-language models. In visual-only downstream tasks, ALIGN is also comparable to or outperforms SOTA models trained with large-scale labeled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Social Impacts and Future Work</head><p>While this work shows promising results from a methodology perspective with a simple data collection method, additional analysis of the data and the resulting model is necessary before the use of the model in practice. For instance, considerations should be made towards the potential for the use of harmful text data in alt-texts to reinforce such harms. On the fairness front, data balancing efforts may be required to prevent reinforcing stereotypes from the web data. Additional testing and training around sensitive religious or cultural items should be taken to understand and mitigate the impact from possibly mislabeled data.</p><p>Further analysis should also be taken to ensure that the de-mographic distribution of humans and related cultural items like clothing, food, and art do not cause model performance to be skewed. Analysis and balancing would be required if such models will be used in production.</p><p>Finally, unintended misuse of such models for surveillance or other nefarious purposes should be prohibited.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>arXiv:2102.05918v1 [cs.CV] 11 Feb 2021 Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision</figDesc></figure>
