<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present ShelfNet, a novel architecture for accurate fast semantic segmentation. Different from the single encoder-decoder structure, ShelfNet has multiple encoder-decoder branch pairs with skip connections at each spatial level, which looks like a shelf with multiple columns. The shelf-shaped structure can be viewed as an ensemble of multiple deep and shallow paths, thus improving accuracy. We significantly reduce computation burden by reducing channel number, at the same time achieving high accuracy with this unique structure. In addition, we propose a shared-weight strategy in the residual block which reduces parameter number without sacrificing performance. Compared with popular non real-time methods such as PSPNet, our ShelfNet achieves 4× faster inference speed with similar accuracy on PASCAL VOC dataset. Compared with real-time segmentation models such as BiSeNet, our model achieves higher accuracy at comparable speed on the Cityscapes Dataset, enabling the application in speed-demanding tasks such as street-scene understanding for autonomous driving. Furthermore, our ShelfNet achieves 79.0% mIoU on Cityscapes Dataset with ResNet34 backbone, outperforming PSPNet and BiSeNet with large backbones such as ResNet101. Through extensive experiments, we validated the superior performance of ShelfNet. We provide link to the implementation https://github.com/ juntang-zhuang/ShelfNet-lw-cityscapes.</p></div>

The task of semantic segmentation is to assign each pixel a unique class label, and can be viewed as a dense classification problem. Recently many convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable results on semantic segmentation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref>]. However, the success of most deep learning models for semantic segmentation comes at a price of heavy computation burden. The training of CNNs on a large dataset such as PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Cityscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> typically takes several days on a single GPU, and the running time during test phase is usually hundreds of milliseconds (ms) or more, which hinders their application in time-efficiency demanding tasks.</p><p>Real-time semantic segmentation has important applications, e.g., street scene understanding and autonomous driving. Prior research on accelerating semantic segmentation includes removing redundancy of deep neural networks through pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, the running speed of these methods is typically insufficient for fast semantic segmentation. Another way to get faster running speed is to use a smaller model keeping the same structure, but this strategy would inevitably yield lower accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Therefore, we aim to propose a new architecture for fast segmentation while maintaining satisfying accuracy.</p><p>Most state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models belong to the family of single "encoder-decoder" structure, where the image is progressively down-sampled then upsampled. Here, we propose ShelfNet, which employs a different structure like a multi-column shelf. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(a)</ref>, multi-scale features encoded by different stages of a CNN backbone (e.g. ResNet) are fed into the "segmentation shelf". The segmentation shelf comprises of multiple encoder-decoder pairs with skip connections at each spatial resolution level. The unique structure increases the number of paths to improve information flow in the network, thus increasing the segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate the high accuracy and fast running speed of our ShelfNet on PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and Cityscapes datasets.</p><p>Our main contributions are listed as follows: 1. We propose a novel architecture, ShelfNet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>, for accurate and fast semantic segmentation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Semantic Segmentation</head><p>Semantic segmentation has been a hot topic for many years. Before the recent rise of deep learning, early approaches mainly relied on handcrafted features such as HOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and SIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Since the resurgence of deep learning, especially fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, deep learning models have been widely used for semantic segmentation.</p><p>Like FCN, many models such as U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, RefineNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> also have an encoder-decoder structure, and use a "convolution-downsample" strategy for the encoder. The downsample layer reduces spatial resolution and increases channel number. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> based on dilated convolution. Instead of down-sampling, a dilated CNN gradually increases dilation rate to increase the size of receptive field, but does not shrink the size of the output tensor. Therefore, compared with the "conv-downsample" strategy, the dilated CNN has a better spatial resolution at a higher computation cost. For example, a standard ResNet shrinks image size to 1/32 of input size, while a dilated ResNet shrinks image size to 1/4 of input size. State-of-the-art networks, such as DeepLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, PSPNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and EncNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, are based on dilated CNN, and thus are not suitable for timeefficiency demanding tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Real-time Semantic Segmentation</head><p>There have been several approaches for real-time semantic segmentation by modifying a large network to a light-weight version. For example, ICNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> is a modification of PSPNet and deals with multiple image scales, but the robustness to low-resolution is not extensively validated. Light-Weight RefineNet is a modification of Re-fineNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where the kernel sizes of some convolutional layers are reduced from 3 × 3 to 1 × 1. However, most of the real-time models, such as GUN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, EffConv <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and ENet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, achieve high running speed at the cost of low accuracy. The recently proposed BiSeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> uses a shallow branch to capture spatial information, and a deep branch to capture context information. However, it's difficult for BiSeNet to deal with high-level features combined from different branches. All models mentioned in this paragraph can be viewed as modifications of the encoderdecoder structure. In this project, we propose a network with multiple encoder-decoder pairs (e.g. columns 3 and 4 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>) and skip connections at different spatial levels (e.g. rows A-D in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>), and demonstrate its superior performance over previous methods both in inference speed and segmentation accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Structure of ShelfNet</head><p>We propose ShelfNet, a multi-column convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  1</ref>. Different from the standard single encoder-decoder structure, our shelf-structure network introduces more paths to improve the information flow.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1,</ref> our ShelfNet relies on a backbone network. Different CNN architectures can be used as the backbone, such as ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Xception <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and DenseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The backbone outputs feature maps of different spatial scales, named as rows A to D in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. Take ResNet backbone for example, the spatial sizes of feature maps are 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 of the input size at levels A-D, respectively. Feature maps encoded by different stages of the backbone are fed into the segmentation shelf.</p><p>The segmentation shelf has a shelf-shaped multi-column structure where columns are named with numbers 1 to 4. We name column 3 as an encoder branch (down-sample branch), and name column 2 and 4 as decoder branches (upsample branch). Between adjacent columns (e.g. column 3 and 4), there are skip connections at different spatial scale stages (A-D).</p><p>Stage-wise features encoded by column 1 are then passed to succeeding Shared-weight blocks (S-block) in column 2. The S-Block serves as a residual-block but with fewer parameters. Here, the S-block combines the features passed from the vertical direction and lateral direction. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(b)</ref>, the two inputs are first summed up before feeding into the succeeding part. For the exception at A3 and D4 where there is only one input, the summing up step is skipped. As a residual-block, the input and output of a S-block has the same shape.</p><p>For the encoder branch at column 3, the feature maps are passed into a convolution layer with a stride of 2 (conv stride in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>), to halve the spatial size and double the channel number (e.g. B3 to C3). Similarly, in the decoder branches at column 2 and 4, feature maps are passed into a transposed convolution layer (conv trans in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>) with a stride of 2, to double the spatial size and halve the channel number (e.g. C2 to B2). Finally, output from block A4 goes through a 1 × 1 convolutional layer and a softmax operation to generate the final segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Channel Reduction for Faster Inference Speed</head><p>The backbone feature maps typically have a large channel number (e.g. 2048 at level D for ResNet50). For faster inference speed, we reduce the number of feature map channels with 1 × 1 convolution followed by a batch-norm layer and ReLU activation (e.g. for ResNet50, channel number of feature maps are reduced from 256, 512, 1024, 2048 to 64, 128, 256, 512 for levels A-D respectively). As shown in column 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, channel number is reduced by a 1 × 1 convolution, batch-normalization and ReLU activation.</p><p>We theoretically show that reducing channel number significantly improves inference speed. The computation burden of a convolution with stride 1 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H × W × K 2 × C in × C out ,</formula><p>where H, W are spatial sizes, K is the kernel size, and C in are C out are channel number of input and output respectively. Simply reducing C in and C out by a factor of 4 quadratically reduces the computation burden to <ref type="bibr">1 16</ref> . Even with two extra columns in the shelf structure, the computation burden is 2 × 1 16 = 1 8 , thus is faster. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">ShelfNet as an Ensemble of FCNs</head><p>ShelfNet can also be viewed as an ensemble of FCNs. Andreas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> argued that ResNet behaves like an ensemble of shallow networks, because the residual connections provide multiple paths for efficient information flow. Similarly, ShelfNet provides multiple paths of information flow. For ease of representation, we denote backbone as column 0 and list a few paths here as an example as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">: (1) (Blue line in Fig. 2) A0 → A1 → A2 → A3 → A4, (2) (Green line in Fig. 2) A0 → A1 → A2 → A3 → B3 → C3 → C4 → B4 → A4, (3) (Red line in Fig. 2)A0 → B0 → B1 → B2 → A2 → A3 → A4, (4) (Orange line in Fig. 2) A0 → B0 → C0 → D0 → D1 → D2 → C2 → B2 → B3 → C3 → C4 → B4 → A4.</formula><p>Each path can be viewed as a variant of FCN (except that there are pooling layers in ResNet backbone). Therefore, ShelfNet has the potential to capture more complicated features and produce higher accuracy.</p><p>The effective number of FCN paths in ShelfNet is much larger than SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which is a single encoder-decoder pair with skip connections. The total number of paths grows exponentially with the number of encoder-decoder pairs (e.g columns 0 and 2, 3 and 4 are two pairs) and the number of spatial levels (e.g., A to D in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). Not considering the effective paths generated from residual connections in backbone, for a SegNet with 4 spatial levels (A-D), the total number of FCN paths is 4; for a ShelfNet with the same spatial levels, the total number of FCN paths is 29. The unique structure of ShelfNet significantly increases the number of effective FCN paths, thus achieving a higher accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Ensemble of Deep and Shallow Paths</head><p>GridNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> also has a multi-column structure. We illustrate the key difference between ShelfNet and GridNet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> by simplifying the structure. When stacking the same number of encoder-decoder blocks, the information path in ShelfNet can go much deeper. For example, the deepest path in ShelfNet goes through all 16 blocks, while GridNet can only use 10 blocks. The difference in depth is even bigger with more "downsample-upsample" branch pairs. Our ShelfNet takes advantage of ensemble information from a variety of shallow and deep paths, like the success of ResNet. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Shared-weights Residual Block (S-block)</head><p>Compared with SegNet, the larger effective number of FCN paths comes at a price of extra blocks. To reduce the model size, we propose a modified residual block (S-Block) as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(b)</ref>. Here we use it only in the segmentation shelf. The two convolutional layers in the same block share the same weights while the two batch normalization layers are different. The shared-weights design that reuses weights of convolution is similar to the recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and recursive convolutional network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A drop-out layer is added between two convolutional layers to avoid overfitting. The sharedweights residual block combines the strength of skip connection, recurrent convolution and drop-out regularization while using many fewer parameters than a standard residual block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments and Results</head><p>We carried out extensive experiments to validate the fast inference speed and high accuracy of ShelfNet on three public datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context and Cityscapes. Performance is measured by mean intersection over union (mIoU). To test inference speed, we feed a single image to the network, and measure the mean running time of 100 repetitions. We first introduce the datasets and inplementation details, then provide an ablation analysis for ShelfNet, finally we compare the performance with stateof-the-art methods.</p></div>

We use the augmented PASCAL VOC dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> containing 10582, 1449 and 1456 images for training, validation and test set. MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is also used as extra training data to generate higher accuracy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Cityscapes</head><p>Cityscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> consists of images for 50 cities in different seasons and are annotated with 19 categories. It contains 2975, 500 and 1525 fine-labeled images for training, validation and test respectively. More than 20,000 images with coarse annotations are also provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Implementation Details</head><p>All models are implemented with PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Learning rate is scheduled in the form lr = baselr × (1 − iter total iter ) power with power = 0.9 as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and crossentropy loss is used. The weight-decay is set as 10 −4 . For Pascal VOC, the model is first trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer on MS COCO dataset for 30 epochs with a base learning rate of 0.01, then trained on PASCAL augmented dataset for 50 epochs with a base learning rate of 0.001, and finally fine-tuned on original PASCAL VOC dataset for 50 epochs with a base learning rate of 0.0001. For PASCAL-Context, we train our model with SGD optimizer for 80 epochs with cross-entropy loss. The base learning rate is set as 0.001. For Cityscapes dataset, we train the model using fine-labelled images, with an initial learning rate of 0.01.</p><p>For data augmentation, the image is randomly flipped and scaled between 0.5 to 2. The images are also randomly rotated between -10 and 10 degrees. The image is cropped into size 512 × 512 for PASCAL VOC and PASCAL Context datasets, and cropped into 1536 × 768 for Cityscapes dataset. For final prediction results, we predict the segmentation masks on multi-scale inputs ranging from 0.5 to 2 and calculate their average.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Ablation Study for Structure</head><p>We conduct the ablation analysis on PASCAL VOC validation dataset, and train all models with the same strategy as in Sec. 4.1.4. The results are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Numbers after model name represent which column in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> is present.</p><p>First we show the shelf-shaped structure, which increases the number of paths for information flow, is the key to high performance. Compared with FCN, SegNet uses columns 0,1 and 2, and uses low-level features, thus generating a higher mIoU. We use W-Net which has a similar structure compared to ShelfNet, except skip connections between (B2,C2) and (B3,C3) are removed in W-Net. W-Net is equivalent to stacked hourglass network (SHN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The number of paths for information flow from input to output has the following order: ShelfNet&gt;W-Net&gt; SegNet&gt;FCN, and we observe the same order of segmentation accuracy, which validates our argument.</p><p>We further validate that the improvement in accuracy comes from increased number of paths, not increased number of parameters. We reduce the number of channels in a ShelfNet by half (e.g. reduce from 64 to 32 channels for A2), but keep the backbone unchanged. This reduces the parameter number from 38.7M to 29.2M, but generates a comparable result (mIoU drops from 88.26% to 85.52%), and the result is much better compared to FCN with more parameters (35.0M).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Shared-weights Blocks (S-Block)</head><p>We evaluate the effect of Shared-weights blocks (S-blocks) by replacing S-blocks in the segmentation shelf with notshared-weight version of residual blocks. Both versions use the same ResNet50 backbone provided by PyTorch official website <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Both models are trained with SGD optimizer on PASCAL augmented dataset for 50 epochs with a base  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> is present, and column 0 represents the backbone. For example, FCN only has a single column 0 followed by a convolution layer, SegNet has columns 0, 1 and 2, ShelfNet has columns 0 to 4 with skip connections between column 2 and 3, while W-Net has columns 0 to 4 without skip connections between (B2,C2) and (B3,C3).  learning rate of 0.01, and finally fine-tuned on original PAS-CAL VOC 2012 dataset for 50 epochs with a base learning rate of 0.001. We test them on the PASCAL VOC validation dataset, and results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. The shared-weight strategy reduces the number of parameters from 45.8M to 38.7M without sacrificing the accuracy. In our experiment the shared-weights strategy even generates a slightly higher mIoU (88.26%) compared to the conventional residual block (88.02%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Speed Analysis for Backbone</head><p>ShelfNet is a flexible architecture and can be used with various backbone models. We summarize the inference speed of different backbones in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, and show that dilated convolution significantly reduces the inference speed. "Dilated" means the network uses dilated convolution to increase receptive field instead of a pooling layer. The number of flops of a convolution layer is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Computation = C 1 × C 2 × K 1 × K 2 × H × W (1)</formula><p>where C 1 , C 2 are channel numbers of the input and output tensors, K 1 , K 2 are sizes of the kernel, and H, W are sizes of the feature map. A dilated convolution network will generate a larger H, W , therefore is computationally intensive. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, with the same network structure, a dilated version has about 5× larger computation burden. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks such as DeepLabv3 and PSPNet use dilated residual network as the backbone, while ShelfNet uses an undilated version. Therefore, ShelfNet is much faster. The speed up mainly comes from computation reduction of the backbone.  </p></div>

Compared to Re-fineNet and LWRF, the better performance with a much smaller backbone of ShelfNet validates the efficiency of the proposed shelf-like structure in feature extraction. Our ShelfNet with Resnet101 backbone achieves the highest accuracy (84.2%) compared to all RefineNet and LWRF models.</p><p>In addition to the higher accuracy, ShelfNet achieves faster inference speed compared with LWRF when using the same backbone. Unlike LWRF, our ShelfNet reduces channel number with a 1 × 1 convolution as in column 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. For levels A to D, LWRF uses 256, 256, 256, 512 channels, while in ShelfNet it's reduced to 64, 128, 256, 512. As mentioned in Sec. 3.2, the computation for a conv layer is H × W × K 2 × C 2 ,hence quadratically reduced to ( 64 256 ) 2 = 1 16 for level A; even with two more columns, overall the computation burden is reduced to 2 × 1 16 = 1 8 . Therefore, our ShelfNet is faster. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed ShelfNet for fast semantic segmentation, which has multiple pairs of encoder-decoder branches with skip connections between adjacent branches. The unique shelf-shaped structure enables multiple paths for information flow and achieves high accuracy; the shared-weight design in the S-block significantly reduces parameter number without sacrificing accuracy. We validated the high segmentation accuracy and fast running speed on three benchmark datasets. ShelfNet achieves comparable segmentation accuracy to state-of-the-art off-line models with a 4 to 5 times faster inference speed. Our real-time model achieves the highest mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset, while maintaining a high inference speed comparable to BiSeNet. Our offline ShelfNet with ResNet34 backbone outperforms previous models with large backbones such as ResNet101, validating the effectiveness of our shelf-shaped structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) Structure of ShelfNet.(b) S-Block (Shared-weight residual block).</figDesc></figure>
