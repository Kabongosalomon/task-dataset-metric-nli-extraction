<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present CURL: Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning. CURL extracts high-level features from raw pixels using contrastive learning and performs offpolicy control on top of the extracted features. CURL outperforms prior pixel-based methods, both model-based and model-free, on complex tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Games showing 1.9x and 1.2x performance gains at the 100K environment and interaction steps benchmarks respectively. On the DeepMind Control Suite, CURL is the first image-based algorithm to nearly match the sample-efficiency of methods that use state-based features.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Contrastive Unsupervised Representations for</head><p>Reinforcement Learning (CURL) combines instance contrastive learning and reinforcement learning. CURL trains a visual representation encoder by ensuring that the embeddings of data-augmented versions oq and o k of observation o match using a contrastive loss. The query observations oq are treated as the anchor while the key observations o k contain the positive and negatives, all constructed from the minibatch sampled for the RL update. The keys are encoded with a momentum averaged version of the query encoder. The RL policy and (or) value function are built on top of the query encoder which is jointly trained with the contrastive and reinforcement learning objectives. CURL is a generic framework that can be plugged into any RL algorithm that relies on learning representations from high dimensional images. <ref type="bibr">et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, it is widely accepted that learning policies from physical state based features is significantly more sample-efficient than learning from pixels <ref type="bibr">(Tassa et al., 2018)</ref>. In principle, if the state information is present in the pixel data, then we should be able to learn representations that extract the relevant state information. For this reason, it may be possible to learn from pixels as fast as from state given the right representation.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, although high rendering speeds in simulated environments enable RL agents to solve complex tasks within reasonable wall clock time, learning in the real world means that agents are bound to work within the limitations of physics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kalashnikov et al. (2018)</ref> needed a farm of robotic arms that collected large scale robot in-arXiv:2004.04136v4 <ref type="bibr">[cs.</ref>LG] 21 Sep 2020 teraction data over several months to develop their robot grasp value functions and policies. The data-efficiency of the whole pipeline thus has significant room for improvement. Similarly, in simulated worlds which are limited by rendering speeds in the absence of GPU accelerators, data efficiency is extremely crucial to have a fast experimental turnover and iteration. Therefore, improving the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) methods that operate from high dimensional observations is of paramount importance to RL research both in simulation and the real world and allows for faster progress towards the broader goal of developing intelligent autonomous agents.</p><p>A number of approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the sample inefficiency of deep RL algorithms. Broadly, they can be classified into two streams of research, though not mutually exclusive: (i) Auxiliary tasks on the agent's sensory observations; (ii) World models that predict the future. While the former class of methods use auxiliary self-supervision tasks to accelerate the learning progress of model-free RL methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jaderberg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mirowski et al., 2016)</ref>, the latter class of methods build explicit predictive models of the world and use those models to plan through or collect fictitious rollouts for model-free methods to learn from <ref type="bibr">(Sutton, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ha &amp; Schmidhuber, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kaiser et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schrittwieser et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Our work falls into the first class of models, which use auxiliary tasks to improve sample efficiency. Our hypothesis is simple: If an agent learns a useful semantic representation from high dimensional observations, control algorithms built on top of those representations should be significantly more data-efficient. Self-supervised representation learning has seen dramatic progress in the last couple of years with huge advances in masked language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref> and contrastive learning <ref type="bibr">(Hénaff et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">He et al., 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2020)</ref> for language and vision respectively. The representations uncovered by these objectives improve the performance of any supervised learning system especially in scenarios where the amount of labeled data available for the downstream task is really low.</p><p>We take inspiration from the contrastive pre-training successes in computer vision. However, there are a couple of key differences: (i) There is no giant unlabeled dataset of millions of images available beforehand -the dataset is collected online from the agent's interactions and changes dynamically with the agent's experience; (ii) The agent has to perform unsupervised and reinforcement learning simultaneously as opposed to fine-tuning a pre-trained network for a specific downstream task. These two differences introduce a different challenge: How can we use contrastive learning for improving agents that can learn to control effectively and efficiently from online interactions?</p><p>To address this challenge, we propose CURL -Contrastive Uunsupervised Representations for Reinforcement Learning. CURL uses a form of contrastive learning that maximizes agreement between augmented versions of the same observation, where each observation is a stack of temporally sequential frames. We show that CURL significantly improves sample-efficiency over prior pixel-based methods by performing contrastive learning simultaneously with an off-policy RL algorithm. CURL coupled with the Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haarnoja et al., 2018)</ref> results in 1.9x median higher performance over Dreamer, a prior state-of-the-art algorithm on DMControl environments, benchmarked at 100k environment steps and matches the performance of state-based SAC on the majority of 16 environments tested, a first for pixel-based methods. In the Atari setting benchmarked at 100k interaction steps, we show that CURL coupled with a data-efficient version of Rainbow <ref type="bibr">DQN (van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref> results in 1.2x median higher performance over prior methods such as SimPLe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kaiser et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">), improving upon Efficient Rainbow (van Hasselt et al., 2019</ref> on 19 out of 26 Atari games, surpassing human efficiency on two games.</p><p>While contrastive learning in aid of model-free RL has been studied in the past by van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al. (2018)</ref> using Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), the results were mixed with marginal gains in a few DMLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Espeholt et al., 2018)</ref> environments. CURL is the first model to show substantial data-efficiency gains from using a contrastive self-supervised learning objective for model-free RL agents across a multitude of pixel based continuous and discrete control tasks in DMControl and Atari.</p><p>We prioritize designing a simple and easily reproducible pipeline. While the promise of auxiliary tasks and learning world models for RL agents has been demonstrated in prior work, there's an added layer of complexity when introducing components like modeling the future in a latent space <ref type="bibr">(van den Oord et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ha &amp; Schmidhuber, 2018)</ref>. CURL is designed to add minimal overhead in terms of architecture and model learning. The contrastive learning objective in CURL operates with the same latent space and architecture typically used for model-free RL and seamlessly integrates with the training pipeline without the need to introduce multiple additional hyperparameters.</p><p>Our paper makes the following key contributions: We present CURL, a simple framework that integrates contrastive learning with model-free RL with minimal changes to the architecture and training pipeline. Using 16 complex control tasks from the DeepMind control (DMControl) suite and 26 Atari games, we empirically show that contrastive learning combined with model-free RL outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 1.9x on DMControl and 1.2x on Atari compared across leading prior pixel-based methods. CURL is also the first algorithm across both model-based and model-free methods that operates purely from pixels, and nearly matches the performance and sample-efficiency of a SAC algorithm trained from the state based features on the DMControl suite. Finally, our design is simple and does not require any custom architectural choices or hyperparameters which is crucial for reproducible end-to-end training. Through these strong empirical results, we demonstrate that a contrastive objective is the preferred self-supervised auxiliary task for achieving sample-efficiency compared to reconstruction based methods, and enables model-free methods to outperform state-of-the-art model-based methods in terms of data-efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Background</head><p>CURL is a general framework for combining contrastive learning with RL. In principle, one could use any RL algorithm in the CURL pipeline, be it on-policy or off-policy. We use the widely adopted Soft Actor Critic (SAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haarnoja et al., 2018)</ref> for continuous control benchmarks (DM Control) and Rainbow <ref type="bibr">DQN (Hessel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref> for discrete control benchmarks (Atari). Below, we review SAC, Rainbow DQN and Contrastive Learning.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. CURL Architecture: A batch of transitions is sampled from the replay buffer. Observations are then data-augmented twice to form query and key observations, which are then encoded with the query encoder and key encoders, respectively. The queries are passed to the RL algorithm while query-key pairs are passed to the contrastive learning objective. During the gradient update step, only the query encoder is updated. The key encoder weights are the moving average (EMA) of the query weights similar to MoCo (He et al., 2019a).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q = f θ q (o q ) k = f θ k (o k ) o k o q</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Soft Actor Critic</head><p>SAC is an off-policy RL algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy for maximizing the expected trajectory returns. Like other state-of-the-art end-to-end RL algorithms, SAC is effective when solving tasks from state observations but fails to learn efficient policies from pixels. SAC is an actorcritic method that learns a policy π ψ and critics Q φ1 and Q φ2 . The parameters φ i are learned by minimizing the Bellman error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L(φ i , B) = E t∼B (Q φi (o, a) − (r + γ(1 − d)T )) 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where t = (o, a, o , r, d) is a tuple with observation o, action a, reward r and done signal d, B is the replay buffer, and T is the target, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T = min i=1,2 Q * φi (o , a ) − α log π ψ (a |o )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In the target equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref>, Q * φi denotes the exponential moving average (EMA) of the parameters of Q φi . Using the EMA has empirically shown to improve training stability in off-policy RL algorithms. The parameter α is a positive entropy coefficient that determines the priority of the entropy maximization over value function optimization.</p><p>While the critic is given by Q φi , the actor samples actions from policy π ψ and is trained by maximizing the expected return of its actions as in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L(ψ) = E a∼π [Q π (o, a) − α log π ψ (a|o)]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where actions are sampled stochastically from the policy a ψ (o, ξ) ∼ tanh (µ ψ (o) + σ ψ (o) ξ) and ξ ∼ N (0, I) is a standard normalized noise vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Rainbow</head><p>Rainbow <ref type="bibr">DQN (Hessel et al., 2017)</ref> is best summarized as multiple improvements on top of the original Nature DQN <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mnih et al., 2015)</ref> applied together. Specifically, Deep Q Network (DQN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mnih et al., 2015)</ref> combines the off-policy algorithm Q-Learning with a convolutional neural network as the function approximator to map raw pixels to action value functions. Since then, multiple improvements have been proposed such as Double Q Learning <ref type="bibr">(Van Hasselt et al., 2016)</ref>, Dueling Network Architectures <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2015)</ref>, Prioritized Experience Replay <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schaul et al., 2015)</ref>, and Noisy Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fortunato et al., 2017)</ref>. Additionally, distributional reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bellemare et al., 2017)</ref> proposed the technique of predicting a distribution over possible value function bins through the C51 Algorithm. Rainbow DQN combines all of the above techniques into a single off-policy algorithm for state-of-the-art sample efficiency on Atari benchmarks. Additionally, Rainbow also makes use of multi-step returns <ref type="bibr">(Sutton et al., 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">van Hasselt et al. (2019)</ref> propose a data-efficient version of the Rainbow which can be summarized as an improved configuration of hyperparameters that is optimized for performance benchmarked at 100K interaction steps.</p></div>

Given a query q and keys K = {k 0 , k 1 , . . . } and an explicitly known partition of K (with respect to q) P (K) = ({k + }, K \ {k + }), the goal of contrastive learning is to ensure that q matches with k + relatively more than any of the keys in K \ {k + }. q, K, k + , and K \ {k + } are also referred to as anchor, targets, positive, negatives respectively in the parlance of contrastive learning (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">He et al., 2019a)</ref>. Similarities between the anchor and targets are best modeled with dot products (q T k) <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">He et al., 2019a)</ref> or bilinear products (q T W k) (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hénaff et al., 2019)</ref> though other forms like euclidean distances are also common <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schroff et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Gupta, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To learn embeddings that respect these similarity relations, van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CURL Implementation</head><p>CURL minimally modifies a base RL algorithm by training the contrastive objective as an auxiliary loss during the batch update. In our experiments, we train CURL alongside two model-free RL algorithms -SAC for DMControl experiments and Rainbow DQN (data-efficient version) for Atari experiments. To specify a contrastive learning objective, we need to define (i) the discrimination objective (ii) the transformation for generating query-key observations (iii) the embedding procedure for transforming observations into queries and keys and (iv) the inner product used as a similarity measure between the query-key pairs in the contrastive loss. The exact specification these aspects largely determine the quality of the learned representations.</p><p>We first summarize the CURL architecture, and then cover each architectural choice in detail.  <ref type="bibr">, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, instance discrimination is performed across the frame stacks as opposed to single image instances. We use a momentum encoding procedure for targets similar to MoCo (He et al., 2019b) which we found to be better performing for RL. Finally, for the InfoNCE score function, we use a bi-linear inner product similar to CPC (van den Oord et al., 2018) which we found to work better than unit norm vector products used in MoCo and SimCLR. Ablations for both the encoder and the similarity measure choices are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. The contrastive representation is trained jointly with the RL algorithm, and the latent code receives gradients from both the contrastive ob-jective and the Q-function. An overview of the architecture is shown in in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>

Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) based pipelines <ref type="bibr">(Hénaff et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van den Oord et al., 2018)</ref> use groups of image patches separated by a carefully chosen spatial offset for anchors and positives while the negatives come from other patches within the image and from other images.</p><p>While patches are a powerful way to incorporate spatial and instance discrimination together, they introduce extra hyperparameters and architectural design choices which may be hard to adapt for a new problem. SimCLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref> and MoCo (He et al., 2019a) opt for a simpler design where there is no patch extraction.</p><p>Discriminating transformed image instances as opposed to image-patches within the same image optimizes a simpler instance discrimination objective (Wu et al., 2018) with the InfoNCE loss and requires minimal architectural adjustments <ref type="bibr">(He et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. It is preferable to pick a simpler discrimination objective in the RL setting for two reasons. First, considering the brittleness of reinforcement learning algorithms <ref type="bibr">(Henderson et al., 2018)</ref>, complex discrimination may destabilize the RL objective. Second, since RL algorithms are trained on dynamically generated datasets, a complex discrimination objective may significantly increase the wall-clock training time. CURL therefore uses instance discrimination rather than patch discrimination. One could view contrastive instance discrimination setups like SimCLR and MoCo as maximizing mutual information between an image and its augmented version.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Similarity Measure</head><p>Another determining factor in the discrimination objective is the inner product used to measure agreement between query-key pairs. CURL employs the bi-linear inner-product sim(q, k) = q T W k, where W is a learned parameter matrix.

A broader motivation is that while RL algorithms can achieve superhuman performance on Atari games, they are still far less efficient than a human learner. Training for 100-500k environment steps corresponds to a few hours of human time.</p><p>We evaluate (i) sample-efficiency by measuring how many steps it takes the best performing baselines to match CURL performance at a fixed T (100k or 500k) steps and (ii) performance by measuring the ratio of the episode returns achieved by CURL versus the best performing baseline at T steps. To be explicit, when we say data or sample-efficiency we're referring to (i) and when we say performance we're referring to (ii).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Environments</head><p>Our primary goal for CURL is sample-efficient control from pixels that is broadly applicable across a range of environments. We benchmark the performance of CURL for both discrete and continuous control environments. Specifically, we focus on DMControl suite for continuous control tasks and the Atari Games benchmark for discrete control tasks with inputs being raw pixels rendered by the environments.</p><p>DeepMind Control: Recently, there have been a number of papers that have benchmarked for sample efficiency on challenging visual continuous control tasks belonging to the DMControl suite <ref type="bibr">(Tassa et al., 2018)</ref> where the agent operates purely from pixels. The reason for operating in these environments is multi fold: (i) they present a reasonably challenging and diverse set of tasks; (ii) sample-efficiency of pure model-free RL algorithms operating from pixels on these benchmarks is poor; (iii) multiple recent efforts to improve the sample efficiency of both model-free and model-based methods on these benchmarks thereby giving us sufficient baselines to compare against; (iv) performance on the DM control suite is relevant to robot learning in real world benchmarks.</p><p>We run experiments on sixteen environments from DM-Control to examine the performance of CURL on pixels relative to SAC with access to the ground truth state, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. For more extensive benchmarking, we compare CURL to five leading pixel-based methods across the the six environments presented in Yarats et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2019)</ref>: ball-incup, finger-spin, reacher-easy, cheetah-run, walker-walk, cartpole-swingup for benchmarking.</p><p>Atari: Similar to DMControl sample-efficiency benchmarks, there have been a number of recent papers that have benchmarked for sample-efficiency on the Atari 2600 Games. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kaiser et al. (2019)</ref> proposed comparing various algorithms in terms of performance achieved within 100K timesteps (400K frames, frame skip of 4) of interaction with the environments (games). The method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kaiser et al. (2019)</ref> called SimPLe is a model-based RL algorithm.</p><p>SimPLe is compared to a random agent, model-free Rainbow <ref type="bibr">DQN (Hessel et al., 2017)</ref> and human performance for the same amount of interaction time. <ref type="bibr">Recently, van Hasselt et al.

Given that the same benchmark has been established in multiple recent papers and that there is a human baseline to compare to, we benchmark CURL on all the 26 Atari Games <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haarnoja et al., 2018)</ref>. These baselines are competitive methods for benchmarking control from pixels. In addition to these, we also present the baseline State-SAC where the assumption is that the agent has access to low level state based features and does not operate from pixels. This baseline acts as an oracle in that it approximates the upper bound of how sample-efficient a pixel-based agent can get in these environments.</p><p>Atari baselines: For benchmarking performance on Atari, we compare CURL to (i) SimPLe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kaiser et al., 2019)</ref>, the top performing model-based method in terms of dataefficiency on Atari and (ii) Rainbow DQN (Hessel et al., 2017), a top-performing model-free baseline for Atari, (iii) OTRainbow <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kielak, 2020)</ref> which is an OverTrained version of Rainbow for data-efficiency, (iv) Efficient Rainbow <ref type="bibr">(van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref> which is a modification of Rainbow hyperparameters for data-efficiency, (v) Random Agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kaiser et al., 2019)</ref>, (vi) Human Performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kaiser et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref>. All the baselines and our method are evaluated for performance after 100K interaction steps (400K frames with a frame skip of 4) which corresponds to roughly two hours of gameplay.

CURL is the first model-free RL pipeline accelerated by contrastive learning with minimal architectural changes to demonstrate state-ofthe-art performance on complex tasks so far dominated by approaches that have relied on learning world models and (or) decoder-based objectives. We hope that progress like CURL enables avenues for real-world deployment of RL in areas like robotics where data-efficiency is paramount. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Implementation Details</head><p>Below, we explain the implementation details for CURL in the DMControl setting. Specifically, we use the SAC algorithm as the RL objective coupled with CURL and build on top of the publicly released implementation from <ref type="bibr">Yarats et al. (2019)</ref>. We present in detail the hyperparameters for the architecture and optimization. We do not use any extra hyperparameter for balancing the contrastive loss and the reinforcement learning losses. Both the objectives are weighed equally in the gradient updates. Architecture: We use an encoder architecture that is similar to <ref type="bibr">(Yarats et al., 2019)</ref>, which we sketch in PyTorch-like pseuodocode below. The actor and critic both use the same encoder to embed image observations. A full list of hyperparameters is displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>For contrastive learning, CURL utilizes momentum for the key encoder <ref type="figure">(He et al., 2019b)</ref> and a bi-linear inner product as the similarity measure (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2018)</ref>. Performance curves ablating these two architectural choices are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. Terminology: A common point of confusion is the meaning "training steps." We use the term environment steps to denote the amount of times the simulator environment is stepped through and interaction steps to denote the number of times the agent steps through its policy. The terms action repeat or frame skip refer to the number of times an action is repeated when it's drawn from the agent's policy. For example, if action repeat is set to 4, then 100k interaction steps is equivalent to 400k environment steps.</p><p>Batch Updates: After initializing the replay buffer with observations extracted by a random agent, we sample a batch of observations, compute the CURL objectives, and step through the optimizer. Note that since queries and keys are generated by data-augmenting an observation, we can generate arbitrarily many keys to increase the contrastive batch size without sampling any additional observations.</p><p>Shared Representations: The objective of performing contrastive learning together with RL is to ensure that the shared encoder learns rich features that facilitate sample efficient control. There is a subtle coincidental connection between MoCo and off-policy RL. Both the frameworks adopt the usage of a momentum averaged (EMA) version of the underlying model. In MoCo, the EMA encoder is used for encoding the keys (targets) while in off-policy RL, the EMA version of the Q-networks are used as targets in the Bellman error <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mnih et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haarnoja et al., 2018)</ref>. Thanks to this connection, CURL shares the convolutional encoder, momentum coefficient and EMA update between contrastive and reinforcement learning updates for the shared parameters. The MLP part of the critic that operates on top of these convolutional features has a separate momentum coefficient and update decoupled from the image encoder parameters.</p><p>Balancing Contrastive and RL Updates: While past work has learned hyperparameters to balance the auxiliary loss coefficient or learning rate relative to the RL objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jaderberg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yarats et al., 2019)</ref>, CURL does not need any such adjustments. We use both the contrastive and RL objectives together with equal weight and learning rate. This simplifies the training process compared to other methods, such as training a VAE jointly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hafner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lee et al., 2019)</ref>, that require careful tuning of coefficients for representation learning.</p><p>Differences in Data Collection between Computer Vision and RL Settings: There are two key differences between contrastive learning in the computer vision and RL settings because of their different goals. Unsupervised feature learning methods built for downstream vision tasks like image classification assume a setting where there is a large static dataset of unlabeled images. On the other hand, in RL, the dataset changes over time to account for the agent's new experiences. Secondly, the size of the memory bank of labeled images and dataset of unlabeled ones in vision-based settings are 65K and 1M (or 1B) respectively. The goal in vision-based methods is to learn from millions of unlabeled images. On the other hand, the goal in CURL is to develop sample-efficient RL algorithms. For example, to be able to solve a task within 100K timesteps (approximately 2 hours in real-time), an agent can only ingest 100K image frames.</p><p>Therefore, unlike MoCo, CURL does not use a memory bank for contrastive learning. Instead, the negatives are constructed on the fly for every minibatch sampled from the agent's replay buffer for an RL update similar to SimCLR. The exact implementation is provided as a PyTorch-like code snippet in 4.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Augmentation:</head><p>Random crop data augmentation has been crucial for the performance of deep learning based computer vision systems in object recognition, detection and segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Krizhevsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Szegedy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cubuk et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. However, similar augmentation methods have not seen much adoption in the field of RL even though several benchmarks use raw pixels as inputs to the model.</p><p>CURL adopts the random crop data augmentation as the stochastic data augmentation applied to a frame stack. To make it easier for the model to correlate spatio-temporal patterns in the input, we apply the same random crop (in terms of box coordinates) across all four frames in the stack as opposed to extracting different random crop positions from each frame in the stack. Further, unlike in computer vision systems where the aspect ratio for random crop is allowed to be as low as 0.08, we preserve much of the spatial information as possible and use a constant aspect ratio of 0.84 between the original and cropped. In our experiments, data augmented samples for CURL are formed by cropping 84 × 84 frames from an input frame of 100 × 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DMControl:</head><p>We render observations at 100 × 100 and randomly crop 84 × 84 frames. For evaluation, we render observations at 100 × 100 and center crop to 84 × 84 pixels. We found that implementing random crop efficiently was extremely important to the success of the algorithm. We provide pseudocode below:</p><p>from skimage import view_as_windows import numpy as np def random_crop(imgs, out): """ Vectorized random crop args: imgs: shape (B,C,H,W) out: output size (e.g. 84) """ # n: batch size. n = imgs.shape[0] img_size = imgs.shape[-1] # e.g. 100 crop_max = img_size -out imgs = np.transpose(imgs, (0, 2, 3, 1)) w1 = np.random.randint(0, crop_max, n) h1 = np.random.randint(0, crop_max, n) # creates all sliding window # combinations of size (out) windows = view_as_windows( imgs, (1, out, out, 1))[..., 0,:,:, 0] # selects a random window # for each batch element cropped = windows[np.arange(n), w1, h1] return cropped</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Atari100k Implementation Details</head><p>The flexibility of CURL allows us to apply it to discrete control setting with minimal modifications. Similar to our rationale for picking SAC as the baseline RL algorithm to couple CURL with (for continuous control), we pick the data-efficient version of Rainbow DQN (Efficient Rainbow) <ref type="bibr">(van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref> for Atari100K which performs competitively with an older version of SimPLe (most recent version has improved numbers). In order to understand specifically what the gains from CURL are without any other changes, we adopt the exact same hyperparameters specified in the paper <ref type="bibr">(van Hasselt et al., 2019)</ref> (including a modified convolutional encoder that uses larger kernel size and stride of 5). We present the details in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>. Similar to DMControl, the contrastive objective and the RL objective are weighted equally for learning (except for Pong, Freeway, Boxing and PrivateEye for which we used a coefficient of 0.05 for the momentum contastive loss. On a large majority (22 out of 26) of the games, we do not use this adjustment. While it is standard practice to use the same hyperparameters for all games in Atari, papers proposing auxiliary losses have adopted a different practice of using game specific coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jaderberg et al., 2016)</ref>.). We use the Efficient Rainbow codebase from https: //github.com/Kaixhin/Rainbow which has a reproduced version of <ref type="bibr">van Hasselt et al. (2019)</ref>. We evaluate with 20 random seeds and report the mean score for each game given the high variance nature of the Atari100k steps benchmark. We restrict ourselves to using grayscale renderings of image observations and use random crop of frame stack as data augmentation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Further Investigation of Data-Efficiency in Contrastive RL</head><p>To further benchmark CURL's sample-efficiency, we compare it to state-based SAC on a total of 16 DMControl environments.

The number of steps it takes a prior leading pixel-based method, Dreamer, to achieve the same score that CURL achieves at 100k training steps (clipped at 1M steps). On average, CURL is 4.5x more data-efficient. We chose Dreamer because the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hafner et al., 2019)</ref> report performance for all of the above environments while other baselines like SLAC and SAC+AE only benchmark on 4 and 6 environments, respectively. For further comparison of CURL with these methods, the reader is referred to Encoding each frame indiviudally ensures that the contrastive objective only has access to visual discriminants.</p><p>Comparing the visual and spatiotemporal variants of CURL in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows that the variant trained on stacked frames outperforms the visual-only version in most environments. The only exceptions are reacher and ball-in-cup environments. Indeed, in those environments the visual signal is strong enough to solve the task optimally, whereas in other environments, such as walker and cheetah, where balance or coordination is required, visual information alone is insufficient.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.2. Increasing Gradient Updates per Agent Step</head><p>Although most baselines we benchmark against use one gradient update per agent step, it was recently empirically shown that increasing the ratio of gradients per step improves data-efficiency in RL <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kielak, 2020)</ref>. This finding is also supported by SLAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lee et al., 2019)</ref>, where results are shown with a ratio of 1:1 (SLACv1) and 3:1 (SLACv2). We  <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. CURL with temporal and visual discrimination (red) compared to CURL with only visual discrimination (green). In most settings, the variant with temporal variant outperforms the purely visual variant of CURL. The two exceptions are reacher and ball in cup environments, suggesting that learning dynamics is not necessary for those two environments. Note that the walker environment was run with action repeat of 4, whereas walker walk in the main results <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> was run with action repeat of 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.3. Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning</head><p>Typically, Deep RL representations depend almost entirely on the reward function specific to a task. However, handcrafted representations such as the proprioceptive state are independent of the reward function. It is much more desirable to learn reward-agnostic representations, so that the same representation can be re-used across different RL tasks. We test whether CURL can learn such representations by comparing CURL to a variant where the critic gradients are backpropagated through the critic and contrastive dense feedforward networks but stopped before reaching the convolutional neural network (CNN) part of the encoder.</p><p>Scores displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> show that for many environments, the detached CNN representations are sufficient to learn an optimal policy. The major exception is the cheetah environment, where the detached representation significantly under-performs. Though promising, we leave further exploration of task-agnostic representations for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.4. Removing Data Augmentation for the Actor Critic</head><p>Our main results involve the use of data augmentations to regularize both the contrastive and SAC objectives. Here, we investigate whether the contrastive representations alone are sufficient for learning effective policies. In these experiments, we only augment the data for the contrastive  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. CURL where the CNN part of the encoder receives gradients from both the contrastive loss and critic (red) compared to CURL with the convolutional part of the encoder trained only with the contrastive objective (green). The detached encoder variant is able to learn representations that enable near-optimal learning on most environments, except for cheetah. As in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, the walker environment was run with action repeat of 4.</p><p>objective but not for the SAC agent. As a result, data augmentation is used only to learn features but does not influence the control policy. The pseudocode is shown below: . CURL with no data augmentations passed to the SAC agent improves the performance of the baseline pixel SAC by a mean of 2.0x / median of 1.7x on DMControl500k. For these runs we use a smaller batch size of 128 than the 512 batch size used for results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>. While the constastive loss alone improves over the pixel SAC baseline, most environments benefit from data augmentation also being passed to the SAC agent.</p><p>DMControl500k results plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> show that, on average, features learned through the contrastive loss alone improve the pixel SAC baseline by 2x. Augmenting the input passed to the SAC algorithm further improves performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.5. Predicting State from Pixels</head><p>Despite improved sample-efficiency on most DMControl tasks, there is still a visible gap between the performance of SAC on state and SAC with CURL in some environments. Since CURL learns representations by performing instance discrimination across stacks of three frames, it's possible that the reason for degraded sample-efficiency on more challenging tasks is due to partial-observability of the ground truth state.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we perform supervised regression (X, Y ) from pixels X to the proprioceptive state Y , where each data point x ∈ X is a stack of three consecutive frames and y ∈ Y is the corresponding state extracted from the simulator. We find that the error in predicting the state from pixels correlates with the policy performance of pixelbased methods. Test-time error rates displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure  11</ref> show that environments that CURL solves as efficiently as state-based SAC have low error-rates in predicting the state from stacks of pixels. The prediction error increases for more challenging environments, such as cheetah-run and walker-walk. Finally, the error is highest for environments where current pixel-based methods, CURL included, make no progress at all <ref type="bibr">(Tassa et al., 2018)</ref>, such as humanoid and swimmer.</p><p>This investigation suggests that degraded policy performance on challenging tasks may result from the lack of requisite information about the underlying state in the pixel data used for learning representations. We leave further investigation for future work.</p></div>

In DMControl, environments fall into two groups -where the state corresponds to either (a) positions and velocities of the robot joints or (b) the joint angles and angular velocities.</p><p>v2 Minor changes to DMControl to account for frame skip factor when evaluating data-efficiency of CURL and baselines. Changed action repeat for the Walker-walk task from 4 to 2 to match baseline implementations.</p><p>v3 ICML 2020 Camera Ready. For our Atari experiments, we moved to the https://github.com/Kaixhin/ Rainbow codebase for easy and clean benchmarking that directly builds on top of Efficient Rainbow without other changes. We also run 20 seeds as opposed to 3 seeds earlier given the high variance nature of the benchmark.</p><p>v4 Added in Section E.4 -an ablation investigating whether contrastive representations alone, with no augmentations passed to the policy during training, improve the baseline SAC policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Connection to work on data augmentations</head><p>Recently, there have been two papers published on using data augmentations for reinforcement learning, RAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Laskin et al., 2020)</ref> and DrQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kostrikov et al., 2020)</ref>. These two papers present the version of CURL without an auxiliary contrastive loss but rather directly feeding in the augmented views of the image observations to the underlying value / policy network(s). Both RAD and DrQ present results on both continuous and discrete control environments, surpassing the results presented in CURL on both the DMControl and Atari benchmarks. Plenty of researchers have opined in public forums whether the results in RAD and DrQ make CURL irrelevant if the objective is to use data augmentations for data-efficient reinforcement learning. We believe that answering this question needs more nuance and present our opinions below:</p><p>1. If one has access to a rich stream of rewards from the underlying environment and is interested in optimzing the performance in terms of average reward, RAD and DrQ are likely to work better than CURL. The reason for this is simply that RAD and DrQ directly optimize for the objective one cares about, while CURL introduces an additional auxiliary consistency objective.</p><p>2. If one does not have access to a rich stream of rewards and is interested in learning good latent spaces in a task agnostic manner that can allow for data-efficient controllers across multiple tasks, CURL is the only option since the contrastive objective in CURL is reward independent. Our ablation on the detached encoder with the CURL objective present evidence that one could build simple MLPs on top of the CURL features without fine-tuning the underlying encoder and still be data-efficient on many of the DMControl tasks.</p><p>3. Future work in data-efficient reinforcement learning, particularly for real world settings, is likely to require approaches that do not rely on reward functions. In such scenarios, CURL is likely to be the more preferred approach. Further, one could potentially use CURL in a scenario where unsupervised pre-training without reward functions is initially performed before fine-tuning to the RL objective across multiple tasks.</p><p>Given the above reasons, there isn't a straightforward answer as to which is the better algorithm and the answer really depends on what the researcher / practioner wants to solve. We also emphasize that CURL was the first approach that used data augmentations effectively to significantly improve the data-efficiency of model-free reinforcement learning methods with very simple changes and showed improvement over relatively more complex model-based methods. The augmentations and results in CURL inspired future work in the form of RAD and DrQ. We hope that the analysis and results presented in CURL encourage researchers to employ data augmentations, contrastive losses and unsupervised pre-training for future reinforcement learning research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>CURL uses instance discrimination with similarities to Sim-CLR<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>, MoCo (He et al., 2019a) and CPC (Hénaff et al., 2019).
