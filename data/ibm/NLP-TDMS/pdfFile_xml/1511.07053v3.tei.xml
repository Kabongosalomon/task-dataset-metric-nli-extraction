<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a structured prediction architecture, which exploits the local generic features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks and the capacity of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to retrieve distant dependencies. The proposed architecture, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for image classification. We modify and extend it to perform the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. Each ReNet layer is composed of four RNN that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, encoding patches or activations, and providing relevant global information. Moreover, ReNet layers are stacked on top of pre-trained convolutional layers, benefiting from generic local features. Upsampling layers follow ReNet layers to recover the original image resolution in the final predictions. The proposed ReSeg architecture is efficient, flexible and suitable for a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on several widely-used semantic segmentation datasets: Weizmann Horse, Oxford Flower, and CamVid; achieving stateof-the-art performance. Results show that ReSeg can act as a suitable architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, and may have further applications in other structured prediction problems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become the de facto standard in many computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15]</ref>. Top performing image classification architectures usually involve very deep CNN trained in a supervised fashion on a large datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref> and have been shown to produce generic hierarchical visual representations that perform well on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, these deep CNNs heavily reduce the input resolution through successive applications of pooling or subsampling layers. While these layers seem to contribute significantly to the desirable invariance properties of deep CNNs, they also make it challenging to use these pre-trained CNNs for tasks such as semantic segmentation, where a per pixel prediction is required.</p><p>Recent advances in semantic segmentation tend to convert the standard deep CNN classifier into Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref>] to obtain coarse image representations, which are subsequently upsampled to recover the lost resolution. However, these methods are not designed to take into account and preserve both local and global contextual dependencies, which has shown to be useful for semantic segmentation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>. These models often employ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as a post-processing step to locally smooth the model predictions, however the long-range contextual dependencies remain relatively unexploited.</p><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been introduced in the literature to retrieve global spatial dependencies and further improve semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>. However, training spatially recurrent neural networks tends to be computationally intensive.</p><p>In this paper, we aim at the efficient application of Recurrent Neural Networks RNN to retrieve contextual information from images. We propose to extend the ReNet architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, originally designed for image classification, to deal with the more ambitious task of semantic segmentation. ReNet layers can efficiently capture contextual dependencies from images by first sweeping the image horizontally, and then sweeping the output of hidden states vertically. The output of a ReNet layer is therefore implicitly encoding the local features at each pixel position with respect to the whole input image, providing relevant global information. Moreover, in order to fully exploit local and global pixel dependencies, we stack the ReNet layers on top of the output of a FCN, i.e. the intermediate convolutional output of VGG-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>, to benefit from generic local features. We validate our method on Weizmann Horse and Oxford Flower foreground/background segmentation datasets as a proof of concept for the proposed architecture. Then, we evaluate the performance in the standard benchmark of urban scenes CamVid; achieving state-of-the-art in all three datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Methods based on FCN tackle the information recovery (upsampling) problem in a large variety of ways. For instance, Eigen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> introduce a multi-scale architecture, which extracts coarse predictions, which are then refined using finer scales. Farabet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> introduce a multi-scale CNN architecture; Hariharan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> combine the information distributed over all layers to make accurate predictions. Other methods such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> use simple bilinear interpolation to upsample the feature maps of increasingly abstract layers. More sophisticated upsampling methods, such as unpooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33]</ref> or deconvolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>, are introduced in the literature. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> concatenate the feature maps of the downsampling layers with the feature maps of the upsampling layers to help recover finer information.</p><p>RNN and RNN-like models have become increasingly popular in the semantic segmentation literature to capture long distance pixel dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41]</ref>. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>, CNN are unrolled through different time steps to include semantic feedback connections. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, 2-dimensional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which consist of 4 LSTM blocks scanning all directions of an image (left-bottom, left-top, right-top, right-bottom), are introduced to learn long range spatial dependencies. Following a similar direction, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, multi-dimensional LSTM are swept along different image directions; however, in this case, computations are re-arranged in a pyramidal fashion for efficiency reasons. Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, ReNet is proposed to model pixel dependencies in the context of image classification. It is worth noting that one important consequence of the adoption of the ReNet spatial sequences is that they are even more easily parallelizable, as each RNN is dependent only along a horizontal or vertical sequence of pixels; i.e., all rows/columns of pixels can be processed at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model Description</head><p>The proposed ReSeg model builds on top of ReNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> and extends it to address the task of semantic segmentation. The model pipeline involves multiple stages.</p><p>First, the input image is processed with the first layers of VGG-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> network, pre-trained on ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref> and not fine-tuned, and is set such that the image resolution does not become too small. The resulting feature maps are then fed into one or more ReNet layers that sweep over the image. Finally, one or more upsampling layers are employed to resize the last feature maps to the same resolution as the input and a softmax non-linearity is applied to predict the probability distribution over the classes for each pixel.</p><p>The recurrent layer is the core of our architecture and is composed by multiple RNN that can be implemented as a vanilla tanh RNN layer, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref> or a LSTM layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>. Previous work has shown that the ReNet model can perform well with little concern for the specific recurrent unit used, therefore, we have chosen to use GRU units as they strike a good balance between memory usage and computational power.</p><p>In the following section we will define the recurrent and the upsampling layers in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Recurrent layer</head><p>As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, each recurrent layer is composed by 4 RNNs coupled together in such a way to capture the local and global spatial structure of the input data.</p><p>Specifically, we take as an input an image (or the feature map of the previous layer) X of elements x ∈ R H×W ×C , where H, W and C are respectively the height, width and number of channels (or features) and we split it into I × J patches p i,j ∈ R Hp×Wp×C . We then sweep vertically a first time with two RNNs f ↓ and f ↑ , with U recurrent units each, that move top-down and bottom-up respectively. Note that the processing of each column is independent and can be done in parallel. At every time step each RNN reads the next nonoverlapping patch p i,j and, based on its previous state, emits a projection o i,j and updates its state z i,j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">o ↓ i,j = f ↓ (z ↓ i−1,j , p i,j ), for i = 1, · · · , I (1) o ↑ i,j = f ↑ (z ↑ i+1,j , p i,j ), for i = I, · · · , 1<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We stress that the decision to read non-overlapping patches is a modeling choice to increase the image scan speed and lower the memory usage, but is not a limitation of the architecture.</p><p>Once the first two vertical RNNs have processed the whole input X, we concatenate their projections o ↓ i,j and o ↑ i,j to obtain a composite feature map O whose elements o i,j ∈ R 2U can be seen as the activation of a feature detector at the location (i, j) with respect to all the patches in the j-th column of the input. We denote what we described so far as the vertical recurrent sublayer.</p><p>After obtaining the concatenated feature map O , we sweep over each of its rows with a pair of new RNNs, f → and f ← . We chose not to split O into patches so that the second recurrent sublayer has the same granularity as the first one, but this is not a constraint of the model and different architectures can be explored. With a similar but specular procedure as the one described before, we proceed reading one element o i,j at each step, to obtain a concate-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">nated feature map O ↔ = h ↔ i,j j=1...J i=1...I , once again with o ↔ i,j ∈ R 2U .</formula><p>Each element o ↔ i,j of this horizontal recurrent sublayer represents the features of one of the input image patches p i,j with contextual information from the whole image.</p><p>It is trivial to note that it is possible to concatenate many recurrent layers O (1···L) one after the other and train them with any optimization algorithm that performs gradient descent, as the composite model is a smooth, continuous function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Upsampling layer</head><p>Since by design each recurrent layer processes nonoverlapping patches, the size of the last composite feature map will be smaller than the size of the initial input X, whenever the patch size is greater than one. To be able to compute a segmentation mask at the same resolution as the ground truth, the prediction should be expanded back before applying the softmax non-linearity.</p><p>Several different methods can be used to this end, e.g., fully connected layers, full convolutions and transposed convolutions. The first is not a good candidate in this domain as it does not take into account the topology of the input, which is essential for this task; the second is not optimal either, as it would require large kernels and stride sizes to upsample by the required factor. Transposed convolutions are both memory and computation efficient, and are the ideal method to tackle this problem.</p><p>Transposed convolutions -also known as fractionally strided convolutions -have been employed in many works in recent literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>. This method is based on the observation that direct convolutions can be expressed as a dot product between the flattened input and a sparse matrix, whose non-zero elements are elements of the convolutional kernel. The equivalence with the convolution is granted by the connectivity pattern defined by the matrix.</p><p>Transposed convolutions apply the transpose of this transformation matrix to the input, resulting in an operation whose input and output shapes are inverted with respect to the original direct convolution. A very efficient implementation of this operation can be obtained exploiting the gradient operation of the convolution -whose optimized implementation can be found in many of the most popular libraries for neural networks. For an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of each alternative, we refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Datasets</head><p>We evaluated the proposed ReSeg architecture on several benchmark datasets. We proceeded by first assessing the performances of the model on the Weizmann Horse and the Oxford Flowers datasets and then focused on the more challenging Camvid dataset. We will describe each dataset in detail in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Weizmann Horse</head><p>The Weizmann Horse dataset, introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, is an image segmentation dataset consisting of 329 variable size images in both RGB and gray scale format, matched with an equal number of groundtruth segmentation images, of the same size as the corresponding image. The groundtruth segmentations contain a foreground/background mask of the focused horse, encoded as a real-value between 0 and 255. To convert this into a boolean mask, we threshold in the center of the range setting all smaller values to 0, and all greater values to 1.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The ReSeg network. For space reasons we do not represent the pretrained VGG-16 convolutional layers that we use to preprocess the input to ReSeg. The first 2 RNNs (blue and green) are applied on 2x2x3 patches of the image, their 16x16x256 feature maps are concatenated and fed as input to the next two RNNs (red and yellow) which read 1x1x512 patches and emit the output of the first ReNet layer. Two similar ReNet layers are stacked, followed by an upsampling layer and a softmax nonlinearity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Oxford Flowers 17</head><p>The Oxford Flowers 17 class dataset from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> contains 1363 variable size RGB images, with 848 image segmentations maps associated with a subset of the RGB images. There are 8 unique segmentation classes defined over all maps, including flower, sky, and grass. To build a foreground/background mask, we take the original segmentation maps, and set any pixel not belonging to class 38 (flower class) to 0, and setting the flower class pixels to 1. This binary segmentation task for Oxford Flowers 17 is further described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">CamVid Dataset</head><p>The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> is a real-world dataset which consists of images recorded from a car with an internally mounted camera, capturing frames of 960 × 720 RGB pixels per frame, with a recording frame rate of 30 frames per second. A total of ten minutes of video was recorded, and approximately one frame per second has been manually annotated with per pixel class labels, from one of 32 possible classes. A small number of pixels were labelled as void in the original dataset. These do not belong to any of the 32 classes prescribed in the original data, and are ignored during evaluation. We used the same subset of 11 class categories as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for experimental analysis. The CamVid dataset itself is split into 367 training, 101 validation and 233 test images, and in order to make our experimental setup fully comparable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we downsampled all the images by a factor of 2 resulting in a final 480 × 360 resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Experimental settings</head><p>To gain confidence with the sensitivity of the model to the different hyperparameters, we decided to evaluate it first on the Weissman Horse and Oxford Flowers datasets on a binary segmentation task; we then focused the most of our efforts on the more challenging semantic segmentation task on the CamVid dataset.</p><p>The number of hyperparameters of this model is potentially very high, as for each ReNet layer different implementations are possible (namely vanilla RNN, GRU or LSTM), each one with its specific parameters. Furthermore, the number of features, the size of the patches and the initialization scheme have to be defined for each ReNet layer as well as for each transposed convolutional layer. To make it feasible to explore the hyperparameter space, some of the hyperparameters have been fixed by design and the remaining have been finetuned. In the rest of this section, the architectural choices for both sets of parameters will be detailed.</p><p>All the transposed convolution upsampling layers were followed by a ReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> non-linearity and initialized with the fan-in plus fan-out initialization scheme described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>. The recurrent weight matrices were instead initialized to be orthonormal, following the procedure defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>. We also constrained the stride of the upsampling transposed convolutional layers to be tied to their filter size.</p><p>In the segmentation task, each training image carries classification information for all of its pixels. Differently from the image classification task, small batch sizes provide the model with a good amount of information with sufficient variance to learn and generalize well. We experimented with various batch sizes going as low as processing a single image at the time, obtaining comparable results in terms of performance. In our experiments we kept a fixed batch size of 5, as a compromise between train speed and memory usage. In all our experiments, we used L2 regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, also known as weight decay, set to 0.001 to avoid instability at the end of training. We trained all our models with the Adadelta <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> optimization algorithm, for its desired property of not requiring a specific hyperparameter tuning. The effect of Batch Normalization in RNNs has been a focus of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>, but it does not seem to provide a reliable improvement in performance, so we decided not to adopt it.</p><p>In the experiments, we varied the number of ReNet layers and the number of upsampling transposed convolutional layers, each of them defined respectively by the number of features d RE (l) and d UP (l), the size of the input patches (or  equivalently of the filters) ps RE (l) and f s UP (l).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Results</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we report the results on the Weizmann Horse dataset. On this dataset, we verified the assumption that processing the input image with some pre-trained convolutional layers from VGG-16 could ease the learning. Specifically, we restricted ourselves to only using the first 7 convolutional layers from VGG, as we only intended to extract some low-level generic features and learn the task-specific high-level features with the ReNet layers. The results indeed show an increase in terms of average Intersection over Union (IoU) when these layers are being used, confirming our hypothesis. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results for Oxford Flowers dataset, when using the full ReSeg architecture (i.e., including VGG convolutional layers). As shown in the table, our method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art both in terms of global accuracy and average IoU.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, boosts the original model performance, as expected. Therefore, introducing sub-model averaging to ReSeg would also presum-ably result in significant performance increase. However, this remains to be tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>As reported in the previous section, our experiments on the Weizmann Horse dataset show that processing the input images with some layers of VGG-16 pre-trained network improves the results. In this setting, pre-processing the input with Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) does not seem to give any advantage (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>). We did not use any other kind of pre-processing.</p><p>While on both the Weizmann Horse and the Oxford Flowers datasets we trained on a binary background/foreground segmentation task, on CamVid we addressed the full semantic segmentation task. In this setting, when the dataset is highly imbalanced, the segmentation performance of some classes can drop significantly as the network tries to maximize the score on the highoccurrence classes, de facto ignoring the low-occurrence ones. To overcome this behaviour, we added a term to the cross-entropy loss to bias the prediction towards the low-occurrence classes. We use median frequency balancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>, which re-weights the class predictions by the ratio between the median of the frequencies of the classes (computed on the training set) and the frequency of each class. This increases the score of the low frequency classes (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>) at the price of a more noisy segmentation mask, as the probability of the underrepresented classes is overestimated and can lead to an increase in misclassified pixels in the output segmentation mask, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>On all datasets we report the per-pixel accuracy (Global acc), computed as the percentage of true positives w.r.t. the total number of pixels in the image, and the average perclass Intersection over Union (Avg IoU), computed on each class as true positive divided by the sum of true positives, false positives and false negatives and then averaged. In the full semantic segmentation setting we also report the per-class accuracy and the average per-class accuracy (Avg class acc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced the ReSeg model, an extension of the ReNet model for image semantic segmentation. The proposed architecture shows state-of-the-art performances on CamVid, a widely used dataset for urban scene semantic segmentation, as well as on the much smaller Oxford Flowers dataset. We also report state-of-the-art performances on the Weizmann Horses.</p><p>In our analysis, we discuss the effects of applying some layers of VGG-16 to process the input data, as well as those of introducing a class balancing term in the cross-entropy loss function to help the learning of under-represented classes. Notably, it is sufficient to process the input images with just a few layers of VGG-16 for the ReSeg model to gracefully handle the semantic segmentation task, confirming its ability to encode contextual information and long term dependencies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A ReNet layer. The blue and green dots on the input image/feature map represent the steps of f ↓ and f ↑ respectively. On the concatenation of the resulting feature maps, f → (yellow dots) and f ← (red dots) are subsequently swept. Their feature maps are finally concatenated to form the output of the ReNet layer, depicted as a blue heatmap in thefigure.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>CamVid. The table reports the per-class accuracy, the average per-class accuracy, the global accuracy and the average intersection over union. The best values and the values within 1 point from the best are highlighted in bold for each column. For completeness we report the Bayesian Segnet models even if they are not directly comparable to the others as they perform a form of model averaging.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Method</cell><cell cols="3">Global acc Avg IoU</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">All foreground baseline</cell><cell>25.4</cell><cell></cell><cell>79.9</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Method</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="5">Global acc Avg IoU</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">All background baseline</cell><cell>74.7</cell><cell></cell><cell>0.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="5">All background baseline</cell><cell cols="2">71.0</cell><cell></cell><cell>0.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Kernelized structural SVM [5]</cell><cell>94.6</cell><cell></cell><cell>80.1</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="5">All foreground baseline</cell><cell cols="2">29.0</cell><cell></cell><cell>29.2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ReSeg (no VGG)</cell><cell>94.9</cell><cell></cell><cell>79.9</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="4">GrabCut [37]</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">95.9</cell><cell></cell><cell>89.3</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CRF learning [29]</cell><cell>95.7</cell><cell></cell><cell>84.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="4">Tri-map [46]</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">96.7</cell><cell></cell><cell>91.7</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">PatchCut [48]</cell><cell>95.8</cell><cell></cell><cell>84.0</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>ReSeg</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>98</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>93.7</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ReSeg</cell><cell>96.8</cell><cell></cell><cell>91.6</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="11">Table 2.
