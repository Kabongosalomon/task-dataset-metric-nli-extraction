				<p>A good neural sequence-to-sequence summa-rization model should have a strong encoder that can distill and memorize the important information from long input texts so that the de-coder can generate salient summaries based on the encoder&apos;s memory. In this paper, we aim to improve the memorization capabilities of the encoder of a pointer-generator model by adding an additional &apos;closed-book&apos; decoder without attention and pointer mechanisms. Such a decoder forces the encoder to be more selective in the information encoded in its memory state because the decoder can&apos;t rely on the extra information provided by the attention and possibly copy modules, and hence improves the entire model. On the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, our 2-decoder model outperforms the baseline significantly in terms of ROUGE and METEOR metrics, for both cross-entropy and reinforced setups (and on human evaluation). Moreover, our model also achieves higher scores in a test-only DUC-2002 generalizability setup. We further present a memory ability test, two saliency metrics, as well as several sanity-check ab-lations (based on fixed-encoder, gradient-flow cut, and model capacity) to prove that the en-coder of our 2-decoder model does in fact learn stronger memory representations than the baseline encoder.</p>

The summary generated by our 2-decoder model also recovers most of the information mentioned in the reference summary (highlighted in blue in the reference summary).</p><p>The last few years have seen significant progress on both extractive and abstractive approaches, of which a large number of studies are fueled by neural sequence-to-sequence models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>). One popular formulation of such models is an RNN/LSTM encoder that encodes the source passage to a fixed-size memory-state vector, and another RNN/LSTM decoder that generates the summary from this memory state. This paradigm is enhanced by attention mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015</ref>) and pointer network ( , such that the decoder can refer to (and weigh) all the encod-ing steps' hidden states or directly copy words from the source text, instead of relying solely on encoder's final memory state for all information about the source passage. Recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zeng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gu et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gulcehre et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">See et al., 2017</ref>) have demonstrated success with such seq-attention-seq and pointer models in summarization tasks.</p><p>While the advantage of attention and pointer models compared to vanilla sequence-to-sequence models in summarization is well supported by previous studies, these models still struggle to find the most salient information in the source text when generating summaries. This is because summarization, being different from other textto-text generation tasks (where there is an almost one-to-one correspondence between input and output words, e.g., machine translation), requires the sequence-attention-sequence model to additionally decide where to attend and where to ignore, thus demanding a strong encoder that can determine the importance of different words, phrases, and sentences and flexibly encode salient information in its memory state. To this end, we propose a novel 2-decoder architecture by adding another 'closed book' decoder without attention layer to a popular pointer-generator baseline, such that the 'closed book' decoder and pointer decoder share an encoder. We argue that this additional 'closed book' decoder encourages the encoder to be better at memorizing salient information from the source passage, and hence strengthen the entire model. We provide both intuition and evidence for this argument in the following paragraphs.</p><p>Consider the following case. Two students are learning to do summarization from scratch. During training, both students can first scan through the passage once (encoder's pass). Then student A is allowed to constantly look back (attention) at the passage when writing the summary (similar to a pointer-generator model), while student B has to occasionally write the summary without looking back (similar to our 2-decoder model with a non-attention/copy decoder). During the final test, both students can look at the passage while writing summaries. We argue that student B will write more salient summaries in the test because s/he learns to better distill and memorize important information in the first scan/pass by not looking back at the passage in training.</p><p>In terms of back-propagation intuition, during the training of a seq-attention-seq model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">See et al. (2017)</ref>), most gradients are back-propagated from the decoder to the encoder's hidden states through the attention layer. This encourages the encoder to correctly encode salient words at the corresponding encoding steps, but does make sure that this information is not forgotten (overwritten in the memory state) by the encoder afterward. However, for a plain LSTM (closed-book) decoder without attention, its generated gradient flow is back-propagated to the encoder through the memory state, which is the only connection between itself and the encoder, and this, therefore, encourages the encoder to encode only the salient, important information in its memory state. Hence, to achieve this desired effect, we jointly train the two decoders, which share one encoder, by optimizing the weighted sum of their losses. This approximates the training routine of student B because the sole encoder has to perform well for both decoders. During inference, we only employ the pointer decoder due to its copying advantage over the closed-book decoder, similar to the situation of student B being able to refer back to the passage during the test for best performance (but is still trained hard to do well in both situations). <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows an example of our 2-decoder summarizer generating a summary that covers the original passage with more saliency than the baseline model.</p><p>Empirically, we test our 2-decoder architecture on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref>), and our model surpasses the strong pointer-generator baseline significantly on both ROUGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lin, 2004</ref>) and ME-TEOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Denkowski and Lavie, 2014</ref>) metrics, as well as based on human evaluation. This holds true both for a cross-entropy baseline as well as a stronger, policy-gradient based reinforcement learning setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Williams, 1992)</ref>. Moreover, our 2-decoder models (both cross-entropy and reinforced) also achieve reasonable improvements on a test-only generalizability/transfer setup on the DUC-2002 dataset.</p><p>We further present a series of numeric and qualitative analysis to understand whether the improvements in these automatic metric scores are in fact due to the enhanced memory and saliency strengths of our encoder. First, by evaluating the representation power of the encoder's final memory state after reading long passages (w.r.t. the memory state after reading ground-truth summaries) via a cosine-similarity test, we prove that our 2-decoder model indeed has a stronger encoder with better memory ability. Next, we conduct three sets of ablation studies based on fixedencoder, gradient-flow cut, and model capacity to show that the stronger encoder is the reason behind the significant improvements in ROUGE and ME-TEOR scores. Finally, we show that summaries generated by our 2-decoder model are qualitatively better than baseline summaries as the former achieved higher scores on two saliency metrics (based on cloze-Q&amp;A blanks and a keyword classifier) than the baseline summaries, while maintaining similar length and better avoiding repetitions. This directly demonstrates our 2-decoder model's enhanced ability to memorize and recover important information from the input document, which is our main contribution in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Extractive and Abstractive Summarization: Early models for automatic text summarization were usually extractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jing and McKeown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Knight and Marcu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clarke and La- pata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filippova et al., 2015</ref>). For abstractive summarization, different early non-neural approaches were applied, based on graphs <ref type="bibr">(Gian- nakopoulos, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ganesan et al., 2010)</ref>, discourse trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gerani et al., 2014</ref>), syntactic parse trees ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cheung and Penn, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al., 2013)</ref>, and a combination of linguistic compression and topic detection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zajic et al., 2004</ref>). Recent neuralnetwork models have tackled abstractive summarization using methods such as hierarchical encoders and attention, coverage, and distraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nal- lapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Takase et al., 2016</ref>) as well as various initial large-scale, shortlength summarization datasets like DUC-2004 and Gigaword.  adapted the CNN/Daily Mail ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hermann et al., 2015</ref>) dataset for long-text summarization, and provided an abstractive baseline using attentional sequence-tosequence model. Pointer Network for Summarization: Pointer networks ( ) are useful for summarization models because summaries often need to copy/contain a large number of words that have appeared in the source text. This provides the advantages of both extractive and abstractive approaches, and usually includes a gating function to model the distribution for the extended vocabulary including the pre-set vocabulary and words from the source text ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zeng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gu et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gulcehre et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miao and Blunsom, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">See et al. (2017)</ref> used a soft gate to control model's behavior of copying versus generating. They further applied coverage mechanism and achieved the state-of-the-art results on CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Memory Enhancement: Some recent works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gu et al., 2016a</ref>) have studied enhancing the memory capacity of sequence-to-sequence models. They studied this problem in Neural Machine Translation by keeping an external memory state analogous to data in the Von Neumann architecture, while the instructions are represented by the sequenceto-sequence model. Our work is novel in that we aim to improve the internal long-term memory of the encoder LSTM by adding a closed-book decoder that has no attention layer, yielding a more efficient internal memory that encodes only important information from the source text, which is crucial for the task of long-document summarization. Reinforcement Learning: Teacher forcing style maximum likelihood training suffers from exposure bias ( , so recent works instead apply reinforcement learning style policy gradient algorithms (REINFORCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Williams, 1992)</ref>) to directly optimize on metric scores ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Henß et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Paulus et al., 2018)</ref>. Reinforced models that employ this method have achieved good results in a number of tasks including image captioning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ranzato et al., 2016)</ref>, machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Norouzi et al., 2016)</ref>, and text summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ranzato et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Paulus et al., 2018</ref>).</p></div>

(2017)</ref> can be seen as a hybrid of extractive and abstractive summarization models. At each decoding step, the model can either sample a word from its vocabulary, or copy a word directly from the source passage. This is enabled by the attention mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, which includes a distribution a i over all encoding steps, and a context vector c t that is the weighted sum of encoder's hidden states. The attention mechanism  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Our 2-decoder summarization model with a pointer decoder and a closed-book decoder, both sharing a single encoder (this is during training; next, at inference time, we only employ the memory-enhanced encoder and the pointer decoder). is modeled as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e t i = v T tanh(W h h i + W s s t + b attn ) a t i = softmax(e t i ); c t = i a t i h i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v, W h , W s , and b attn are learnable parameters. h i is encoder's hidden state at i th encoding step, and s t is decoder's hidden state at t th decoding step. The distribution a t i can be seen as the amount of attention at decode step t towards the i th encoder state. Therefore, the context vector c t is the sum of the encoder's hidden states weighted by attention distribution a t .</p><p>At each decoding step, the previous context vector c t−1 is concatenated with current input x t , and fed through a non-linear recurrent function along with the previous hidden state s t−1 to produce the new hidden state s t . The context vector c t is then calculated according to Eqn. 1 and concatenated with the decoder state s t to produce the logits for the vocabulary distribution P vocab at decode step t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P t vocab = softmax(V 2 (V 1 [s t , c t ]+b 1 )+b 2 ), where V 1 , V 2 , b 1 , b 2</formula><p>are learnable parameters. To enable copying out-of-vocabulary words from source text, a pointer similar to  is built upon the attention distribution and controlled by the generation probability p gen :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p t gen = σ(U c c t + U s s t + U x x t + b ptr ) P t attn (w) = p t gen P t vocab (w) + (1 − p t gen ) i:w i =w a t i</formula><p>where U c , U s , U x , and b ptr are learnable parameters. x t and s t are the input token and decoder's state at t th decoding step. σ is the sigmoid function. We can see p gen as a soft gate that controls the model's behavior of copying from text with attention distribution a t i versus sampling from vocabulary with generation distribution P t vocab .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Closed-Book Decoder</head><p>As shown in Eqn. 1, the attention distribution a i depends on decoder's hidden state s t , which is derived from decoder's memory state c t . If c t does not encode salient information from the source text or encodes too much unimportant information, the decoder will have a hard time to locate relevant encoder states with attention. However, as explained in the introduction, most gradients are back-propagated through attention layer to the encoder's hidden state h t , not directly to the final memory state, and thus provide little incentive for the encoder to memorize salient information in c t . Therefore, to enhance encoder's memory, we add a closed-book decoder, which is a unidirectional LSTM decoder without attention/pointer layer. The two decoders share a single encoder and word-embedding matrix, while out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are simply represented as <ref type="bibr">[UNK]</ref> for the closed-book decoder. The entire 2-decoder model is represented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. During training, we optimize the weighted sum of negative log likelihoods from the two decoders:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L XE = 1 T T t=1 − ((1 − γ) log P t attn (w|x 1:t ) + γ log P t cbdec (w|x 1:t ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P cbdec is the generation probability from the closed-book decoder. The mix ratio γ is tuned on the validation set.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: ROUGE F1 and METEOR scores (noncoverage) on CNN/Daily Mail test set of previous works and our models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Memory Similarity Test</head><p>To verify our argument that the closed-book decoder improves the encoder's memory ability, we design a test to numerically evaluate the representation power of encoder's final memory state. We perform two forward passes for each encoder (2-decoder versus pointer-generator baseline). For the first pass, we feed the entire article to the encoder and collect the final memory state; for the second pass we feed the ground-truth summary to the encoder and collect the final memory state. Then we calculate the cosine similarity between these two memory-state vectors. For an optimal summarization model, its encoder's memory state after reading the entire article should be highly similar to its memory state after reading the ground truth summary (which contains all the important information), because this shows that when reading a long passage, the model is only encoding important information in its memory and forgets the unimportant information. The results in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> show that the encoder of our 2-decoder model achieves significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher article-summary similarity score than the encoder of a pointer-generator baseline. This observation verifies our hypothesis that the closed-book decoder can improve the memory ability of the encoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Ablation Studies and Sanity Check</head><p>Fixed-Encoder Ablation: Next, we conduct an ablation study in order to prove the qualitative superiority of our 2-decoder model's encoder to the baseline encoder. To do this, we train two pointergenerators with randomly initialized decoders and word embeddings. For the first model, we restore the pre-trained encoder from our pointer-generator baseline; for the second model, we restore the pretrained encoder from our 2-decoder model. We then fix the encoder's parameters for both models during the training, only updating the embeddings and decoders with gradient descent. As shown in the upper half of <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>, the pointer-generator with our 2-decoder model's encoder receives significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) scores in ROUGE than the pointer-generator with baseline's encoder.</p><p>Since these two models have the exact same structure with only the encoders initialized according to different pre-trained models, the significant improvements in metric scores suggest that our 2-decoder model does have a stronger encoder than the pointer-generator baseline. Gradient-Flow-Cut Ablation: We further design another ablation test to identify how the gradients from the closed-book decoder influence the entire model during training. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> demonstrates the forward pass (solid line) and gradient flow (dashed line) between encoder, decoders, and embeddings in our 2-decoder model. As we can see, the closedbook decoder only depends on the word embeddings and encoder. Therefore it can affect the entire model during training by influencing either the encoder or the word-embedding matrix. When we stop the gradient flow between the encoder and closed-book decoder ( 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4)</ref>, and keep the flow between closed-book decoder and embedding matrix ( 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>), we observe non-significant improvements in ROUGE compared to the baseline. On the other hand, when we stop the gradient flow at 2 and keep 1 , the improvements are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) (see the lower half    of <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>). This proves that the gradients backpropagated from closed-book decoder to the encoder can strengthen the entire model, and hence verifies the gradient-flow intuition discussed in introduction (Sec. 1).</p><p>Model Capacity: To validate and sanity-check that the improvements are the result of the inclusion of our closed-book decoder and not due to some trivial effects of having two decoders or larger model capacity (more parameters), we train a variant of our model with two duplicated (initialized to be different) attention-pointer decoders. We also evaluate a pointer-generator baseline with 2-layer encoder and decoder (pg-2layer) and increase the LSTM hidden dimension and word embedding dimension of the pointer-generator baseline (pg-big) to exceed the total number of parameters of our 2-decoder model (34.5M versus 34.4M parameters). <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 7</ref> shows that neither of these variants can match our 2-decoder model in terms of ROUGE and METEOR scores, and hence proves that the improvements of our model are indeed because of the closed-book decoder rather than due to simply having more parameters. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Mixed-loss Ratio Ablation: We also present eval-    uation results (on the CNN/Daily Mail validation set) of our 2-decoder models with different closedbook-decoder:pointer-decoder mixed-loss ratio (γ in Eqn. 2) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8</ref>. The model achieves the best ROUGE and METEOR scores at γ = 2 3 . Comparing <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 8 with Table 5</ref>, we observe a similar trend between the increasing ROUGE/METEOR scores and increasing memory cosine-similarities, which suggests that the performance of a pointergenerator is strongly correlated with the representation power of the encoder's final memory state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Saliency and Repetition</head><p>Finally, we show that our 2-decoder model can make use of this better encoder memory state to summarize more salient information from the source text, as well as to avoid generating unnecessarily lengthy and repeated sentences besides achieving significant improvements on ROUGE and METEOR metrics. Saliency: To evaluate saliency, we design a keyword-matching test based on the original CNN/Daily Mail cloze blank-filling task <ref type="bibr">(Her- mann et al., 2015)</ref>. Each news article in the dataset is marked with a few cloze-blank keywords that represent salient entities, including names, locations, etc. We count the number of keywords that appear in our generated summaries, and found that the output of our best teacher-forcing model (pg+cbdec with coverage) contains 62.1% of those keywords, while the output provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">See et al. (2017)</ref>    parison is shown in the first column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 9</ref>. We also use the saliency metric in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pasunuru and Bansal (2018)</ref>, which finds important words detected via a keyword classifier (trained on the SQuAD dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>). The results are shown in the second column of Table 9. Both saliency tests again demonstrate our 2-decoder model's ability to memorize important information and address them properly in the generated summary. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> show two examples of summaries generated by our 2-decoder model compared to baseline summaries. Summary Length: On average, summaries generated by our 2-decoder model have 66.42 words per summary, while the pointer-generator-baseline summaries have 65.88 words per summary (and the same effect holds true for RL models, where there is less than 1-word difference in average length). This shows that our 2-decoder model is able to achieve higher saliency with similar-length summaries (i.e., it is not capturing more salient content simply by generating longer summaries).</p><p>Repetition: We observe that out 2-decoder model can generate summaries that are less redundant compared to the baseline, when both models are not trained with coverage mechanism. <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 10</ref> shows the percentage of repeated n-grams/sentences in summaries generated by the pointer-generator baseline and our 2-decoder model. Abstractiveness: Abstractiveness is another major challenge for current abstractive summarization models other than saliency. Since our baseline is an abstractive model, we measure the percentage of novel n-grams (n=2, 3, 4) in our generated summaries, and find that our 2-decoder model generates 1.8%, 4.8%, 7.6% novel n-grams while our baseline summaries have 1.6%, 4.4%, 7.1% on the same test set. Even though generating more abstractive summaries is not our focus in this paper, we still show that our improvements in metric and saliency scores are not obtained at the cost of making the model more extractive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Discussion: Connection to Multi-Task Learning</head><p>Our 2-decoder model somewhat resembles a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model, in that both try to improve the model with extra knowledge that is not available to the original single-task baseline. While our model uses MTL-style parameter sharing to introduce extra knowledge from the same dataset, traditional Multi-Task Learning usually employs additional/out-of-domain auxiliary tasks/datasets as related knowledge (e.g., translation with 2 language-pairs). Our 2-decoder model is more about how to learn to do a single task from two different points of view, as the pointer decoder is a hybrid of extractive and abstractive summarization models (primary view), and the closedbook decoder is trained for abstractive summarization only (auxiliary view). The two decoders share their encoder and embeddings, which helps enrich the encoder's final memory state representation. Moreover, as shown in Sec. 6.2, our 2-decoder model (pg + cbdec) significantly outperforms the 2-duplicate-decoder model (pg + ptrdec) as well as single-decoder models with more layers/parameters, hence proving that our design of the auxiliary view (closed-book decoder doing abstractive summarization) is the reason behind the improved performance, rather than some simplistic effects of having a 2-decoder ensemble or higher #parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a 2-decoder sequence-to-sequence architecture for summarization with a closed-book decoder that helps the encoder to better memorize salient information from the source text. On CNN/Daily Mail dataset, our proposed model significantly outperforms the pointer-generator baselines in terms of ROUGE and METEOR scores (in both a cross-entropy (XE) setup and a reinforcement learning (RL) setup). It also achieves improvements in a test-only transfer setup on the DUC-2002 dataset in both XE and RL cases. We further showed that our 2-decoder model indeed has a stronger encoder with better memory capabilities, and can generate summaries with more salient information from the source text. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the "representation power" of the encoders final state in an encoder-decoder model. Furthermore, our simple, insightful 2-decoder architecture can also be useful for other tasks that require long-term memory from the encoder, e.g., long-context QA/dialogue and captioning for long videos.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: The summary generated by our 2-decoder model covers salient information (highlighted in red) mentioned in the reference summary, which is not presented in the baseline summary.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Our improvements in Table 1 are statistically significant with p &lt; 0.001 (using bootstrapped randomization test with 100k samples (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994)) and have a 95% ROUGE-significance interval of at most ±0.25.</note>
