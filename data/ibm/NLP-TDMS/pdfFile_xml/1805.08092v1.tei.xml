<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of textual question answering (QA), in which a machine reads a document and answers a question, is an important and challenging problem in natural language processing. Recent progress in performance of QA models has been largely due to the variety of available QA datasets <ref type="bibr">(Richardson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajpurkar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Trischler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kočiskỳ et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Many neural QA models have been proposed for these datasets, the most successful of which tend to leverage coattention or bidirectional attention mechanisms that build codependent representations of the document and the question <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Xiong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seo et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Yet, learning the full context over the document is challenging and inefficient. In particular, when the model is given a long document, or multiple documents, learning the full context is intractably slow and hence difficult to scale to large corpora. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Jia and Liang (2017)</ref> show that, given adversarial inputs, such models tend to focus on wrong parts of the context and produce incorrect answers.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to develop a QA system that is scalable to large documents as well as robust to adversarial inputs. First, we study the context required to answer the question by sampling examples in the dataset and carefully analyzing them. We find that most questions can be answered using a few sentences, without the consideration of context over entire document. In particular, we observe that on the SQuAD dataset <ref type="bibr">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>, 92% of answerable questions can be answered using a single sentence.</p><p>Second, inspired by this observation, we propose a sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to give to the QA model in order to answer the question. Since the minimum number of sentences depends on the question, our sentence selector chooses a different number of sentences for each question, in contrast with previous models that select a fixed number of sentences. Our sentence selector leverages three simple techniques -weight transfer, data modification and score normalization, which we show to be highly effective on the task of sentence selection.</p><p>We compare the standard QA model given the full document (FULL) and the QA model given the Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla Who did Tesla call in the middle of the night? rarely slept . Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m. : "I was sleeping in my room (...) Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... N/A 2 12 Writers whose papers are in the library are as diverse as Charles Dickens and The papers of which famous English Victorian Beatrix Potter. Illuminated manuscripts in the library dating from <ref type="bibr">(...)</ref> author are collected in the library?  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task analyses</head><p>Existing QA models focus on learning the context over different parts in the full document. Although effective, learning the context within the full document is challenging and inefficient. Consequently, we study the minimal context in the document required to answer the question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Human studies</head><p>First, we randomly sample 50 examples from the SQuAD development set, and analyze the minimum number of sentences required to answer the question, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. We observed that 98% of questions are answerable given the document. The remaining 2% of questions are not answerable even given the entire document. For instance, in the last example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the question requires the background knowledge that Charles Dickens is an English Victorian author. Among the answerable examples, 92% are answerable with a single sentence, 6% with two sentences, and 2% with three or more sentences. We perform a similar analysis on the TriviaQA (Wikipedia) development (verified) set. Finding the sentences to answer the question on TriviaQA is more challenging than on SQuAD, since Triv-iaQA documents are much longer than SQuAD documents (488 vs 5 sentences per document). Nevertheless, we find that most examples are answerable with one or two sentences -among the 88% of examples that are answerable given the full document, 95% can be answered with one or two sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analyses on existing QA model</head><p>Given that the majority of examples are answerable with a single oracle sentence on SQuAD, we analyze the performance of an existing, competitive QA model when it is given the oracle sentence. We train DCN+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Xiong et al., 2018)</ref>, one of the state-of-the-art models on SQuAD (details in Section 3.1), on the oracle sentence. The model achieves 83.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the full document and 85.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the oracle sentence. We analyze 50 randomly sampled examples in which the model fails on exact match (EM) despite using the oracle sentence. We classify these errors into 4 categories, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. In these examples, we observed that 40% of questions are answerable given the oracle sentence but the model unexpectedly fails to find the answer. 58% are those in which the model's prediction is correct but does not lexically match the groundtruth answer, as shown in the first example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. 2% are those in which the question is not answerable even given the full document. In addition, we compare predictions by the model trained using the full document (FULL) with the model trained on the oracle sentence (ORACLE). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the Venn diagram of the questions answered correctly by FULL and ORACLE on SQuAD and NewsQA. ORACLE is able to answer 93% and 86% of the questions correctly answered by FULL on SQuAD and NewsQA, respectively.</p><p>These experiments and analyses indicate that if the model can accurately predict the oracle sentence, the model should be able to achieve comparable performance on overall QA task. Therefore, we aim to create an effective, efficient and robust QA system which only requires a single or a few sentences to answer the question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>Our overall architecture ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) consists of a sentence selector and a QA model. The sentence selector computes a selection score for each sentence in parallel. We give to the QA model a reduced set of sentences with high selection scores to answer the question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Neural Question Answering Model</head><p>We study two neural QA models that obtain close to state-of-the-art performance on SQuAD. DCN+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Xiong et al., 2018)</ref> is one of the start- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentence Selector</head><p>Our sentence selector scores each sentence with respect to the question in parallel. The score indicates whether the question is answerable with this sentence. The model architecture is divided into the encoder module and the decoder module. The encoder is a shared module with S-Reader, which computes sentence encodings and question encodings from the sentence and the question as inputs. First, the encoder computes sentence embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D ∈ R h d ×L d , question embeddings Q ∈ R h d ×Lq , and question-aware sentence embeddings D q ∈ R h d ×L d ,</formula><p>where h d is the dimension of word embeddings, and L d and L q are the sequence length of the document and the question, respectively. Specifically, question-aware sentence embeddings are obtained as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α i = softmax(D T i W 1 Q) ∈ R Lq (1) D q i = Lq j=1 (α i,j Q j ) ∈ R h d<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, D i ∈ R h d is the hidden state of sentence embedding for the i th word and </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W 1 ∈ R h d ×h d is Embed Matrix Embed Matrix BiLSTM BiLSTM … L D Sentence … L Q D … … Question Q … … … D enc Q enc … … D enc Q enc Linear+Softmax … score start BiLinear score end … D enc … BiLinear … … D enc Q enc</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">D enc = BiLSTM([D i ; D q i ]) ∈ R h×L d (3) Q enc = BiLSTM(Q j ) ∈ R h×Lq<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, ';' denotes the concatenation of two vectors, and h is a hyperparameter of the hidden dimension.</p><p>Next, the decoder is a task-specific module which computes the score for the sentence by calculating bilinear similarities between sentence encodings and question encodings as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">β = softmax(w T Q enc ) ∈ R Lq (5) q enc = Lq j=1 (β j Q enc j ) ∈ R h (6)h i = (D enc i W 2q enc ) ∈ R h (7) h = max(h 1 ,h 2 , · · · ,h L d ) (8) score = W T 3h ∈ R 2 (9) Here, w ∈ R h , W 2 ∈ R h×h×h , W 3 ∈ R h×2</formula><p>, are trainable weight matrices. Each dimension in score means the question is answerable or nonanswerable given the sentence.</p><p>We introduce 3 techniques to train the model. (i) As the encoder module of our model is identical to that of S-Reader, we transfer the weights to the encoder module from the QA model trained on the single oracle sentence (ORACLE). (ii) We modify the training data by treating a sentence as a wrong sentence if the QA model gets 0 F1, even if the sentence is the oracle sentence. (iii) After we  obtain the score for each sentence, we normalize scores across sentences from the same paragraph, similar to Clark and Gardner (2017). All of these three techniques give substantial improvements in sentence selection accuracy, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. More details including hyperparameters and training procedures are shown in Appendix A.</p><p>Because the minimal set of sentences required to answer the question depends on the question, we select the set of sentences by thresholding the sentence scores, where the threshold is a hyperparameter (details in Appendix A). This method allows the model to select a variable number of sentences for each question, as opposed to a fixed number of sentences for all questions. Also, by controlling the threshold, the number of sentences can be dynamically controlled during the inference. We define Dyn (for Dynamic) as this method, and define Top k as the method which simply selects the top-k sentences for each question.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset and Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We train and evaluate our model on five different datasets as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SQuAD</head><p>(Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is a wellstudied QA dataset on Wikipedia articles that requires each question to be answered from a paragraph.</p><p>NewsQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Trischler et al., 2016</ref>) is a dataset on news articles that also provides a paragraph for each question, but the paragraphs are longer than those in SQuAD.</p><p>TriviaQA SQuAD-Adversarial (Jia and Liang, 2017) is a variant of SQuAD. It shares the same training set as SQuAD, but an adversarial sentence is added to each paragraph in a subset of the development set.</p><p>We use accuracy (Acc) and mean average precision (MAP) to evaluate sentence selection. We also measure the average number of selected sentences (N sent) to compare the efficiency of our Dyn method and the Top k method.</p><p>To evaluate the performance in the task of question answering, we measure F1 and EM (Exact Match), both being standard metrics for evaluating span-based QA. In addition, we measure training speed (Train Sp) and inference speed (Infer Sp) relative to the speed of standard QA model (FULL). The speed is measured using a single GPU (Tesla K80), and includes the training and inference time for the sentence selector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SQuAD and NewsQA</head><p>For each QA model, we experiment with three types of inputs. First, we use the full document (FULL). Next, we give the model the oracle sentence containing the groundtruth answer span (ORACLE). Finally, we select sentences using our sentence selector (MINIMAL), using both Top k and Dyn. We also compare this last method with TF-IDF method for sentence selection, which selects sentences using n-gram TF-IDF distance between each sentence and the question.   Results <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> shows results in the task of sentence selection on SQuAD and NewsQA. First, our selector outperforms TF-IDF method and the previous state-of-the-art by large margin (up to 2.9% MAP).</p><p>Second, our three training techniques -weight transfer, data modification and score normalization -improve performance by up to 5.6% MAP. Finally, our Dyn method achieves higher accuracy with less sentences than the Top k method. For example, on SQuAD, Top 2 achieves 97.2 accuracy, whereas Dyn achieves 99.3 accuracy with  FastQA , which are the model leveraging sentence selection for question answering, and the published state-of-the-art models on SQuAD and NewsQA, respectively.</p><p>a Numbers on the test set.</p><p>1.9 sentences per example. On NewsQA, Top 4 achieves 92.5 accuracy, whereas Dyn achieves 94.6 accuracy with 3.9 sentences per example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows that the number of sentences selected by Dyn method vary substantially on both SQuAD and NewsQA. This shows that Dyn chooses a different number of sentences depending on the question, which reflects our intuition. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> shows results in the task of QA on SQuAD and NewsQA. MINIMAL is more efficient in training and inference than FULL. On SQuAD, S-Reader achieves 6.7× training and 3.6× inference speedup on SQuAD, and 15.0× training and 6.9× inference speedup on NewsQA. In addition to the speedup, MINIMAL achieves comparable result to FULL (using S-Reader, 79.9 vs 79.8 F1 on SQuAD and 63.8 vs 63.2 F1 on NewsQA).</p><p>We compare the predictions from FULL and MINIMAL in How many casualties did British get? This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism.

In the above two examples, MINIMAL correctly answer the question by selecting the oracle sentence. In the last example, MINIMAL fails to answer the question, since the inference over first and second sentences is required to answer the question. selected sentence However, in 1883-84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific, before losing interest in imperialism.

In the last example, our sentence selector fails to choose the oracle sentence, so the QA model cannot predict the correct answer. In this case, our selector chooses the second and the third sentences instead of the oracle sentence because the former contains more information relevant to question. In fact, the context over the first and the second sentences is required to correctly answer the question. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows an example on SQuAD, which MINIMAL with Dyn correctly answers the question, and MINIMAL with Top k sometimes does not. Top 1 selects one sentence in the first example, thus fails to choose the oracle sentence. Top 2 selects two sentences in the second example, which is inefficient as well as leads to the wrong answer. In both examples, Dyn selects the oracle sentence with minimum number of sentences, and subsequently predicts the answer. More analyses are shown in Appendix B.</p></div>

They do not provide the answer span and only provide the question-answer pairs. For each QA model, we experiment with two types of inputs.</p><p>First, since TriviaQA and SQuAD-Open have many documents for each question, we first filter paragraphs based on the TF-IDF similarities between the question and the paragraph, and then feed the full paragraphs to the QA model (FULL). On TriviaQA, we choose the top 10 paragraphs for training and inference. On SQuAD-Open, we choose the top 20 paragraphs for training and the top 40 for inferences. Next, we use our sentence selector with Dyn (MINIMAL). We select 5-20 sentences using our sentence selector, from 200 sentences based on TF-IDF.</p><p>For training the sentence selector, we use two techniques described in Section 3.2, weight transfer and score normalization, but we do not use data modification technique, since there are too many sentences to feed each of them to the QA model.

For training FULL and MINIMAL on SQuAD-Open, we use 20 paragraphs and 20 sentences, respectively. For evaluating FULL and MINIMAL, we use 40 paragraphs and 5-20 sentences, respectively. 'n sent' indicates the number of sentences used during inference. 'Acc' indicates accuracy of whether answer text is contained in selected context. 'Sp' indicates inference speed.

First, MINI-MAL obtains higher F1 and EM over FULL, with the inference speedup of up to 13.8×.

For example, on the development-full set, with 5 sentences per question on average, the model with Dyn achieves 59.5 F1 while the model with TF-IDF method achieves 51.9 F1.

The decoder module obtains the scores for start and end position of the answer span by calculating bilinear similarities between document encodings and question encodings as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β = softmax(w T 1 Q enc ) ∈ R Lq (10) q enc = Lq j=1 (β j Q enc j ) ∈ R h (11) score start = D enc W startq enc ∈ R L d (12) score end = D enc W endq enc ∈ RL d (13) Here, w 1 ∈ R h , W start , W end ∈ R h×h are trainable weight matrices.</formula><p>The overall architecture is similar to Document Reader in <ref type="bibr">DrQA (Chen et al., 2017)</ref>, except they are different in obtaining embeddings and use different hyperparameters. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>, our S-Reader obtains F1 score of 79.9 on SQuAD development data, while Document Reader in DrQA achieves 78.8.</p><p>Training details We implement all of our models using PyTorch. First, the corpus is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP toolkit <ref type="bibr">(Manning et al., 2014)</ref>. We obtain the embeddings of the document and the question by concatenating 300-dimensional Glove embeddings pretrained on the 840B Common Crawl corpus <ref type="bibr">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, 100-dimensional character ngram embeddings by <ref type="bibr">Hashimoto et al. (2017)</ref>, and 300-dimensional contextualized embeddings pretrained on <ref type="bibr">WMT (McCann et al., 2017)</ref>. We do not use handcraft word features such as POS and NER tagging, which is different from Document Reader in DrQA. Hence, the dimension of the embedding (d h ) is 600. We use the hidden size (h) of 200. We apply dropout with 0.2 drop rate <ref type="bibr">(Srivastava et al., 2014)</ref> to encodings and LSTMs for regularization. We train the models using ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with default hyper-parameters. When we train and evaluate the model on the dataset, the document is truncated to the maximum length of min(2000, max(1000, L th )) words, where L th is the length which covers 90% of documents in the whole examples.</p><p>Selection details Here, we describe how to dynamically select sentences using Dyn method. Given the sentences S all = {s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , ..., s n }, ordered by scores from the sentence selector in descending order, the selected sentences S selected is as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S candidate = {s i ∈ S all |score(s i ) &gt;= 1 − th} (14) S selected = S candidate if S candidate = ∅ {s 1 } o.w.<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Here, score(s i ) is the score of sentence s i from the sentence selector, and th is a hyperparameter between 0 and 1.</p><p>The number of sentences to select can be dynamically controlled during inference by adjusting th, so that proper number of sentences can be selected depending on the needs of accuracy and speed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the trade-off between the number of sentences and accuracy, as well as the number of selected sentences depending on the threshold th.</p></div>

In the first example classified into 'N/A', the question is not answerable even given whole documents, because there is no word 'corlourful' or 'enchantment' in the given documents. In the next example, the question is also not answerable even given whole documents, because all sentences containing 'London' does not contain any information about Canaletto's landscapes.</p><p>In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass, he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation.</p><p>What did Luther call the mass instead of sacrifice?
