<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Optical flow is the task of estimating per-pixel motion between video frames. It is a long-standing vision problem that remains unsolved. The best systems are limited by difficulties including fast-moving objects, occlusions, motion blur, and textureless surfaces.</p><p>Optical flow has traditionally been approached as a hand-crafted optimization problem over the space of dense displacement fields between a pair of images <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Generally, the optimization objective defines a trade-off between a data term which encourages the alignment of visually similar image regions and a regularization term which imposes priors on the plausibility of motion. Such an approach has achieved considerable success, but further progress has appeared challenging, due to the difficulties in hand-designing an optimization objective that is robust to a variety of corner cases.</p><p>Recently, deep learning has been shown as a promising alternative to traditional methods. Deep learning can side-step formulating an optimization problem and train a network to directly predict flow. Current deep learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> have achieved performance comparable to the best traditional methods while being significantly faster at inference time. A key question for further research is designing effective architectures that perform better, train more easily and generalize well to novel scenes.</p><p>We introduce Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT), a new deep network architecture for optical flow. <ref type="bibr">RAFT</ref>   -State-of-the-art accuracy: On KITTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, RAFT achieves an F1-all error of 5.10%, a 16% error reduction from the best published result (6.10%). On Sintel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (final pass), RAFT obtains an end-point-error of 2.855 pixels, a 30% error reduction from the best published result (4.098 pixels). -Strong generalization: When trained only on synthetic data, RAFT achieves an end-point-error of 5.04 pixels on KITTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a 40% error reduction from the best prior deep network trained on the same data (8.36 pixels). -High efficiency: RAFT processes 1088×436 videos at 10 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU. It trains with 10X fewer iterations than other architectures. A smaller version of RAFT with 1/5 of the parameters runs at 20 frames per second while still outperforming all prior methods on Sintel.</p><p>RAFT consists of three main components: (1) a feature encoder that extracts a feature vector for each pixel; (2) a correlation layer that produces a 4D correlation volume for all pairs of pixels, with subsequent pooling to produce lower resolution volumes; (3) a recurrent GRU-based update operator that retrieves values from the correlation volumes and iteratively updates a flow field initialized at zero. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> illustrates the design of RAFT.</p><p>The RAFT architecture is motivated by traditional optimization-based approaches. The feature encoder extracts per-pixel features. The correlation layer computes visual similarity between pixels. The update operator mimics the steps of an iterative optimization algorithm. But unlike traditional approaches, features and motion priors are not handcrafted but learned-learned by the feature encoder and the update operator respectively.</p><p>The design of RAFT draws inspiration from many existing works but is substantially novel. First, RAFT maintains and updates a single fixed flow field at high resolution. This is different from the prevailing coarse-to-fine design in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, where flow is first estimated at low resolution and upsampled and refined at high resolution. By operating on a single high-resolution flow field, RAFT overcomes several limitations of a coarse-to-fine cascade: the difficulty of recovering from errors at coarse resolutions, the tendency to miss small fast-moving objects, and the many training iterations (often over 1M) typically required for training a multi-stage cascade.</p><p>Second, the update operator of RAFT is recurrent and lightweight. Many recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> have included some form of iterative refinement, but do not tie the weights across iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and are therefore limited to a fixed number of iterations. To our knowledge, IRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is the only deep learning approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that is recurrent. It uses FlowNetS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or PWC-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> as its recurrent unit. When using FlowNetS, it is limited by the size of the network (38M parameters) and is only applied up to 5 iterations. When using PWC-Net, iterations are limited by the number of pyramid levels. In contrast, our update operator has only 2.7M parameters and can be applied 100+ times during inference without divergence.</p><p>Third, the update operator has a novel design, which consists of a convolutional GRU that performs lookups on 4D multi-scale correlation volumes; in contrast, refinement modules in prior work typically use only plain convolution or correlation layers.</p><p>We conduct experiments on Sintel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and KITTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Results show that RAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. In addition, we validate various design choices of RAFT through extensive ablation studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Optical Flow as Energy Minimization Optical flow has traditionally been treated as an energy minimization problem which imposes a tradeoff between a data term and a regularization term. Horn and Schnuck <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> formulated optical flow as a continuous optimization problem using a variational framework, and were able to estimate a dense flow field by performing gradient steps. Black and Anandan <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> addressed problems with oversmoothing and noise sensitivity by introducing a robust estimation framework. TV-L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> replaced the quadratic penalties with an L1 data term and total variation regularization, which allowed for motion discontinuities and was better equipped to handle outliers. Improvements have been made by defining better matching costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and regularization terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Such continuous formulations maintain a single estimate of optical flow which is refined at each iteration. To ensure a smooth objective function, a first order Taylor approximation is used to model the data term. As a result, they only work well for small displacements. To handle large displacements, the coarse-to-fine strategy is used, where an image pyramid is used to estimate large displacements at low resolution, then small displacements refined at high resolution. But this coarse-to-fine strategy may miss small fast-moving objects and have difficulty recovering from early mistakes. Like continuous methods, we maintain a single estimate of optical flow which is refined with each iteration. However, since we build correlation volumes for all pairs at both high resolution and low resolution, each local update uses information about both small and large displacements. In addition, instead of using a subpixel Taylor approximation of the data term, our update operator learns to propose the descent direction.</p><p>More recently, optical flow has also been approached as a discrete optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> using a global objective. One challenge of this approach is the massive size of the search space, as each pixel can be reasonably paired with thousands of points in the other frame. Menez et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> pruned the search space using feature descriptors and approximated the global MAP estimate using message passing. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that by using the distance transform, solving the global optimization problem over the full space of flow fields is tractable. DCFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> showed further improvements by using a neural network as a feature descriptor, and constructed a 4D cost volume over all pairs of features. The 4D cost volume was then processed using the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Like DCFlow, we also constructed 4D cost volumes over learned features. However, instead of processing the cost volumes using SGM, we use a neural network to estimate flow. Our approach is end-to-end differentiable, meaning the feature encoder can be trained with the rest of the network to directly minimize the error of the final flow estimate. In contrast, DCFlow requires their network to be trained using an embedding loss between pixels; it cannot be trained directly on optical flow because their cost volume processing is not differentiable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct Flow Prediction</head><p>Neural networks have been trained to directly predict optical flow between a pair of frames, side-stepping the optimization problem completely. Coarse-to-fine processing has emerged as a popular ingredient in many recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. In contrast, our method maintains and updates a single high-resolution flow field.</p><p>Iterative Refinement for Optical Flow Many recent works have used iterative refinement to improve results on optical flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> and related tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Ilg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> applied iterative refinement to optical flow by stacking multiple FlowNetS and FlowNetC modules in series. SpyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, PWC-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, LiteFlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and VCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> apply iterative refinement using coarse-to-fine pyramids. The main difference of these approaches from ours is that they do not share weights between iterations.</p><p>More closely related to our approach is IRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which builds off of the FlownetS and PWC-Net architecture but shares weights between refinement networks. When using FlowNetS, it is limited by the size of the network (38M parameters) and is only applied up to 5 iterations. When using PWC-Net, iterations are limited by the number of pyramid levels. In contrast, we use a much simpler refinement module (2.7M parameters) which can be applied for 100+ iterations during inference without divergence. Our method also shares similarites with Devon <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, namely the construction of the cost volume without warping and fixed resolution updates. However, Devon does not have any recurrent unit. It also differs from ours regarding large displacements. Devon handles large displacements using a dilated cost volume while our approach pools the correlation volume at multiple resolutions.</p><p>Our method also has ties to TrellisNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Trellis net uses depth tied weights over a large number of layers, DEQ simulates an infinite number of layers by solving for the fixed point directly. TrellisNet and DEQ were designed for sequence modeling tasks, but we adopt the core idea of using a large number of weight-tied units. Our update operator uses a modified GRU block <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which is similar to the LSTM block used in TrellisNet. We found that this structure allows our update operator to more easily converge to a fixed flow field. Learning to Optimize Many problems in vision can be formulated as an optimization problem. This has motivated several works to embed optimization problems into network architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. These works typically use a network to predict the inputs or parameters of the optimization problem, and then train the network weights by backpropogating the gradient through the solver, either implicitly <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> or unrolling each step <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. However, this technique is limited to problems with an objective that can be easily defined.</p><p>Another approach is to learn iterative updates directly from data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. These approaches are motivated by the fact that first order optimizers such as Primal Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> can be expressed as a sequence of iterative update steps. Instead of using an optimizer directly, Adler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed building a network which mimics the updates of a first order algorithm. This approach has been applied to inverse problems such as image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, tomographic reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and novel view synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. TVNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> implemented the TV-L1 algorithm as a computation graph, which enabled the training the TV-L1 parameters. However, TVNet operates directly based on intensity gradients instead of learned features, which limits the achievable accuracy on challenging datasets such as Sintel.</p><p>Our approach can be viewed as learning to optimize: our network uses a large number of update blocks to emulate the steps of a first-order optimization algorithm. However, unlike prior work, we never explicitly define a gradient with respect to some optimization objective. Instead, our network retrieves features from correlation volumes to propose the descent direction.</p></div>

Our method can be distilled down to three stages: (1) feature extraction, (2) computing visual similarity, and (3) iterative updates, where all stages are differentiable and composed into an end-to-end trainable architecture.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Image 1 Image 2 ∈ × × × 1 ∈ × × / 2 × / 2 2 ∈ × × / 4 × / 4 3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2: Building correlation volumes.</head><p>Here we depict 2D slices of a full 4D volume. For a feature vector in I 1 , we take take the inner product with all pairs in I 2 , generating a 4D W ×H ×W ×H volume (each pixel in I 2 produces a 2D response map). The volume is pooled using average pooling with kernel sizes {1, 2, 4, 8}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Feature Extraction</head><p>Features are extracted from the input images using a convolutional network. The feature encoder network is applied to both I 1 and I 2 and maps the input images to dense feature maps at a lower resolution. Our encoder, g θ outputs features at 1/8 resolution g θ : R H×W ×3 → R H/8×W/8×D where we set D = 256. The feature encoder consists of 6 residual blocks, 2 at 1/2 resolution, 2 at 1/4 resolution, and 2 at 1/8 resolution (more details in the supplemental material). We additionally use a context network. The context network extracts features only from the first input image I 1 . The architecture of the context network, h θ is identical to the feature extraction network. Together, the feature network g θ and the context network h θ form the first stage of our approach, which only need to be performed once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Computing Visual Similarity</head><p>We compute visual similarity by constructing a full correlation volume between all pairs. Given image features g θ (I 1 ) ∈ R H×W ×D and g θ (I 2 ) ∈ R H×W ×D , the correlation volume is formed by taking the dot product between all pairs of feature vectors. The correlation volume, C, can be efficiently computed as a single matrix multiplication.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C(g θ (I 1 ), g θ (I 2 )) ∈ R H×W ×H×W , C ijkl = h g θ (I 1 ) ijh · g θ (I 2 ) klh<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Correlation Pyramid: We construct a 4-layer pyramid {C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 } by pooling the last two dimensions of the correlation volume with kernel sizes 1, 2, 4, and 8 and equivalent stride ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Thus, volume C k has dimensions</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H × W × H/2 k × W/2 k .</formula><p>The set of volumes gives information about both large and small displacements; however, by maintaining the first 2 dimensions (the I 1 dimensions) we maintain high resolution information, allowing our method to recover the motions of small fast-moving objects.</p><p>Correlation Lookup: We define a lookup operator L C which generates a feature map by indexing from the correlation pyramid. Given a current estimate of optical flow (f 1 , f 2 ), we map each pixel x = (u, v) in I 1 to its estimated correspondence in I 2 : x = (u + f 1 (u), v + f 2 (v)). We then define a local grid around</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x N (x ) r = {x + dx | dx ∈ Z 2 , ||dx|| 1 ≤ r} (2)</formula><p>as the set of integer offsets which are within a radius of r units of x using the L1 distance. We use the local neighborhood N (x ) r to index from the correlation volume. Since N (x ) r is a grid of real numbers, we use bilinear sampling.</p><p>We perform lookups on all levels of the pyramid, such that the correlation volume at level k, C k , is indexed using the grid N (x /2 k ) r . A constant radius across levels means larger context at lower levels: for the lowest level, k = 4 using a radius of 4 corresponds to a range of 256 pixels at the original resolution. The values from each level are then concatenated into a single feature map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficient Computation for High Resolution Images:</head><p>The all pairs correlation scales O(N 2 ) where N is the number of pixels, but only needs to be computed once and is constant in the number of iterations M . However, there exists an equivalent implementation of our approach which scales O(N M ) exploiting the linearity of the inner product and average pooling. Consider the cost volume at level m, C m ijkl , and feature maps g (1) = g θ (I 1 ), g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> = g θ (I 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C m ijkl = 1 2 2m 2 m p 2 m q g (1) i,j , g (2) 2 m k+p,2 m l+q = g (1) i,j , 1 2 2m ( 2 m p 2 m q g (2) 2 m k+p,2 m l+q )</formula><p>which is the average over the correlation response in the 2 m × 2 m grid. This means that the value at C m ijkl can be computed as the inner product between the feature vector g θ (I 1 ) ij and g θ (I 2 ) pooled with kernel size 2 m × 2 m .</p><p>In this alternative implementation, we do not precompute the correlations, but instead precompute the pooled image feature maps. In each iteration, we compute each correlation value on demand-only when it is looked up. This gives a complexity of O(N M ).</p><p>We found empirically that precomputing all pairs is easy to implement and not a bottleneck, due to highly optimized matrix routines on GPUs-even for 1088x1920 videos it takes only 17% of total inference time. Note that we can always switch to the alternative implementation should it become a bottleneck.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Iterative Updates</head><p>Our update operator estimates a sequence of flow estimates {f 1 , ..., f N } from an initial starting point f 0 = 0. With each iteration, it produces an update direction ∆f which is applied to the current estimate: f k+1 = ∆f + f k+1 .</p><p>The update operator takes flow, correlation, and a latent hidden state as input, and outputs the update ∆f and an updated hidden state. The architecture of our update operator is designed to mimic the steps of an optimization algorithm. As such, we used tied weights across depth and use bounded activations to encourage convergence to a fixed point. The update operator is trained to perform updates such that the sequence converges to a fixed point f k → f * .</p><p>Initialization: By default, we initialize the flow field to 0 everywhere, but our iterative approach gives us the flexibility to experiment with alternatives. When applied to video, we test warm-start initialization, where optical flow from the previous pair of frames is forward projected to the next pair of frames with occlusion gaps filled in using nearest neighbor interpolation. Inputs: Given the current flow estimate f k , we use it to retrieve correlation features from the correlation pyramid as described in Sec. 3.2. The correlation features are then processed by 2 convolutional layers. Additionally, we apply 2 convolutional layers to the flow estimate itself to generate flow features. Finally, we directly inject the input from the context network. The input feature map is then taken as the concatenation of the correlation, flow, and context features. Update: A core component of the update operator is a gated activation unit based on the GRU cell, with fully connected layers replaced with convolutions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">z t = σ(Conv 3x3 ([h t−1 , x t ], W z ))<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">r t = σ(Conv 3x3 ([h t−1 , x t ], W r )) (4) h t = tanh(Conv 3x3 ([r t h t−1 , x t ], W h )) (5) h t = (1 − z t ) h t−1 + z t h t<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where x t is the concatenation of flow, correlation, and context features previously defined. We also experiment with a separable ConvGRU unit, where we replace the 3 × 3 convolution with two GRUs: one with a 1 × 5 convolution and one with a 5 × 1 convolution to increase the receptive field without significantly increasing the size of the model. Flow Prediction: The hidden state outputted by the GRU is passed through two convolutional layers to predict the flow update ∆f . The output flow is at 1/8 resolution of the input image. During training and evaluation, we upsample the predicted flow fields to match the resolution of the ground truth. Upsampling: The network outputs optical flow at 1/8 resolution. We upsample the optical flow to full resolution by taking the full resolution flow at each pixel to be the convex combination of a 3x3 grid of its coarse resolution neighbors. We use two convolutional layers to predict a H/8×W/8×(8×8×9) mask and perform softmax over the weights of the 9 neighbors. The final high resolution flow field is found by using the mask to take a weighted combination over the neighborhood, then permuting and reshaping to a H × W × 2 dimensional flow field. This layer can be directly implemented in PyTorch using the unfold function.</p></div>

Unless otherwise noted, we evaluate after 32 flow updates on Sintel and 24 on KITTI. For every update, ∆f + f k , we only backpropgate the gradient through the ∆f branch, and zero the gradient through the f k branch as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Training Schedule: We train RAFT using two 2080Ti GPUs. We pretrain on FlyingThings for 100k iterations with a batch size of 12, then train for 100k iterations on FlyingThings3D with a batch size of 6. We finetune on Sintel for another 100k by combining data from Sintel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, KITTI-2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and HD1K <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> similar to MaskFlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and PWC-Net+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Finally, we finetune on KITTI-2015 for an additionally 50k iterations using the weights from the model finetuned on Sintel. Details on training and data augmentation are provided in the supplemental material. For comparison with prior work, we also include results from our model when finetuning only on Sintel and only on KITTI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Sintel</head><p>We train our model using the FlyingChairs→FlyingThings schedule and then evaluate on the Sintel dataset using the train split for validation. Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, and we split results based on the data used for training. C + T means that the models are trained on FlyingChairs(C) and FlyingThings(T), while +ft indicates the model is finetuned on Sintel data. Like PWC-Net+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and MaskFlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> we include data from KITTI and HD1K when finetuning. We train 3 times with different seeds, and report results using the model with the median accuracy on the clean pass of Sintel (train). When using C+T for training, our method outperforms all existing approaches, despite using a significantly shorter training schedule. Our method achieves an average EPE (end-point-error) of 1.43 on the Sintel(train) clean pass, which is a 29% lower error than FlowNet2. These results demonstrates good cross dataset generalization. One of the reasons for better generalization is the structure of our network. By constraining optical flow to be the product of a series of identical update steps, we force the network to learn an update operator which mimics the updates of a first-order descent algorithm. This constrains the search space, reduces the risk of over-fitting, and leads to faster training and better generalization.</p><p>When evaluating on the Sintel(test) set, we finetune on the combined clean and final passes of the training set along with KITTI and HD1K data. Our method ranks 1st on both the Sintel clean and final passes, and outperforms all prior work by 0.9 pixels (36%) on the clean pass and 1.2 pixels (30%) on the final pass. We evaluate two versions of our model, Ours (two-frame) uses zero initialization, while Ours (warp-start) initializes flow by forward projecting the flow estimate from the previous frame. Since our method operates at a single resolution, we can initialize the flow estimate to utilize motion smoothness from past frames, which cannot be easily done using the coarse-to-fine model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">KITTI</head><p>We also evaluate RAFT on KITTI and provide results in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  4</ref>. We first evaluate cross-dataset generalization by evaluating on the KITTI-15 (train) split after training on Chairs(C) and FlyingThings(T). Our method outperforms prior works by a large margin, improving EPE (end-point-error) from 8.36 to 5.04, which shows that the underlying structure of our network facilitates generalization. Our method ranks 1st on the KITTI leaderboard among all optical flow methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablations</head><p>We perform a set of ablation experiments to show the relative importance of each component. All ablated versions are trained on FlyingChairs(C) + Fly-ingThings(T). Results of the ablations are shown in We use a gated activation unit based on the GRU cell. We experiment with replacing the convolutional GRU with a set of 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation. We achieve better performance by using the GRU block, likely because the gated activation makes it easier for the sequence of flow estimates to converge.</p><p>Weight Tying: By default, we tied the weights across all instances of the update operator. Here, we test a version of our approach where each update operator learns a separate set of weights. Accuracy is better when weights are tied and the parameter count is significantly lower.  Context: We test the importance of context by training a model with the context network removed. Without context, we still achieve good results, outperforming all existing works on both Sintel and KITTI. But context is helpful. Directly injecting image features into the update operator likely allows spatial information to be better aggregated within motion boundaries.</p><p>Feature Scale: By default, we extract features at a single resolution. We also try extracting features at multiple resolutions by building a correlation volume at each scale separately. Single resolution features simplifies the network architecture and allows fine-grained matching even at large displacements.</p><p>Lookup Radius: The lookup radius specifies the dimensions of the grid used in the lookup operation. When a radius of 0 is used, the correlation volume is retrieved at a single point. Surprisingly, we can still get a rough estimate of flow when the radius is 0, which means the network is learning to use 0'th order information. However, we see better results as the radius is increased.</p><p>Correlation Pooling: We output features at a single resolution and then perform pooling to generate multiscale volumes. Here we test the impact when this pooling is removed. Results are better with pooling, because large and small displacements are both captured.</p><p>Correlation Range: Instead of all-pairs correlation, we also try constructing the correlation volume only for a local neighborhood around each pixel. We try a range of 32 pixels, 64 pixels, and 128 pixels. Overall we get the best results when the all-pairs are used, although a 128px range is sufficient to perform well on Sintel because most displacements fall within this range. That said, all-pairs is still preferable because it eliminates the need to specify a range. It is also more convenient to implement: it can be computed using matrix multiplication allowing our approach to be implemented entirely in PyTorch.</p><p>Features for Refinement: We compute visual similarity by building a correlation volume between all pairs of pixels. In this experiment, we try replacing the correlation volume with a warping layer, which uses the current estimate of optical flow to warp features from I 2 onto I 1 and then estimates the residual displacement. While warping is still competitive with prior work on Sintel, correlation performs significantly better, especially on KITTI.</p><p>Upsampling: RAFT outputs flow fields at 1/8 resolution. We compare bilinear upsampling to our learned upsampling module. The upsampling module produces better results, particularly near motion boundaries.</p><p>Inference Updates: Although we unroll 12 updates during training, we can apply an arbitrary number of updates during inference. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> we provide numerical results for selected number of updates, and test an extreme case of 200 to show that our method doesn't diverge. Our method quickly converges, surpassing PWC-Net after 3 updates and FlowNet2 after 6 updates, but continues to improve with more updates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Timing and Parameter Counts</head><p>Inference time and parameter counts are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Accuracy is determined by performance on the Sintel(train) final pass after training on Fly-ingChairs and FlyingThings (C+T). In these plots, we report accuracy and timing after 10 iterations, and we time our method using a GTX 1080Ti GPU. Parameters counts for other methods are taken as reported in their papers, and we report times when run on our hardware. RAFT is more efficient in terms of parameter count, inference time, and training iterations. Ours-S uses only 1M parameters, but outperforms PWC-Net and VCN which are more than 6x larger. We provide an additional table with numerical values for parameters, timing, and training iterations in the supplemental material.   </p></div>

We use 1080p (1088x1920) resolution video and apply 12 iterations of our approach. Inference takes 550ms for 12 iterations on 1080p video, with all-pairs correlation taking 95ms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> visualizes example results on DAVIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have proposed RAFT-Recurrent All-Pairs Field B Upsampling Module <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>: Illistration of the upsampling module. Each pixel of the high resolution flow field (small boxes) is taken to be the convex combination of its 9 coarse resolution neighbors using weights predicted by the network.   Photometric Augmentation: We perform photometric augmentation by randomly perturbing brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue. We use the Torchvision ColorJitter with brightness 0.4, contrast 0.4, saturation 0.4, and hue 0.5/π. On KITTI, we reduce the degree of augmentation to brightness 0.3, contrast 0.3, saturation 0.3, and hue 0.3/π. With probablity 0.2, color augmentation is performed to each of the images independently. Spatial Augmentation: We perform spatial augmentation by randomly rescaling and stretching the images. The degree of random scaling depends on the dataset. For FlyingChairs, we perform spatial augmentation in the range 2 <ref type="bibr">[</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Parameter counts, inference time, training iterations, and accuracy on the Sintel (train) final pass. We report the timing and accuracy of our method after 10 updates using a GTX 1080Ti GPU. If possible, we download the code from the other methods and re-time using our machine. If the model is trained using more than one GPU, we report the number of GPUs used to train in parenthesis. We can also train RAFT using mixed precision training Ours(mixed) and achieve similar results while training on only a single GPU. Overall, RAFT requires fewer training iterations and parameters when compared to prior work.</p></div>

Network architecture details for the full 4.8M parameter model (5.3M with upsampling module) and the small 1.0M parameter model. The context and feature encoders have the same architecture, the only difference is that the feature encoder uses instance normalization while the context encoder uses batch normalization. In RAFT-S, we replace the residual units with bottleneck residual units. The update block takes in context features, correlation features, and flow features to update the latent hidden state. The updated hidden status is used to predict the flow update.
