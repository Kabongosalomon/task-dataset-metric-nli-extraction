<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The embodiment hypothesis is the idea that intelligence emerges in the interaction of an agent with an environment and as a result of sensorimotor activity.</p><p>Smith and Gasser <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> Imagine walking up to a home robot and asking 'Heycan you go check if my laptop is on my desk? And if so, bring it to me.' In order to be successful, such a robot would need a range of skills -visual perception (to recognize scenes and objects), language understanding (to translate questions and instructions into actions), and navigation in complex environments (to move and find things in a changing environment).</p><p>While there has been significant progress in the vision and language communities thanks to recent advances in deep representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, much of this progress has been on 'internet AI' rather than embodied AI. The focus of the former is pattern recognition in images, videos, and text on datasets typically curated from the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. The focus of the latter is to enable action by an embodied agent (e.g. a robot) in an environment. This brings to the fore active perception, long-term planning, learning from interaction, and holding a dialog grounded in an environment.</p><p>A straightforward proposal is to train agents directly in the physical world -exposing them to all its richness. This is valuable and will continue to play an important role in the development of AI. However, we also recognize that training robots in the real world is slow (the real world runs no faster than real time and cannot be parallelized), dangerous (poorly-trained agents can unwittingly injure themselves, the environment, or others), resource intensive (the robot(s) and the environment(s) in which they execute demand resources and time), difficult to control (it is hard to test corner-case scenarios as these are, by definition, infrequent and challenging to recreate), and not easily reproducible (replicating conditions across experiments and institutions is difficult).</p><p>We aim to support a complementary research program:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> datasets providing 3D assets with semantic annotations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> simulators that render these assets and within which an embodied agent may be simulated, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> tasks that define evaluatable problems that enable us to benchmark scientific progress. Prior work (highlighted in blue boxes) has contributed a variety of datasets, simulation software, and task definitions. We propose a unified embodied agent stack with the Habitat platform, including generic dataset support, a highly performant simulator (Habitat-Sim), and a flexible API (Habitat-API) allowing the definition and evaluation of a broad set of tasks.</p><p>training embodied agents (e.g. virtual robots) in rich realistic simulators and then transferring the learned skills to reality. Simulations have a long and rich history in science and engineering (from aerospace to zoology). In the context of embodied AI, simulators help overcome the aforementioned challenges -they can run orders of magnitude faster than real-time and can be parallelized over a cluster; training in simulation is safe, cheap, and enables fair comparison and benchmarking of progress in a concerted communitywide effort. Once a promising approach has been developed and tested in simulation, it can be transferred to physical platforms that operate in the real world <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>Datasets have been a key driver of progress in computer vision, NLP, and other areas of AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. As the community transitions to embodied AI, we believe that simulators will assume the role played previously by datasets. To support this transition, we aim to standardize the entire 'software stack' for training embodied agents ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>): scanning the world and creating photorealistic 3D assets, developing the next generation of highly efficient and parallelizable simulators, specifying embodied AI tasks that enable us to benchmark scientific progress, and releasing modular high-level libraries for training and deploying embodied agents. Specifically, Habitat consists of the following:</p><p>1. Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, multiple sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling (with built-in support for Mat-terport3D, Gibson, and Replica datasets).</p><p>2. Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for endto-end development of embodied AI algorithms -defining embodied AI tasks (e.g. navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring and training embodied agents (via imitation or reinforcement learning, or via classic SLAM), and benchmarking using standard metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The Habitat architecture and implementation combine modularity and high performance. When rendering a scene from the Matterport3D dataset, Habitat-Sim achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running singlethreaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU, which is orders of magnitude faster than the closest simulator. Habitat-API allows us to train and benchmark embodied agents with different classes of methods and in different 3D scene datasets.</p><p>These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we make two scientific contributions:</p><p>1. We revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations.</p><p>2. We conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} Ã— {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {Blind 1 , RGB, RGBD, D} Ã— {GPS+Compass} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize well across datasets.</p><p>We hope that our open-source platform and these findings will advance and guide future research in embodied AI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liza Minnelli</head><p>The availability of large-scale 3D scene datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and community interest in active vision tasks led to a recent surge of work that resulted in the development of a variety of simulation platforms for indoor environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. These platforms vary with respect to the 3D scene data they use, the embodied agent tasks they address, and the evaluation protocols they implement.</p><p>This surge of activity is both thrilling and alarming. On the one hand, it is clearly a sign of the interest in embodied AI across diverse research communities (computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, machine learning). On the other hand, the existence of multiple differing simulation environments can cause fragmentation, replication of effort, and difficulty in reproduction and community-wide progress. Moreover, existing simulators exhibit several shortcomings: -Tight coupling of task (e.g. navigation), simulation platform (e.g. GibsonEnv), and 3D dataset (e.g. Gibson). Experiments with multiple tasks or datasets are impractical. -Hard-coded agent configuration (e.g. size, action-space).</p><p>Ablations of agent parameters and sensor types are not supported, making results hard to compare. -Suboptimal rendering and simulation performance. Most existing indoor simulators operate at relatively low frame rates (10-100 fps), becoming a bottleneck in training agents and making large-scale learning infeasible. Takeaway messages from such experiments become unreliable -has the learning converged to trust the comparisons? -Limited control of environment state. The structure of the 3D scene in terms of present objects cannot be programmatically modified (e.g. to test the robustness of agents). Most critically, work built on top of any of the existing platforms is hard to reproduce independently from the platform, and thus hard to evaluate against work based on a different platform, even in cases where the target tasks and datasets are the same. This status quo is undesirable and motivates the Habitat effort. We aim to learn from the successes of previous frameworks and develop a unifying platform that combines their desirable characteristics while addressing their limitations. A common, unifying platform can significantly accelerate research by enabling code re-use and consistent experimental methodology. Moreover, a common platform enables us to easily carry out experiments testing agents based on different paradigms (learned vs. classical) and generalization of agents between datasets.</p><p>The experiments we carry out contrasting learned and classical approaches to navigation are similar to the recent work of Mishkin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, the performance of the Habitat stack relative to MINOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Figure 2: Example rendered sensor observations for three sensors (color camera, depth sensor, semantic instance mask) in two different environment datasets. A Matterport3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> environment is in the top row, and a Replica <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> environment in the bottom row.</p><p>-thousands vs. one hundred frames per second -allows us to evaluate agents that have been trained with significantly larger amounts of experience (75 million steps vs. five million steps). The trends we observe demonstrate that learned agents can begin to match and outperform classical approaches when provided with large amounts of training experience. Other recent work by Koijima and Deng <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has also compared hand-engineered navigation agents against learned agents but their focus is on defining additional metrics to characterize the performance of agents and to establish measures of hardness for navigation episodes. To our knowledge, our experiments are the first to train navigation agents provided with multi-month experience in realistic indoor environments and contrast them against classical methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Richard Feynman</head><p>The development of Habitat is a long-term effort to enable the formation of a common task framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for research into embodied agents, thereby supporting systematic research progress in this area. Design requirements. The issues discussed in the previous section lead us to a set of requirements that we seek to fulfill.</p><p>-Highly performant rendering engine: resourceefficient rendering engine that can produce multiple channels of visual information (e.g. RGB, depth, semantic instance segmentation, surface normals, optical flow) for multiple concurrently operating agents. -Scene dataset ingestion API: makes the platform agnostic to 3D scene datasets and allows users to use their own datasets. -Agent API: allows users to specify parameterized embodied agents with well-defined geometry, physics, and actuation characteristics.</p><p>-Sensor suite API: allows specification of arbitrary numbers of parameterized sensors (e.g. RGB, depth, contact, GPS, compass sensors) attached to each agent. -Scenario and task API: allows portable definition of tasks and their evaluation protocols. -Implementation: C++ backend with Python API and interoperation with common learning frameworks, minimizes entry threshold. -Containerization: enables distributed training in clusters and remote-server evaluation of user-provided code. -Humans-as-agents: allows humans to function as agents in simulation in order to collect human behavior and investigate human-agent or human-human interactions. -Environment state manipulation: programmatic control of the environment configuration in terms of the objects that are present and their relative layout. Design overview. The above design requirements cut across several layers in the 'software stack' in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. A monolithic design is not suitable for addressing requirements at all levels. We, therefore, structure the Habitat platform to mirror this multi-layer abstraction.</p><p>At the lowest level is Habitat-Sim, a flexible, highperformance 3D simulator, responsible for loading 3D scenes into a standardized scene-graph representation, configuring agents with multiple sensors, simulating agent motion, and returning sensory data from an agent's sensor suite. The sensor abstraction in Habitat allows additional sensors such as LIDAR and IMU to be easily implemented as plugins. Generic 3D dataset API using scene graphs. Habitat-Sim employs a hierarchical scene graph to represent all supported 3D environment datasets, whether synthetic or based on real-world reconstructions. The use of a uniform scene graph representation allows us to abstract the details of specific datasets, and to treat them in a consistent fashion. Scene graphs allow us to compose 3D environments through procedural scene generation, editing, or programmatic manipulation. Rendering engine. The Habitat-Sim backend module is implemented in C++ and leverages the Magnum graphics middleware library 2 to support cross-platform deployment on a broad variety of hardware configurations. The simulator backend employs an efficient rendering pipeline that implements visual sensor frame rendering using a multiattachment 'uber-shader' combining outputs for color camera sensors, depth sensors, and semantic mask sensors. By allowing all outputs to be produced in a single render pass, we avoid additional overhead when sensor parameters are shared and the same render pass can be used for all outputs. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows examples of visual sensors rendered in three different supported datasets. The same agent and sensor configuration was instantiated in a scene from each of the  three datasets by simply specifying a different input scene.</p><p>Performance. Habitat-Sim achieves thousands of frames per second per simulator thread and is orders of magnitude faster than previous simulators for realistic indoor environments (which typically operate at tens or hundreds of frames per second) -see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> for a summary and the supplement for more details. By comparison, AI2-THOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and CHALET <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> run at tens of fps, MINOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> run at about a hundred, and House3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> runs at about 300 fps. Habitat-Sim is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. By operating at 10,000 frames per second we shift the bottleneck from simulation to optimization for network training. Based on TensorFlow benchmarks, many popular network architectures run at frame rates that are 10-100x lower on a single GPU <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . In practice, we have observed that it is often faster to generate images using Habitat-Sim than to load images from disk. Efficient GPU throughput. Currently, frames rendered by Habitat-Sim are exposed as Python tensors through shared memory. Future development will focus on even higher rendering efficiency by entirely avoiding GPU-to-CPU memory copy overhead through the use of CUDA-GL interoperation and direct sharing of render buffers and textures as tensors. Our preliminary internal testing suggests that this can lead to a speedup by a factor of 2.</p><p>Above the simulation backend, the Habitat-API layer is a modular high-level library for end-to-end development in embodied AI. Setting up an embodied task involves specifying observations that may be used by the agent(s), using environment information provided by the simulator, and connecting the information with a task-specific episode dataset.</p><p>-Task:</p><p>this class extends the simulator's Observations class and action space with taskspecific ones. The criteria of episode termination and measures of success are provided by the Task. For example, in goal-driven navigation, Task provides the goal and evaluation metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. To support this kind of functionality the Task has read-only access to Simulator and Episode-Dataset.</p><p>-Episode: a class for episode specification that includes the initial position and orientation of an Agent, scene id, goal position, and optionally the shortest path to the goal. An episode is a description of an instance of the task. -Environment: the fundamental environment concept for Habitat, abstracting all the information needed for working on embodied tasks with a simulator. More details about the architecture of the Habitat platform, performance measurements, and examples of API use are provided in the supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">PointGoal Navigation at Scale</head><p>To demonstrate the utility of the Habitat platform design, we carry out experiments to test for generalization of goal-directed visual navigation agents between datasets of different environments and to compare the performance of learning-based agents against classic agents as the amount of available training experience is increased.</p><p>Task definition. We use the PointGoal task (as defined by Anderson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) as our experimental testbed. This task is ostensibly simple to define -an agent is initialized at a random starting position and orientation in an environment and asked to navigate to target coordinates that are provided relative to the agent's position; no ground-truth map is available and the agent must only use its sensory input to navigate. However, in the course of experiments, we realized that this task leaves space for subtle choices that (a) can make a significant difference in experimental outcomes and (b) are either not specified or inconsistent across papers, making comparison difficult. We attempt to be as descriptive as possible about these seemingly low-level choices; we hope the Habitat platform will help iron out these inconsistencies.</p><p>Agent embodiment and action space. The agent is physically embodied as a cylindrical primitive shape with diameter 0.2m and height 1.5m. The action space consists of four actions: turn_left, turn_right, move_forward, and stop. These actions are mapped to idealized actuations that result in 10 degree turns for the turning actions and linear displacement of 0.25m for the move_forward action. The stop action allows the agent to signal that it has reached the goal. Habitat supports noisy actuations but experiments in this paper are conducted in the noise-free setting as our analysis focuses on other factors.</p><p>Collision dynamics. Some previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> use a coarse irregular navigation graph where an agent effectively 'teleports' from one location to another (1-2m apart). Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> use a fine-grained regular grid (0.01m resolution) where the agent moves on unoccupied cells and there are no collisions or partial steps. In Habitat and our experiments, we use a more realistic collision model -the agent navigates in a continuous state space <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and motion can produce collisions resulting in partial (or no) progress along the direction intended -simply put, it is possible for the agent to 'slide' along a wall or obstacle. Crucially, the agent may choose move_forward (0.25m) and end up in a location that is not 0.25m forward of where it started; thus, odometry is not trivial even in the absence of actuation noise. Goal specification: static or dynamic? One conspicuous underspecification in the PointGoal task <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is whether the goal coordinates are static (i.e. provided once at the start of the episode) or dynamic (i.e. provided at every time step). The former is more realistic -it is difficult to imagine a real task where an oracle would provide precise dynamic goal coordinates. However, in the absence of actuation noise and collisions, every step taken by the agent results in a known turn or translation, and this combined with the initial goal location is functionally equivalent to dynamic goal specification. We hypothesize that this is why recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> used dynamic goal specification. We follow and prescribe the following conceptual delineation -as a task, we adopt static PointGoal navigation; as for the sensor suite, we equip our agents with an idealized GPS+Compass sensor. This orients us towards a realistic task (static PointGoal navigation), disentangles simulator design (actuation noise, collision dynamics) from the task definition, and allows us to compare techniques by sensors used (RGB, depth, GPS, compass, contact sensors). Sensory input. The agents are endowed with a single color vision sensor placed at a height of 1.5m from the center of the agent's base and oriented to face 'forward'. This sensor provides RGB frames at a resolution of 256 2 pixels and with a field of view of 90 degrees. In addition, an idealized depth sensor is available, in the same position and orientation as the color vision sensor. The field of view and resolution of the depth sensor match those of the color vision sensor. We designate agents that make use of the color sensor by RGB, agents that make use of the depth sensor by Depth, and agents that make use of both by RGBD. Agents that use neither sensor are denoted as Blind. All agents are equipped with an idealized GPS and compass -i.e., they have access to their location coordinates, and implicitly their orientation relative to the goal position. Episode specification. We initialize the agent at a starting position and orientation that are sampled uniformly at random from all navigable positions on the floor of the environment. The goal position is chosen such that it lies on the same floor and there exists a navigable path from the agent's starting position. During the episode, the agent is allowed to take up to 500 actions. This threshold significantly exceeds the number of steps an optimal agent requires to reach all goals (see the supplement). After each action, the agent receives a set of observations from the active sensors. Evaluation. A navigation episode is considered successful if and only if the agent issues a stop action within 0.2m of the target coordinates, as measured by a geodesic distance along the shortest path from the agent's position to the goal position. If the agent takes 500 actions without the above condition being met the episode ends and is considered unsuccessful. Performance is measured using the 'Success weighted by Path Length' (SPL) metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For an episode where the geodesic distance of the shortest path is l and the agent traverses a distance p, SPL is defined as S Â· l /max(p,l), where S is a binary indicator of success. Episode dataset preparation. We create PointGoal navigation episode-datasets for Matterport3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> scenes. For Matterport3D we followed the publicly available train/val/test splits. Note that as in recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, there is no overlap between train, val, and test scenes. For Gibson scenes, we obtained textured 3D surface meshes from the Gibson authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, manually annotated each scene on its reconstruction quality (small/big holes, floating/irregular surfaces, poor textures), and curated a subset of 106 scenes (out of 572); see the supplement for details. An episode is defined by the unique id of the scene, the starting position and orientation of the agent, and the goal position. Additional metadata such as the geodesic distance along the shortest path (GDSP) from start position to goal position is also included. While generating episodes, we restrict the GDSP to be between 1m and 30m. An episode is trivial if there is an obstacle-free straight line between the start and goal positions. A good measure of the navigation complexity of an episode is the ratio of GDSP to Euclidean distance between start and goal positions (notice that GDSP can only be larger than or equal to the Euclidean distance). If the ratio is nearly 1, there are few obstacles and the episode is easy; if the ratio is much larger than 1, the episode is difficult because strategic navigation is required. To keep the navigation complexity of the precomputed episodes reasonably high, we perform rejection sampling for episodes with the above ratio falling in the range [1, 1.1]. Following this, there is a significant decrease in the number of near-straight-line episodes (episodes with a ratio in [1, 1.1]) -from 37% to 10% for the Gibson dataset generation. This step was not performed in any previous studies. We find that without this filtering, all metrics appear inflated. Gibson scenes have smaller physical dimensions compared to the Matterport3D scenes. This is reflected in the resulting PointGoal datasetaverage GDSP of episodes in Gibson scenes is smaller than that of Matterport3D scenes. Baselines. We compare the following baselines: -Random chooses an action randomly among turn_left, turn_right, and move_forward with uniform distribution. The agent calls the stop action when within 0.2m of the goal (computed using the difference of static goal and dynamic GPS coordinates). -Forward only always calls the move_forward action, and calls the stop action when within 0.2m of the goal. -Goal follower moves towards the goal direction. If it is not facing the goal (more than 15 degrees off-axis), it performs turn_left or turn_right to align itself; otherwise, it calls move_forward. The agent calls the stop action when within 0.2m of the goal. -RL (PPO) is an agent trained with reinforcement learning, specifically proximal policy optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We experiment with RL agents equipped with different visual sensors: no visual input (Blind), RGB input, Depth input, and RGB with depth (RGBD). The model consists of a CNN that produces an embedding for visual input, which together with the relative goal vector is used by an actor (GRU) and a critic (linear layer). The CNN has the following architecture: {Conv 8Ã—8, ReLU, Conv 4Ã—4, ReLU, Conv 3Ã—3, ReLU, Linear, ReLU} (see supplement for details). Let r t denote the reward at timestep t, d t be the geodesic distance to goal at timestep t, s a success reward and Î» a time penalty (to encourage efficiency). All models were trained with the following reward function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r t = s + d tâˆ’1 âˆ’ d t + Î» if goal is reached d tâˆ’1 âˆ’ d t + Î» otherwise</formula><p>In our experiments s is set to 10 and Î» is set to âˆ’0.01. Note that rewards are only provided in training environments; the task is challenging as the agent must generalize to unseen test environments. -SLAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is an agent implementing a classic robotics navigation pipeline (including components for localization, mapping, and planning), using RGB and depth sensors. We use the classic agent by Mishkin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which leverages the ORB-SLAM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> localization pipeline, with the same parameters as reported in the original work.</p><p>Training procedure. When training learning-based agents, we first divide the scenes in the training set equally among 8 (Gibson), 6 (Matterport3D) concurrently running simulator worker threads. Each thread establishes blocks of 500 training episodes for each scene in its training set partition and shuffles the ordering of these blocks. Training continues through shuffled copies of this array. We do not hardcode the stop action to retain generality and allow for comparison with future work that does not assume GPS inputs. For the experiments reported here, we train until 75 million agent steps are accumulated across all worker threads. This is 15x larger than the experience used in previous investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Training agents to 75 million steps took (in sum over all three datasets): 320 GPU-hours for Blind, 566 GPU-hours for RGB, 475 GPU-hours for Depth, and 906 GPU-hours for RGBD (overall 2267 GPU-hours). 0.51 0.62 0.39 0.47 <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Performance of baseline methods on the PointGoal task <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> tested on the Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and MP3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> test sets under multiple sensor configurations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Findings</head><p>We seek to answer two questions: i) how do learningbased agents compare to classic SLAM and hand-coded baselines as the amount of training experience increases and ii) how well do learned agents generalize across 3D datasets.</p><p>It should be tacitly understood, but to be explicit -'learning' and 'SLAM' are broad families of techniques (and not a single method), are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and are not 'settled' in their development. We compare representative instances of these families to gain insight into questions of scaling and generalization, and do not make any claims about intrinsic superiority of one or the other. Learning vs SLAM. To answer the first question we plot agent performance (SPL) on validation (i.e. unseen) episodes over the course of training in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> (top: Gibson, bottom: Matterport3D). SLAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> does not require training and thus has a constant performance (0.59 on Gibson, 0.42 on Matterport3D). All RL (PPO) agents start out with far worse SPL, but RL (PPO) Depth, in particular, improves dramatically and matches the classic baseline at approximately 10M frames (Gibson) or 30M frames (Matterport3D) of experience, continuing to improve thereafter. Notice that if we terminated the experiment at 5M frames as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we would also conclude that SLAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> dominates. Interestingly, RGB agents do not significantly outperform Blind agents; we hypothesize because both are equipped with GPS sensors. Indeed, qualitative results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4</ref> and video in supplement) suggest that Blind agents 'hug' walls and implement 'wall following' heuristics. In contrast, RGB sensors provide a high-dimensional complex signal that may be prone to overfitting to train environments due to the variety across scenes (even within the same dataset). We also notice in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> that all methods perform better on Gibson than Matterport3D. This is consistent with our previous analysis that Gibson contains smaller scenes and shorter episodes.</p><p>Next, for each agent and dataset, we select the bestperforming checkpoint on validation and report results on test in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We observe that uniformly across the datasets, RL (PPO) Depth performs best, outperforming RL (PPO) RGBD (by 0.09-0.16 SPL), SLAM (by 0.15-0.28 SPL), and RGB (by 0.13-0.33 SPL) in that order (see the supplement for additional experiments involving noisy depth). We believe Depth performs better than RGBD because i) the PointGoal navigation task requires reasoning only about free space and depth provides relevant information directly, and ii) RGB has significantly more entropy (different houses look very different), thus it is easier to overfit when using RGB. We ran our experiments with 5 random seeds per run, to confirm that these differences are statistically significant. The differences are about an order of magnitude larger than the standard deviation of average SPL for all cases (e.g. on the Gibson dataset errors are, Depth: Â±0.015, RGB: Â±0.055, RGBD: Â±0.028, Blind: Â±0.005). Random and forward-only agents have   <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Generalization of agents between datasets. We report average SPL for a model trained on the source dataset in each row, as evaluated on test episodes for the target dataset in each column. very low performance, while the hand-coded goal follower and Blind baseline see modest performance.See the supplement for additional analysis of trained agent behavior.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> we plot example trajectories for the RL (PPO) agents, to qualitatively contrast their behavior in the same episode. Consistent with the aggregate statistics, we observe that Blind collides with obstacles and follows walls, while Depth is the most efficient. See the supplement and the video for more example trajectories. Generalization across datasets. Our findings so far are that RL (PPO) agents significantly outperform SLAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This prompts our second question -are these findings dataset specific or do learned agents generalize across datasets? We report exhaustive comparisons in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> -specifically, average SPL for all combinations of {train, test} Ã— {Matterport3D, Gibson} for all agents {Blind, RGB, RGBD, Depth }. Rows indicate (agent, train set) pair, columns indicate test set. We find a number of interesting trends. First, nearly all agents suffer a drop in performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another, e.g. RGBD Gibsonâ†’Gibson 0.70 vs RGBD Gibsonâ†’Matterport3D 0.53 (drop of 0.17). RGB and RGBD agents suffer a significant performance degradation, while the Blind agent is least affected (as we would expect).</p><p>Second, we find a potentially counter-intuitive trendagents trained on Gibson consistently outperform their counterparts trained on Matterport3D, even when evaluated on Matterport3D. We believe the reason is the previously noted observation that Gibson scenes are smaller and episodes are shorter (lower GDSP) than Matterport3D. Gibson agents are trained on 'easier' episodes and encounter positive reward more easily during random exploration, thus bootstrapping learning. Consequently, for a fixed computation budget Gibson agents are stronger universally (not just on Gibson). This finding suggests that visual navigation agents could benefit from curriculum learning.</p><p>These insights are enabled by the engineering of Habitat, which made these experiments as simple as a change in the evaluation dataset name.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke</head><p>Challenges drive progress. The history of AI sub-fields indicates that the formulation of the right questions, the creation of the right datasets, and the coalescence of communities around the right challenges drives scientific progress. Our goal is to support this process for embodied AI. Habitat Challenge is an autonomous navigation challenge that aims to benchmark and advance efforts in goal-directed visual navigation.</p><p>One difficulty in creating a challenge around embodied AI tasks is the transition from static predictions (as in passive perception) to sequential decision making (as in sensorimotor control). In traditional 'internet AI' challenges (e.g. ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, VQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>), it is possible to release a static testing dataset and ask participants to simply upload their predictions on this set. In contrast, embodied AI tasks typically involve sequential decision making and agentdriven control, making it infeasible to pre-package a testing dataset. Essentially, embodied AI challenges require participants to upload code not predictions. The uploaded agents can then be evaluated in novel (unseen) test environments. Challenge infrastructure. We leverage the frontend and challenge submission process of the EvalAI platform, and build backend infrastructure ourselves. Participants in Habitat Challenge are asked to upload Docker containers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with their agents via EvalAI. The submitted agents are then evaluated on a live AWS GPU-enabled instance. Specifically, contestants are free to train their agents however they wish (any language, any framework, any infrastructure). In order to evaluate these agents, participants are asked to derive from a base Habitat Docker container and implement a spe-cific interface to their model -agent's action taken given an observation from the environment at each step. This dockerized interface enables running the participant code on new environments.</p><p>More details regarding the Habitat Challenge held at CVPR 2019 are available at the https://aihabitat. org/challenge/ website. In a future iteration of this challenge we will introduce three major differences designed to both reduce the gap between simulation and reality and to increase the difficulty of the task. -In the 2019 challenge, the relative coordinates specifying the goal were continuously updated during agent movement -essentially simulating an agent with perfect localization and heading estimation (e.g. an agent with an idealized GPS+Compass). However, high-precision localization in indoor environments can not be assumed in realistic settings -GPS has low precision indoors, (visual) odometry may be noisy, SLAM-based localization can fail, etc. Hence, we will investiage only providing to the agent a fixed relative coordinate for the goal position from the start location.</p><p>-Likewise, the 2019 Habitat Challenge modeled agent actions (e.g. forward, turn 10 â€¢ left,...) deterministically. However in real settings, agent intention (e.g. go forward 1m) and the result rarely match perfectly -actuation error, differing surface materials, and a myriad of other sources of error introduce significant drift over a long trajectory. To model this, we introduce a noise model acquired by benchmarking a real robotic platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Visual sensing is an excellent means of combating this "dead-reckoning" drift and this change allows participants to study methodologies that are robust to and can correct for this noise.</p><p>-Finally, we will introduce realistic models of sensor noise for RGB and depth sensors -narrowing the gap between perceptual experiences agents would have in simulation and reality. We look forward to supporting the community in establishing a benchmark to evaluate the state-of-the-art in methods for embodied navigation agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Future Work</head><p>We described the design and implementation of the Habitat platform. Our goal is to unify existing community efforts and to accelerate research into embodied AI. This is a longterm effort that will succeed only by full engagement of the broader research community.</p><p>Experiments enabled by the generic dataset support and the high performance of the Habitat stack indicate that i) learning-based agents can match and exceed the performance of classic visual navigation methods when trained for long enough and ii) learned agents equipped with depth sensors generalize well between different 3D environment datasets in comparison to agents equipped with only RGB. Feature roadmap. Our near-term development roadmap will focus on incorporating physics simulation and enabling physics-based interaction between mobile agents and objects in 3D environments. Habitat-Sim's scene graph representation is well-suited for integration with physics engines, allowing us to directly control the state of individual objects and agents within a scene graph. Another planned avenue of future work involves procedural generation of 3D environments by leveraging a combination of 3D reconstruction and virtual object datasets. By combining high-quality reconstructions of large indoor spaces with separately reconstructed or modelled objects, we can take full advantage of our hierarchical scene graph representation to introduce controlled variation in the simulated 3D environments.</p><p>Lastly, we plan to focus on distributed simulation settings that involve large numbers of agents potentially interacting with one another in competitive or collaborative scenarios. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Additional Experimental Results</head><p>In order to confirm that the trends we observe for the experimental results presented in the paper hold for much larger amounts of experience, we scaled our experiments to 800M steps. We found that (1) the ordering of the visual inputs stays Depth &gt; RGBD &gt; RGB &gt; Blind; (2) RGB is consistently better than Blind (by 0.06/0.03 SPL on Gibson/Matterport3D), and (3) RGBD outperforms SLAM on Matterport3D (by 0.16 SPL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1. Analysis of Collisions</head><p>To further characterize the behavior of learned agents during navigation we plot the average number of collisions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. We see that Blind incurs a much larger number of collisions than other agents, providing evidence for 'wall-following' behavior. Depth-equipped agents have the lowest number of collisions, while RGB agents are in between.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2. Noisy Depth</head><p>To investigate the impact of noisy depth measurements on agent performance, we re-evaluated depth agents (without re-training) on noisy depth generated using a simple noise model: iid Gaussian noise (Âµ = 0, Ïƒ = 0.4) at each pixel in inverse depth (larger depth = more noise). We observe a drop of 0.13 and 0.02 SPL for depth-RL and SLAM on Gibson-val (depth-RL still outperforms SLAM). Note that SLAM from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> utilizes ORB-SLAM2, which is quite robust to noise, while depth-RL was trained without noise. If we increase Ïƒ to 0.1, depth-RL gets 0.12 SPL whereas SLAM suffers catastrophic failures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Gibson Dataset Curation</head><p>We manually curated the full dataset of Gibson 3D textured meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to select meshes that do not exhibit significant reconstruction artifacts such as holes or texture quality issues. A key issue that we tried to avoid is the presence of holes or cracks in floor surfaces. This is particularly problematic for navigation tasks as it divides seemingly connected navigable areas into non-traversable disconnected components. We manually annotated the scenes (using the 0 to 5 quality scale shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>) and only use scenes with a rating of 4 or higher, i.e., no holes, good reconstruction, and negligible texture issues to generate the dataset episodes.</p></div>

In contrast, depth-equipped agents are much more efficient, exhibiting fewer collisions, and navigating to goals more successfully (as indicated by the overall higher SPL values). 0: critical reconstruction artifacts, holes, or texture issues 1: big holes or significant texture issues and reconstruction artifacts 2: big holes or significant texture issues, but good reconstruction 3: small holes, some texture issues, good reconstruction 4: no holes, some texture issues, good reconstruction 5: no holes, uniform textures, good reconstruction </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Habitat Platform Details</head><p>As described in the main paper, Habitat consists of the following components:</p><p>â€¢ Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, multiple sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling (with built-in support for Matterport3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and other datasets). Habitat-Sim is fast -when rendering a realistic scanned scene from the Matterport3D dataset, Habitat-Sim achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. â€¢ Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for endto-end development of embodied AI -defining embodied AI tasks (e.g. navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, instruction following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), configuring embodied agents (physical form, sensors, capabilities), training these agents (via imitation or reinforcement learning, or via classic SLAM), and benchmarking their performance on the defined tasks using standard metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Habitat-API currently uses Habitat-Sim as the core simulator, but is designed with a modular abstraction for the simulator backend to maintain compatibility over multiple simulators. Key abstractions. The Habitat platform relies on a number of key abstractions that model the domain of embodied agents and tasks that can be carried out in three-dimensional indoor environments. Here we provide a brief summary of key abstractions:</p><p>â€¢ Agent: a physically embodied agent with a suite of Sensors. Can observe the environment and is capable of taking actions that change agent or environment state. â€¢ Sensor: associated with a specific Agent, capable of returning observation data from the environment at a specified frequency. â€¢ SceneGraph: a hierarchical representation of a 3D environment that organizes the environment into regions and objects which can be programmatically manipulated. â€¢ Simulator: an instance of a simulator backend.</p><p>Given actions for a set of configured Agents and SceneGraphs, can update the state of the Agents and SceneGraphs, and provide observations for all active Sensors possessed by the Agents. These abstractions connect the different layers of the platform. They also enable generic and portable specification of embodied AI tasks. Habitat-Sim. The architecture of the Habitat-Sim backend module is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The design of this module ensures a few key properties:</p><p>â€¢ Memory-efficient management of 3D environment resources (triangle mesh geometry, textures, shaders) ensuring shared resources are cached and reused.</p><p>â€¢ Flexible, structured representation of 3D environments using SceneGraphs, allowing for programmatic manipulation of object state, and combination of objects from different environments. â€¢ High-efficiency rendering engine with multi-attachment render pass to reduce overhead for multiple sensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â€¢ Arbitrary numbers of Agents and corresponding</head><p>Sensors that can be linked to a 3D environment by attachment to a SceneGraph. The performance of the simulation backend surpasses that of prior work operating on realistic reconstruction datasets by a large margin. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports performance statistics on a test scene from the Matterport3D dataset. Single-thread performance reaches several thousand frames per second (fps), while multi-process operation with several simulation backends can reach over 10,000 fps on a single GPU. In addition, by employing OpenGL-CUDA interoperation we enable direct sharing of rendered image frames with ML frameworks such as PyTorch without a measurable impact on performance as the image resolution is increased (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. Habitat-API. The second layer of the Habitat platform (Habitat-API) focuses on creating a general and flexible API for defining embodied agents, tasks that they may carry out, and evaluation metrics for those tasks. When designing such an API, a key consideration is to allow for easy extensibility of the defined abstractions. This is particularly important since many of the parameters of embodied agent tasks, specific agent configurations, and 3D environment setups can be varied in interesting ways. Future research is likely to propose new tasks, new agent configurations, and new 3D environments.</p><p>The API allows for alternative simulator backends to be used, beyond the Habitat-Sim module that we implemented. This modularity has the advantage of allowing incorporation of existing simulator backends to aid in transitioning from experiments that previous work has performed using legacy frameworks. The architecture of Habitat-API is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, indicating core API functionality and functionality implemented as extensions to the core.</p><p>Above the API level, we define a concrete embodied task such as visual navigation. This involves defining a specific dataset configuration, specifying the structure of episodes (e.g. number of steps taken, termination conditions), training curriculum (progression of episodes, difficulty ramp), and evaluation procedure (e.g. test episode sets and task metrics). An example of loading a pre-configured task (PointNav) and stepping through the environment with a random agent is shown in the code below.</p></div>			</div>
