<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Much research effort has been put to multilingual knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods to address the entity alignment task, which seeks to match entities in different languagespecific KGs that refer to the same real-world object. Such methods are often hindered by the insufficiency of seed alignment provided between KGs. Therefore, we propose an incidentally supervised model, JEANS , which jointly represents multilingual KGs and text corpora in a shared embedding scheme, and seeks to improve entity alignment with incidental supervision signals from text. JEANS first deploys an entity grounding process to combine each KG with the monolingual text corpus. Then, two learning processes are conducted: (i) an embedding learning process to encode the KG and text of each language in one embedding space, and (ii) a selflearning based alignment learning process to iteratively induce the matching of entities and that of lexemes between embeddings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that JEANS leads to promising improvement on entity alignment with incidental supervision, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods that solely rely on internal information of KGs. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A multilingual knowledge base (KB) such as DBpedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lehmann et al., 2015)</ref>, ConceptNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Speer et al., 2017)</ref> and Yago <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mahdisoltani et al., 2015)</ref> stores multiple language-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) that express relations of many concepts and real-world entities. As each KG thereof is either extracted independently from monolingual corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lehmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mahdisoltani et al., 2015)</ref> or contributed by speakers of the language <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Speer et al., 2017</ref>; * Indicating equal contributions.</p><p>1 Software and resources are available at http:// cogcomp.org/page/publication_view/929.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mitchell et al., 2018)</ref>, it is common for different KGs to constitute complementary knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bleiholder and Naumann, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bryl and Bizer, 2014)</ref>. Hence, aligning and synchronizing language-specific KGs support AI systems with more comprehensive commonsense reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yeo et al., 2018)</ref>, and benefit various knowledge-driven NLP tasks, including machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Moussallem et al., 2018)</ref>, narrative prediction  and dialogue agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sun et al., 2019a)</ref>.</p><p>Learning to align multilingual KGs is a nontrivial task, as KGs with distinct surface forms, heterogeneous schemata and inconsistent structures easily cause traditional symbolic methods to fall short <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Suchanek et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wijaya et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jiménez-Ruiz et al., 2012)</ref>. Recently, much attention has been paid to methods based on multilingual KG embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., ,b, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sun et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sun et al., , 2019b</ref>. Those methods seek to separately encode the structure of each language-specific KG in an embedding space. Then, based on some seed entity alignment, the entity counterparts in different KGs can be easily matched via distances or transformations of embedding vectors. The principle is that entities with relevant neighborhood information can be characterized with similar embedding representations. Such representations particularly are tolerant to the aforementioned heterogeneity of surface forms and schemata in language-specific KGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sun et al., , 2020a</ref>.</p><p>While multilingual KG embeddings provide a general and tractable way to align KGs, it still remains challenging for related methods to precisely infer the cross-lingual correspondence of entities. The challenge is that the seed entity alignment, which serves as the essential training data to learn the connection between language-specific KG embeddings, is often limitedly provided in KBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., 2018)</ref>. Hence, the lack of supervision often hinders the precision of inferred entity counterparts, and affects even more significantly when KGs scale up and become inconsistent in contents and density <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pujara et al., 2017)</ref>. Several methods also gain auxiliary supervision from profile information of entities, including descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019;</ref> and numerical attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sun et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Trsedya et al., 2019)</ref>. However, such profile information is not available in many KGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Speer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mitchell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bond and Foster, 2013)</ref>, therefore causing these methods to be not generally applicable.</p><p>Unlike existing models that rely on internal information of KGs, we seek to create embeddings that incorporate both KGs and freely available text corpora, and exploit incidental supervision signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Roth, 2017)</ref> from text corpora to enhance the alignment learning on KGs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>). In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model JEANS (Joint Embedding Based Entity Alignment with INcidental Supervision; ). Particularly, JEANS first performs a grounding process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gupta et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Upadhyay et al., 2018)</ref> to link entity mentions in each monolingual text corpus to the KG of the same language. Based on the KGs and grounded text in a pair of languages, JEANS conducts two learning processes, i.e. embedding learning and alignment learning. The embedding learning process distributes entities, relations and lexemes of each language in its embedding space, in which a KG embedding model and a language model for that language are jointly trained. This process seeks to leverage text contexts to help capture the proximity of entities. On top of that, alignment learning captures cross-lingual correspondence for entities and lexemes in a self-learning manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Artetxe et al., 2018)</ref>. Starting from a small amount of seed entity alignment, this process iteratively induces a transformation between language-specific embedding spaces, and infers more alignment of entity and lexemes at each iteration to improve the learning at the next one. Moreover, we also employ the closed-form Procrustes solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Conneau et al., 2018)</ref> to strengthen alignment induction within each iteration. Experimental results on two benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of JEANS in leveraging incidental supervision, leading to significant improvement to entity alignment and drastically outperforming existing methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We discuss relevant works in four topics. Each of them has a large body of work which we can only provide as a highly selected summary.</p><p>Entity alignment. Entity alignment in KBs has been a long-standing problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Shvaiko and Euzenat, 2011)</ref>. Aside from earlier approaches based on symbolic or schematic similarity of entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Suchanek et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wijaya et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jiménez-Ruiz et al., 2012)</ref>, more recent research addresses this task with multilingual KG embeddings. A representative method of such is MTransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a)</ref>. MTransE jointly learns two model components. There are a translational embedding model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bordes et al., 2013</ref>) that distributes the facts in language-specific KGs into separate embeddings, and a transformation-based alignment model that maps between entity counterparts across embedding spaces.</p><p>Following the general principle of MTransE, later approaches are developed through the following three lines. One is to incorporate various embedding learning techniques for KGs. Besides translational techniques, some models employ alternative relation modeling techniques to encode relation facts, such as circular correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Nickel et al., 2016)</ref>, Hadamard product <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hao et al., 2019)</ref> and recurrent skipping networks . Others encode entities with neighborhood aggregation techniques, including GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wu et al., 2019b)</ref>, RGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Wu et al., 2019a)</ref> and GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Zhu et al., 2019)</ref>. Their benefits are mainly to produce entity representations capturing high-order proximity, so as to better suit the alignment task. A few works follow the second line to enhance the alignment learning with semi-supervised learning techniques. Representative ones include co-training <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>, optimal transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pei et al., 2019b)</ref> and bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sun et al., 2018)</ref>, which improve the preciseness of alignment captured with limited supervision. The third line of research seeks to obtain additional supervision from entity profiles, including descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>, attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sun et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Trsedya et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pei et al., 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Yang et al., 2020)</ref> and KG schemata . While those alternative views of entities can effectively bridge the embeddings, the limitation of such methods lies in the unavailability of those views in many KGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Speer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mitchell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bond and Foster, 2013)</ref>. A survey on the entity alignment problem by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sun et al. (2020b)</ref> has provided a more comprehensive summarization of recent advances in these lines.</p><p>Our method is mainly related to the third line of research. While instead of leveraging specific intra-KB information, our method introduces supervision signals from text contexts that are freely accessible to almost any KBs with the aid of grounding techniques. Meanwhile, our paper also follows the second line to improve alignment learning techniques, and couples two mainstream techniques for embedding learning.</p><p>Joint embeddings of entities and text. Fewer efforts have been put to jointly characterize entities and text as embeddings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wang et al. (2014b)</ref> propose to connect a translational embedding of Freebase <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref> to a English word embedding based on Wikipedia anchors, therefore providing a joint embedding to enhance link prediction in the KG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zhong et al. (2015)</ref> generalize the approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wang et al. (2014b)</ref> with distant supervision based on entity descriptions and text corpora. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Toutanova et al. (2015)</ref> extract dependency paths from sentences and jointly embed them with a KG using DistMult <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Yang et al., 2015)</ref> to support the relation extraction task. Several other approaches focus on jointly embedding words, entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Yamada et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Newman-Griffis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almasian et al., 2019)</ref> and entity types <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gupta et al., 2017)</ref> appearing in the same textual contexts without considering relational structure of a KG. These ap-proaches are employed in monolingual NLP tasks including entity linking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gupta et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cao et al., 2017)</ref>, entity abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Newman-Griffis et al., 2018)</ref> and factoid QA <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Yamada et al., 2017)</ref>. As they focus on a monolingual and supervised scenario, they are essentially different from our goal to help cross-lingual KG alignment with incidental supervision from unparalleled corpora.</p><p>Multilingual word embeddings. Our model component of alignment induction from text is closely connected to multilingual word embeddings. Earlier approaches in this line, regardless of being supervised or weakly supervised, based on seed lexicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Zou et al., 2013)</ref> or parallel corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gouws et al., 2015)</ref>, are systematically summarized in a recent survey (2017). While a number of methods in this line can be employed in our model to gain addition supervision for entity alignment, we choose to use a combination of Procrustes solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Conneau et al., 2018)</ref> with selflearning to offer precise inference of cross-lingual alignment based on limited seed alignment. Note that recent contextualized embeddings such M-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pires et al., 2019)</ref> and XLM-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Conneau et al., 2020)</ref> do not directly suit our problem setting, since contextualization could cause ambiguity to entity representations, therefore impairing the alignment of entities across embedding spaces.</p><p>Incidental supervision. Incidental supervision is a recently introduced learning strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Roth, 2017)</ref>, which seeks to retrieve supervision signals from data that are not labeled for the target task. This strategy has been applied to tasks including SRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(He et al., 2020)</ref>, controversy prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rethmeier et al., 2018)</ref> and dataless classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Song and Roth, 2015)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method here is the first of its kind that incorporates incidental supervision in embedding learning or alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>We hereby begin introducing our method with the formalization of learning resources.</p><p>In a KB, L denotes the set of languages, and L 2 unordered language pairs. G L is the languagespecific KG of language L ∈ L. E L and R L respectively denote the corresponding vocabularies of entities and relations. T = (h, r, t) denotes a triple in G L such that h, t ∈ E L and r ∈ R L . Boldfaced h, r, t represent the embedding vectors of head h, relation r, and tail t respectively. For a language pair (L 1 , L 2 ) ∈ L 2 , I E (L 1 , L 2 ) denotes a set of entity alignments between L 1 and L 2 , such that e 1 ∈ E L 1 and e 2 ∈ E L 2 for each entity pair (e 1 , e 2 ) ∈ I E (L 1 , L 2 ). Following the convention of previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>, we assume the entity pairs to have a 1-to-1 mapping and it is specified in I E (L 1 , L 2 ). This assumption is congruent to the design of mainstream KBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lehmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mahdisoltani et al., 2015)</ref> where disambiguation of entities is granted. Besides the definition of multilingual KGs, we use D L to denote the text corpus of language L. D L is a set of documents</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{d L }, where each document d L = [w 1 , w 2 , ..., w l ]</formula><p>is a sequence of tokens from the monolingual lexicon W L . Each token w i thereof is originally a lexeme, but may also be an entity surface form after the ground process, and we also use boldfaced w i to denote its vector. I W (L 1 , L 2 ) denotes the seed lexicon between (L 1 , L 2 ), such that w 1 ∈ W L 1 and w 2 ∈ W L 2 for each lexeme pair (w 1 , w 2 ) ∈ I W (L 1 , L 2 ). Note that I W only include the alignment between lexemes, and may optionally serve as external supervision data. To be consistent with previous problem settings of entity alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>, I W is not necessarily provided to training, but is defined to be compatible with the scenarios where it is available.</p><p>JEANS addresses entity alignment in three consecutive processes. (i) A grounding process first link entities of each KG to possible mentions of them in the corresponding monolingual corpus, therefore connecting entities and text tokens of the same language into a shared vocabulary. (ii) An embedding learning process characterizes the KG and text of each language into a separate embedding space. In this process, we couple both the translational technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bordes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chen et al., 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chen et al., , 2018</ref> and the neighborhood aggregation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>, which are two representative techniques to characterize a KG. Simultaneously, the monolingual text tokens are encoded with a skip-gram language model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. (iii) On top of the embeddings, starting from a small amount of seed entity alignment and optional seed lexicon, the alignment learning process iteratively infers more alignment both on KGs and text using selflearning and Procrustes solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Schönemann, 1966)</ref>. The processes of JEANS's learning is consistent to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The rest of this section introduces the technical details of each process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">(Noisy) Entity Grounding</head><p>The goal of the grounding process is to combine vocabularies of the KG and the text corpus in each language. This serves as the premise for the embedding learning process to produce a shared representation scheme for entities, relations and lexemes, therefore allowing the alignment learning process to leverage supervision signals for both entities and lexemes. It is noteworthy that, the purpose of entity grounding here is to combine the two data modalities. Hence, we only expect this process to discover enough entity contexts and offer a higher coverage on entity vocabularies, while being tolerant to possible noise in entity recognition and linking. Particularly, we consider two grounding techniques, one using a pre-trained entity discovery and linking (EDL) model, the other based on simple surface form matching (SFM).</p><p>Pre-trained EDL model. One technique is to use off-the-shelf EDL models <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Khashabi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Manning et al., 2014)</ref>. A typical model of such sequentially handles the steps of NER to detect entity mentions, and link each mention to candidate entities from the KG based on symbolic and contextual similarity. Many EDL models are easily trainable on large text corpora with anchors, and offer promising performance of grounding and disambiguation on multiple languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sil et al., 2018)</ref>. In this paper, we do not go into details to the design of EDL models. Interested readers are referred to the aforementioned literature.</p><p>Surface form matching. Suppose a pre-trained EDL model is not available, then a simpler way of combining data is to match KG surface forms with text. This can be efficiently done by building a Completion Trie <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hsu and Ottaviano, 2013)</ref> for multi-token surface forms, and conducting a longest prefix matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dharmapurikar et al., 2006)</ref> between surface forms and sub-sequences of text tokens. While this simple technique does not necessarily disambiguate entity mentions, experiments find it sufficient to combine the two modalities and allow supervision signals from induced lexical alignment to propagate to entities.</p><p>Once the entity vocabulary E L and the lexicon W L of a language are combined, we assume that entity mentions in D L are properly tokenized as grounded surface forms in E L ∩ W L . Specifically, we now use x to denote a token in the grounded corpus D L that can either be an entity e or a lexeme w. Given the combined learning resources for each language, we next describe the processes of embedding learning and alignment learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Embedding Learning</head><p>The embedding learning process is responsible for capturing the combined KG and text corpus of each language in a shared embedding space R k . In this process, JEANS jointly learns two model components to respectively encode units of the KG and the text, among which the overlaps E L ∩ W L use shared representations. We hereby describe these two model components in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">KG Embedding</head><p>As discussed in §2, previous approaches respectively leverage two forms of embedding learning techniques: (i) relation modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., 2018)</ref> such as vector translations, circular correlation and Hadamard product seeks to capture relations as an arithmetic operation in the vector space; (ii) neighborhood aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cao et al., 2019)</ref> employs graph neural networks (GNN) to encode neighborhood contexts for better seizing the proximity of entities.</p><p>The KG embedding model proposed in this work couples both forms of techniques. This aims at seizing both relations and entity proximity, two factors that are both beneficial to produce transferable entity embeddings. To achieve this goal, the encoder first stacks n layers of GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2016) on the KG. Formally, the l-th layer representation E (l) is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E (l) = φ D − 1 2Ã D − 1 2 E (l−1) M (l−1) ,</formula><p>where D is the diagonal degree matrix D of the KG,Ã = A + I is the sum of the adjacency matrix A and an identity I, and M (l−1) is a trainable weight matrix. The raw features of entities E (0) can be either entity attributes or randomly initialized. The last layer outputs are regarded as entity embedding representations, i.e. E = E (n) .</p><p>We use E L to denote the entity representations of language L, then the following log-softmax loss is optimized to perform relational modeling with translation vectors in the embedding space of L:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S K L = − T ∈G L log exp (b − f r (h, t)) T / ∈G L exp b − f r (ĥ,t) ,</formula><p>where f r (h, t) = h + r − t is the plausibility measure of a triple <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bordes et al., 2013)</ref>, T = (ĥ, r,t) is a Bernoulli negative-sampled triple <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wang et al., 2014a)</ref> created by substituting either head or tail entities h or t in T = (h, r, t). b is a positive bias to adjust the scale of the plausibility measure. All the entity representations optimized in S K L are from E L . Note that the reason for us to choose the translational technique over other relation modeling techniques is due to this technique being more robust in cases where KG structures are sparser <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pujara et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Text Embedding</head><p>In addition to the KG embedding, the text embedding seeks to leverage the contextual information of free text to help the embedding better capture the proximity of entities This model employs the continuous skip-gram language model, which is inline with a number of word embedding methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bojanowski et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Conneau et al., 2018)</ref>, and is realized by optimizing the following log-softmax loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S T L = − x∈E L ∪W L xc∈C x,D L log exp (d(x, x c )) xn exp (d(x, x n ))</formula><p>.</p><p>The text context C x,D L thereof is the set of tokens that surround a token x in the entity-grounded corpus D L , d denotes the l 2 distance, and x n denotes a randomly sampled token in E L ∪ W L .</p></div>

The rest lexeme, relation and entity representations are optimized alternately by either component. In both model components, the number of negative samples of triples and tokens are both adjustable hyperparameters.</p><p>It is noteworthy that, both model components may choose alternative techniques, including other KG encoders such as GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Veličković et al., 2018)</ref>, multi-channel GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cao et al., 2019)</ref> and gated GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., 2020a)</ref>, and text embeddings such as GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>. As experimenting with different embedding techniques is not a main contribution of this work, we leave them as future work. Specifically, contextualized text representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Peters et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> cannot directly apply, as contextualization will cause ambiguity to token representations that hinder the match of embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Alignment Learning</head><p>Once the KG and text units of each language are captured in a shared embedding, the alignment learning process therefore bridges the alignment between each pair of embeddings. This process seeks to exploit additional alignment labels from text embeddings, and use those to help the alignment of entities. Different from the majority of methods in §2 that jointly learn embeddings and alignment, the alignment learning process in JEANS is a retrofitting process <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Faruqui et al., 2015)</ref>. Hence, the embedding of each language is fixed and does not require duplicate training for different language pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sun et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Given a pair of languages (L i , L j ) ∈ L 2 , the objective of alignment learning is to induce a transformation M ij ∈ R k×k between the two embedding spaces. The following loss is minimized</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S A L i ,L j = (x i ,x j )∈I(L i ,L j ) M ij x i − x j 2 , in which I(L i , L j ) = I E (L i , L j ) ∪ I W (L i , L j )</formula><p>, and the word seed lexicon I W is considered additional supervision data that are optionally provided. Each x i (x j ) denotes a fixed representation of either an entity or a lexeme of L i (L j ). Starting from a small amount of seed alignment in I(L i , L j ), JEANS conducts an iterative selflearning process to exploit more alignment labels for both entities and lexemes to improve the learning of M ij . In each iteration, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Conneau et al. (2018)</ref> to induce a Procrustes solution for M ij . To propose new alignment labels, the self-learning technique in JEANS deploys a mutual nearest neighbor (NN) constraint, which requires a suggested pair of matched items to appear in the NN of each other. More specifically, define N K L i (x) as the K-NN of vector x in the embedding space of L i , this constraint requires a proposed match (</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x i , x j ) to be inserted into I only if M ij x i is in N 1 L j (x j )</formula><p>, and x j mutually appears in N 1 L j (M ij x i ). Besides, we also require (x i , x j ) to be of the same type, i.e. both being entities or being lexemes. Particularly, we only select entities that have not been aligned in I to form the newly-proposed (x i , x j ). This respects the 1-to-1 matching constraint of entities being defined at the beginning of this section, and effectively reduces the candidate space after each iteration of self-learning. Meanwhile, 1-to-1 matching is not required for lexemes. To mitigate hubness, we also follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Conneau et al. (2018)</ref> to employ the Crossdomain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS) measure.</p><p>After the iteration, the newly proposed alignment labels are inserted to I to enhance the learning at the next iteration. The iterative self-learning is stopped once the number of proposed entity alignment in an iteration is below certain quantity (e.g. 1% of |E L i |). With more and more matched entities and lexemes being exploited within each iteration, a better M ij is induced, whereas the lexical alignment naturally serve as incidental supervision signals for entity alignment.</p><p>After the alignment learning process, given a query (e i , ?e j ) to find the counterpart entity of e i ∈ E L i from E L j , the answer e j is predicted as the 1-NN entity after applying M ij to transform e i , denoted {e j } = N 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E L i (M ij e i ).</formula><p>The inference phase by default also adopts CSLS as the distance measure, which is consistent with the default setting of recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sun et al., 2019b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., , 2020a</ref>.</p></div>

Three sets of 15k alignment labels are constructed to align entities between each of the other three languages and English. WK3l60k contains larger KGs with around 57k to 65k entities in En, Fr and German (De) KGs, and around 55k reference entity alignment for En-Fr and En-De settings. Dataset statistics are given in Appendix §A.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>. We also use the text of Wikipedia dumps (dated Jan 1, 2019) in the five participating languages in training.

We compare with a wide selection of recent approaches for entity alignment on multilingual KGs. The baseline methods include (i) those employing different structure embedding techniques, namely MTransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a)</ref>, GCN-Align , AlignE <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sun et al., 2018)</ref>, GCN-JE <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wu et al., 2019b)</ref>, KECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Li et al., 2019a)</ref>, MuGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cao et al., 2019)</ref>, RotatE <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sun et al., 2019c)</ref>, RSN  and AliNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., 2020a)</ref>; (ii) methods that incorporate auxiliary information of entities, namely JAPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sun et al., 2017)</ref>, SEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pei et al., 2019a)</ref>, GMN  and HMAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>; (iii) semi-supervised alignment learning methods, including BootEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sun et al., 2018)</ref>, KDCoE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>, MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shi and Xiao, 2019)</ref>, NAEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Zhu et al., 2019)</ref> and OTEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pei et al., 2019b)</ref>. Descriptions of these methods are given in Appendix §A.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>. Note that some works have allowed to incorporate extra cross-lingual signals such as machine translation in training, or using pre-aligned word embeddings to delimit candidate spaces <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2019a,b;</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. (2019a,b)</ref> used Google Translate to translate surface forms of entities in all other languages to English, and initialize the entity embeddings in their model with pre-trained word embedding of translated entity names. Results for these models are reported for the versions where the extra crosslingual alignment information is removed so as to conduct fair comparison with all the rest models that are trained from scratch and using the same alignment labels in the benchmark datasets. This also necessarily prevents potential leakage of testing data to training , considering that training a comprehensive NMT system may have subsumed many of the testing data in the entity alignment benchmarks.</p><p>Evaluation protocols. The use of the datasets are consistent with previous studies of the baseline methods. On each language pair in DBP15k, around 30% of seed alignment is used for training, the rest for testing. On WK3l60k, 20% of seed alignment on En-Fr and En-De settings is respectively used for training. Following the convention, we calculate several ranking metrics on test cases, including the accuracy H @1, the proportion of cases that are ranked no larger than p H @p, and mean reciprocal rank MRR. Note that to align with the results in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pei et al., 2019b)</ref>, p is set to 10 on DBP15k and 5 on WK3l60k. All metrics are preferred higher to indicate better performance.</p><p>Model Configurations. We use AMSGrad <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Reddi et al., 2018)</ref> to optimize the training losses of the embedding learning process, for which we set the learning rate α to 0.001, the exponential decay rates β 1 and β 2 to 0.9 and 0.999, and batch sizes to 512 for both S K L and S T L . Trainable parameters are initialized using Xavier initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Glorot and Bengio, 2010)</ref>. The dimension k is set to 300, which is often used for bilingual word embedding models trained on Wikipedia corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Conneau et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gouws et al., 2015)</ref>, considering that the vocabulary sizes and training data density here are relatively close to those models. The number of GCN layers is set to 2. We set negative sample sizes of triples and text contexts to 5, the text context width to be 10 and the bias b in S K L to be 2. More implementation details are in Appendix §A.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>. Specifically, we evaluate variants of JEANS by adjusting two technical details. First, for the grounding process, aside from the simple surface form matching (marked with SFM), we also explore with the offthe-shelf Wikification-based EDL model <ref type="bibr">(Upadhyay et al., 2018, marked with EDL)</ref>. A grounding performance estimation is given in §4.4. In addition, we consider both CSLS and l 2 in inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>We report the entity alignment results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Considering the baseline results on DBP15k, we can see that the simplest variant of JEANS using SFM-based grounding has consistently outperformed all baselines on three cross-lingual settings. Particularly, it leads to 17.0-17.4% of absolute improvement in H @1 over the best structure-based baseline, 14.0-22.3% over the best entity profile based one, and 6.30-9.30% over the best semi-supervised one. This shows that while JEANS preserves the key merit of a semi-   supervised entity alignment method, and effectively enhances the alignment of KGs by exploiting incidental supervision signals from unaligned text corpora. Considering different grounding techniques, we observe that SFM variants often perform closely to EDL ones. This indicates that simple SFM is enough to combine KG and text corpora for JEANS's embedding learning without EDL-related resources. The results on Wk3l60k generally exhibit similar observations. In comparison to KDCoE that leverages strong but expensive supervision data of entity descriptions in cotraining, JEANS offers comparable performance based on very accessible resources. In general, the experiments here show that JEANS promisingly improves SOTA performance for entity alignment, with only the need for unparalleled free text and no need for additional labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Study</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> we report an ablation study for JEANS-SFM based on DBP15k, so as to understand the importance of each incorporated technique.</p><p>From the results, we observe that self-learning is the most important factor. The removal of it can lead to a drop of 10.1-13.8% in H @1, as well as drastic drop of other metrics. This also explains why semi-supervised baselines (group 3) typically perform better than others. However, even with self-learning, the removal of text can lead to H @1 drop of 2.4% on En-Fr and 4.2% on En-Ja. This shows that context information JEANS retrieves from free text effectively infers the match of entities. On the other hand, the structure encoding of KGs is more important than textual contexts, as it causes higher performance drops of 6.7-8.8% in H @1 by removing KGs. Note that the model without KG learns entity embeddings solely based on free text. Its results show that context information from text alone can provide a strong starting point from which incorporating KGs can further enhance its performance. Employing GCN leads to relatively slight performance gain, as joint learning the relation model and the language model can satisfyingly capture entity proximity. Changing the distance metric to l 2 also leads to 3.6-6.9% of decrease in H @1. This shows CSLS's ability to handle hubness and isolation is also important for similarity inference in the dense embedding space for the metric words and entities. Hence, this metric is also recommended by recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sun et al., , 2019b</ref>. In addition, if we introduce additional 5k seed lexicon (with only word alignment information, not including any entity alignment) provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Conneau et al. (2018)</ref> for each language pair, it leads to additional improvement of 1.5-2.2% in H @1. This shows that JEANS effectively leverages available supervision data on lexemes to further enhance entity alignment, although it is not obligatory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Grounding Performance Estimation</head><p>Due to the lack of ground truths on unlabeled text, it is hard to estimate the precision of entity grounding by the two types of (noisy) grounding techniques. However, as the requirement of the grounding process is to simply connect two data modalities for training the embeddings, we may encourage a technique that handles enough entity mentions and offer a higher coverage on entity vocabularies. Accordingly, the estimations of these two factors for the two techniques are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. As we can observe that, without considering disambiguation, SFM can overall cover higher proportions of the entity vocabularies, while pretrained EDL generally discovers more entity mentions for each entity. However, both techniques are sufficient to support the noisy grounding process and combine two data modalities for embedding learning and alignment induction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduces JEANS for entity alignment. Different from previous methods that leverage only internal information of KGs, JEANS extends the learning on any text corpora that may contain the KG entities. For each language, a noisy grounding process first connects both data modalities, followed by an embedding learning process coupling GCN with relational modeling, and an self-learning based alignment process. Without introducing additional labeled data, JEANS offers significantly improved performance over SOTA models on benchmarks. Hence, it shows the effectiveness and feasibility of exploiting incidental supervision from free text for entity alignment.</p><p>For future work, aside from experimenting with other embedding learning techniques for KGs and text, we plan to extend JEANS to learn associations on KGs with different specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hao et al., 2019)</ref>. We also seek to extend the representation scheme in hyperbolic spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nickel and Kiela, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen and Quirk, 2019)</ref> along with the incorporation of hyperbolic lexical embedding techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Tifrea et al., 2018)</ref>, aiming at better capturing the associations for hierarchical ontologies.   Statistics of the datasets are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4  and Table 5</ref>. As described, the partition and use of these datasets are consistent with previous papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sun et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sun et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pei et al., 2019b)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Descriptions of Baseline Methods</head><p>We provide descriptions of baseline methods. In accord with §4.1, we also separate the descriptions in three groups.</p><p>MTransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2017a)</ref> represents a pioneering method of this topic. It jointly learns a translational embedding model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bordes et al., 2013)</ref> and an alignment model that captures the correspondence of counterpart entities via transformations or distances of the embedding representations.</p><p>Based on the methodology of MTransE, GCN-Align  substitute the translational embedding model with GCN to better capture the entity based on their neighborhood structures. MECG <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Li et al., 2019a)</ref> extends the framework of GCN-Align with regularization term based on relational translation, aiming at differentiating between the information neighboring entities that play different roles of relations. GCN-JE <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wu et al., 2019b)</ref> extends the GCN-Align architecture with embedding calibration also on relations. MuGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cao et al., 2019)</ref> combines multiple channels of GCNs to better model the heterogeneous neighborhood information of entities in different KGs. For the same purpose, AliNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sun et al., 2020a)</ref> incorporates a gate mechanism in the neighborhood aggregation process of GAT. Both techniques offer satisfying performance in entity alignment without a transformation between KG-specific embedding spaces. Different from these neighborhood aggregation techniques, RSN  focuses capturing the long-term relational dependency of entities by incorporating a gated recurrent network with highway links, and offers comparable performance to MuGCN. Besides the above embedding learning techniques, single-graph KG embedding models have also been evaluated for entity alignment in recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sun et al., 2020a)</ref>, by simply treating the match of entities as a type of relation in the KG. According to these studies, while RotatE <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sun et al., 2019c)</ref> outperforms others single-graph embedding models, it is significantly outperformed by most aforementioned entity alignment methods.</p><p>Besides different embedding learning techniques, there are approaches to obtain additional supervision signals from profile information of entities that are available in some KBs. JAPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sun et al., 2017)</ref> introduces an auxiliary measure of entity attributes, and use this to strengthen the cross-lingual learning of MTransE. SEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pei et al., 2019a)</ref> also obtains similarly auxiliary supervision signals based on centrality measures. HMAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref> is a GCN-based model that incorporates various modalities of entity information, including entity names, attributes, and literal descriptions that are also leveraged in KD-CoE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Another line of research focuses on semisupervised alignment learning to capture the entity alignment based on limited labels. BootEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sun et al., 2018)</ref>, MMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shi and Xiao, 2019)</ref> and NAEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Zhu et al., 2019)</ref> similarly conducts an self-learning approach to iteratively propose alignment label on unaligned entities, The main difference of these three models lies in the embedding learning techniques, given that BootEA is translational, MMR is GCN based, and NAEA is GAT-based. It is noteworthy that, NAEA also incorporates the mutual nearest neighbor constraint in proposing new alignment labels. KD-CoE adopts an iterative co-training process of MTransE with another self-attentive Siamese encoder of entity descriptions, and both model components alternately propose alignment labels. Different from those iterative learning processes, OTEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pei et al., 2019b)</ref> employs an optimal transport solution that is similar to the Procrustas solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Schönemann, 1966)</ref> used in this work.</p></div>			</div>
