<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Semantic image segmentation is crucial to many biomedical imaging applications, such as performing population analyses, diagnosing disease, and planning treatments. When enough labeled data is available, supervised deep learning-based segmentation methods produce stateof-the-art results. However, obtaining manual segmentation labels for medical images requires considerable expertise and time. In most clinical image datasets, there are very  few manually labeled images. The problem of limited labeled data is exacerbated by differences in image acquisition procedures across machines and institutions, which can produce wide variations in resolution, image noise, and tissue appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, many supervised biomedical segmentation methods focus on hand-engineered preprocessing steps and architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. It is also common to use hand-tuned data augmentation to increase the number of training examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. Data augmentation functions such as random image rotations or random nonlinear deformations are easy to implement, and are effective at improving segmentation accuracy in some settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. However, these functions have limited ability to emulate real variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and can be highly sensitive to the choice of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>We address the challenges of limited labeled data by learning to synthesize diverse and realistic labeled examples. Our novel, automated approach to data augmentation leverages unlabeled images. Using learning-based registration methods, we model the set of spatial and appearance transformations between images in the dataset. These models capture the anatomical and imaging diversity in the unlabeled images. We synthesize new examples by sampling transformations and applying them to a single labeled example.</p><p>We demonstrate the utility of our method on the task of one-shot segmentation of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We use our method to synthesize new labeled training examples, enabling the training of a supervised segmentation network. This strategy outperforms state-of-the art one-shot biomedical segmentation approaches, including single-atlas segmentation and supervised segmentation with hand-tuned data augmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work 2.1. Medical image segmentation</head><p>We focus on the segmentation of brain MR images, which is challenging for several reasons. Firstly, human brains exhibit substantial anatomical variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. Secondly, MR image intensity can vary as a result of subject-specific noise, scanner protocol and quality, and other imaging parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This means that a tissue class can appear with different intensities across imageseven images of the same MRI modality.</p><p>Many existing segmentation methods rely on scan preprocessing to mitigate these intensity-related challenges. Pre-processing methods can be costly to run, and developing techniques for realistic datasets is an active area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. Our augmentation method tackles these intensity-related challenges from another angle: rather than removing intensity variations, it enables a segmentation method to be robust to the natural variations in MRI scans.</p><p>A large body of classical segmentation methods use atlas-based or atlas-guided segmentation, in which a labeled reference volume, or atlas, is aligned to a target volume using a deformation model, and the labels are propagated using the same deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. When multiple atlases are available, they are each aligned to a target volume, and the warped atlas labels are fused <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. In atlas-based approaches, anatomical variations between subjects are captured by a deformation model, and the challenges of intensity variations are mitigated using pre-processed scans, or intensity-robust metrics such as normalized cross-correlation. However, ambiguities in tissue appearances (e.g., indistinct tissue boundaries, image noise) can still lead to inaccurate registration and segmentations. We address this limitation by training a segmentation model on diverse realistic examples, making the segmenter more robust to such ambiguities. We focus on having a single atlas, and demonstrate that our strategy out-performs atlas-based segmentation. If more than one segmented example is available, our method can leverage them.</p><p>Supervised learning approaches to biomedical segmentation have gained popularity in recent years. To mitigate the need for large labeled training datasets, these methods often use data augmentation along with hand-engineered preprocessing steps and architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>.</p><p>Semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches have also been proposed to combat the challenges of small training datasets. These methods do not require paired image and segmentation data. Rather, they leverage collections of segmentations to build anatomical priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, to train an adversarial network <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, or to train a novel semantic constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In practice, collections of images are more readily available than segmentations. Rather than rely on segmentations, our method leverages a set of unlabeled images.</p></div>

We leverage VoxelMorph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, a recent unsupervised learningbased method, to learn spatial transformations.</p><p>Many medical image registration methods focus on intensity-normalized images or intensity-independent objective functions, and do not explicitly account for variations in image intensity. For unnormalized images, models of intensity transforms have used to remove bias field effects from MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Spatial and appearance transform models have been used together to register objects that differ in shape as well as texture. Many works build upon the framework of Morphable Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> or Active Appearance Models (AAMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, in which statistical models of shape and texture are constructed. AAMs have been used to localize anatomical landmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> and perform segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. We build upon these concepts by using convolutional neural networks to learn models of unconstrained spatial and intensity transformations. Rather than learning transform models for the end goal of registration or segmentation, we sample from these models to synthesize new training examples. As we show in our experiments, augmenting a segmenter's training set in this way can produce more robust segmentations than performing segmentation using the transform models directly.</p></div>

In brain MRI segmentation, each x and y is a grayscale 3D volume. We focus on the challenging case where only one labeled atlas is available, since it is often difficult in practice to obtain many segmented volumes. Our method can be easily extended to leverage additional segmented volumes.</p><p>To perform data augmentation, we apply transformations τ (k) to the labeled atlas x. We first learn separate spatial and appearance transform models to capture the distribution of anatomical and appearance differences between the labeled atlas and each unlabeled volume. Using the two learned models, we synthesize labeled volumes {(ŷ (k) ,l (k) y )} by applying a spatial transformation and an appearance transformation to the atlas volume, and by warping the atlas label maps using the spatial transformation. Compared to singleatlas segmentation, which suffers from uncertainty or errors in the spatial transform model, we use the same spatial transformation to synthesize the volume and label map, ensuring that the newly synthesized volume is correctly labeled. These synthetic examples form a labeled dataset that characterizes the anatomical and appearance variations in the unlabeled dataset. Along with the atlas, this new training set enables us to train a supervised segmentation network. This process is outlined in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Spatial and appearance transform models</head><p>We describe the differences between scans using a combination of spatial and intensity transformations. Specifically, we define a transformation τ (·) from one volume to another as a composition of a spatial transformation τ s (·) and an intensity or appearance transformation τ a (·), i.e., τ (·) = τ s (τ a (·)).</p><p>We assume a spatial transformation takes the form of a smooth voxel-wise displacement field u. Following the medical registration literature, we define the deformation function φ = id + u, where id is the identity function.</p><p>We use x • φ to denote the application of the deformation φ to x. To model the distribution of spatial transformations in our dataset, we compute the deformation that warps atlas x to each volume y (i) using φ (i) = g θs (x, y (i) ), where g θs (·, ·) is a parametric function that we describe later. We write approximate inverse deformation of y (i) to x as φ −1 (i) = g θs (y (i) , x). We model the appearance transformation τ a (·) as per-voxel addition in the spatial frame of the atlas. We compute this per-voxel volume using the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ψ (i) = h θa (x, y (i) • φ −1 (i) ), where y (i) • φ −1 (i)</formula><p>is a volume that has been registered to the atlas space using our learned spatial model. In summary, our spatial and appearance transformations are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ (i) s (x) = x • φ (i) , φ = g θs (x, y (i) ) (1) τ (i) a (x) = x + ψ (i) , ψ (i) = h θa (x, y (i) • φ −1 (i) ). (2)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Learning</head><p>We aim to capture the distributions of the transformations τ s and τ a between the atlas and the unlabeled volumes. We estimate the functions g θs (·, ·) and h θa (·, ·) in Eqs. (1) and (2) using separate convolutional neural networks, with each network using the general architecture outlined in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Drawing on insights from Morphable Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and Active Appearance Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, we optimize the spatial and appearance models independently. For our spatial model, we leverage VoxelMorph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, a recent unsupervised learning-based approach with an open-source implementation. VoxelMorph learns to output a smooth displacement vector field that registers one image to another by jointly optimizing an image similarity loss and a displacement field smoothness term. We use a variant of VoxelMorph with normalized cross-correlation as the image similarity loss, enabling the estimation of g θs (·, ·) with unnormalized input volumes.</p><p>We use a similar approach to learn the appearance model. Naively, one might define h θa (·, ·) from Eq. (2) as a simple per-voxel subtraction of the volumes in the atlas space. While this transformation would perfectly reconstruct the target image, it would include extraneous details when the registration function φ −1 is imperfect, resulting in image details in x + ψ that do not match the anatomical labels. We instead design h θa (·, ·) as a neural network that produces a per-voxel intensity change in an anatomically consistent manner. Specifically, we use an image similarity loss as well as a semantically-aware smoothness regularization. Given the network output ψ (i) = h θa (x, y (i) • φ −1 ), we define a smoothness regularization function based on the atlas segmentation map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L smooth (c x , ψ) = (1 − c x )∇ψ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where c x is a binary image of anatomical boundaries computed from the atlas segmentation labels l x , and ∇ is the spatial gradient operator. Intuitively, this term discourages dramatic intensity changes within the same anatomical region.</p><p>In the total appearance transform model loss L a , we use mean squared error for the image similarity loss L sim (ŷ, y) = ||ŷ − y|| 2 . In our experiments, we found that computing the image similarity loss in the spatial frame of the subject was helpful. We balance the similarity loss with the regularization term L smooth :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L a (x, y (i) , φ (i) , φ −1 (i) , ψ (i) , c x ) = L sim (x + ψ (i) ) • φ (i) , y (i) + λ a L smooth (c x , ψ (i) ),</formula><p>where λ a is a hyperparameter.</p></div>

(1) and (2) enable us to sample spatial and appearance transformations τ</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(i) s , τ (j) a</formula><p>by sampling target volumes y (i) , y (j) from an unlabeled dataset. Since the spatial and appearance targets can be different subjects, our method can combine the spatial variations of one subject with the intensities of another into a single synthetic volumeŷ.

The application of a spatial transformation to an image is implemented using a differentiable 3D spatial transformer layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; a similar layer that uses nearest neighbor interpolation is used to transform segmentation maps. For simplicity, we capture the forward and inverse spatial transformations described in Section 3.1 using two identical neural networks. For the appearance transform model, we use the hyperparameter setting λ a = 0.02. We train our transform models with a single pair of volumes in each batch, and train the segmentation model with a batch size of 16 slices. All models are trained with a learning rate of 5e −4 .

With 100 unlabeled targets, we obtain 100 spatial and 100 appearance transformations, enabling the synthesis of 10, 000 different labeled examples. Due to memory constraints, we synthesize a random labeled example in each training iteration, rather than adding all 10, 000 new examples to the training set.</p><p>Coupled sampling (ours-coupled): To highlight the efficacy of our independent transform models, we compare ours-indep to a variant of our method where we sample each of the spatial and appearance transformations from the same target image. This results in 100 possible synthetic examples. As in ours-indep, we synthesize a random example in each training iteration.</p><p>Ours-indep + rand-aug: When training the segmenter, we alternate between examples synthesized using ours-indep, and examples synthesized using rand-aug. The addition of hand-tuned augmentation to our synthetic augmentation could introduce additional variance that is unseen even in the unlabeled set, improving the robustness of the segmenter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>We evaluate the accuracy of each segmentation method in terms of Dice score <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which quantifies the overlap between two anatomical regions. A Dice score of 1 indicates perfectly overlapping regions, while 0 indicates no overlap. The predicted segmentation labels are evaluated relative to anatomical labels generated using FreeSurfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the segmentation accuracy attained by each method. Our methods outperform all baselines in mean  In Figs. 4 and 5, we compare each method to the singleatlas segmentation baseline. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> shows that our methods attain the most improvement on average, and are more consistent than hand-tuned random augmentation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref> shows that ours-indep + rand-aug is consistently better than each baseline on every test subject. Ours-indep alone is always better than SAS-aug and SAS, and is better than rand-aug on 95 of the 100 test scans. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows that rand-aug improves Dice over SAS on large anatomical structures, but is detrimental for smaller ones. In contrast, our methods produce consistent improvements over SAS and SAS-aug across all structures. We show several examples of segmented hippocampi in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Why do we outperform single-atlas segmentation? Our methods rely on the same spatial registration model that is used for SAS and SAS-aug. Both ours-coupled and SAS-aug augment the segmenter training set with 100 new images.</p><p>To understand why our method produces better segmentations, we examine the augmented images. Our method warps the image in the same way as the labels, ensuring that the warped labels match the transformed image. On the other hand, SAS-aug applies the warped labels to the original image, so any errors or noise in the registration results in a mis-labeled new training example for the segmenter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref> highlights examples where our method synthesizes image texture within the hippocampus label that is more consistent with the texture of the ground truth hippocampus, resulting in a more useful synthetic training example.</p><p>Extensions Our framework lends itself to several plausible future extensions. In Section 3.1, we discussed the use of an approximate inverse deformation function for learning the appearance transformation in the reference frame of the atlas. Rather than learning a separate inverse spatial transform model, in the future we will leverage existing work in diffeomorphic registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>.</p><p>We sample transformations from a discrete set of spatial and appearance transformations. This could be extended to span the space of transformations more richly, e.g., through interpolation between transformations, or using compositions of transformations.</p><p>We demonstrated our approach on brain MRIs. Since the method uses no brain-or MRI-specific information, it is feasible to extend it to other anatomy or imaging modalities, such as CT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a learning-based method for data augmentation, and demonstrated it on one-shot medical image segmentation.</p><p>We start with one labeled image and a set of unlabeled examples. Using learning-based registration methods, we model the set of spatial and appearance transformations between the labeled and unlabeled examples. These transformations capture effects such as non-linear deformations and variations in imaging intensity. We synthesize new labeled examples by sampling transformations and applying them <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Segmentation accuracy of each method across various brain structures. Labels are sorted by the volume occupied by each structure in the atlas (shown in parentheses), and labels consisting of left and right structures (e.g., Hippocampus) are combined. We abbreviate the labels: white matter (WM), cortex (CX), ventricle (vent), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Hippocampus segmentation predictions for two test subjects (rows). Our method (column 2) produces more accurate segmentations than the baselines (columns 3 and 4).</p><p>to the labeled example, producing a wide variety of realistic new images.</p><p>We use these synthesized examples to train a supervised segmentation model. The segmenter out-performs existing one-shot segmentation methods on every example in our test set, approaching the performance of a fully supervised model. This framework enables segmentation in many applications, such as clinical settings where time constraints permit the manual annotation of only a few scans.</p><p>In summary, this work shows that:</p><p>• learning independent models of spatial and appearance transformations from unlabeled images enables the synthesis of diverse and realistic labeled examples, and</p><p>• these synthesized examples can be used to train a segmentation model that out-performs existing methods in a one-shot scenario.</p></div>
