<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Building instance segmentation models that are dataefficient and can handle rare object categories is an important challenge in computer vision. Leveraging data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge. Here, we perform a systematic study of the Copy-Paste augmentation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>) for instance segmentation where we randomly paste objects onto an image. Prior studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training). On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate that Copy-Paste can lead to significant improvements on the LVIS benchmark. Our baseline model outperforms the LVIS 2020 Challenge winning entry by +3.6 mask AP on rare categories.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Instance segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> is an important task in computer vision with many real world applications. Instance segmentation models based on state-of-the-art convolutional networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> are often data-hungry. At the same time, annotating large datasets for instance segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> is usually expensive and timeconsuming. For example, 22 worker hours were spent per 1000 instance masks for COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. It is therefore imperative to develop new methods to improve the data-efficiency of state-of-the-art instance segmentation models. Here, we focus on data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> as a simple way to significantly improve the data-efficiency of instance segmentation models. Although many augmentation methods such as scale jittering and random resizing have been widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, they are more general-purpose in nature and have not been designed specifically for instance segmentation. An augmentation procedure that is more object-aware, both in terms of category and shape, is likely to be useful for instance segmentation. The Copy-Paste augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> is well suited for this need. By pasting diverse objects of various scales to new background images, Copy-Paste has the potential to create challenging and novel training data for free.</p><p>The key idea behind the Copy-Paste augmentation is to paste objects from one image to another image. This can lead to a combinatorial number of new training data, with <ref type="bibr">Figure 2</ref>. We use a simple copy and paste method to create new images for training instance segmentation models. We apply random scale jittering on two random training images and then randomly select a subset of instances from one image to paste onto the other image. multiple possibilities for: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> choices of the pair of source image from which instances are copied, and the target image on which they are pasted; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> choices of object instances to copy from the source image; (3) choices of where to paste the copied instances on the target image. The large variety of options when utilizing this data augmentation method allows for lots of exploration on how to use the technique most effectively. Prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> adopts methods for deciding where to paste the additional objects by modeling the surrounding visual context. In contrast, we find that a simple strategy of randomly picking objects and pasting them at random locations on the target image provides a significant boost on top of baselines across multiple settings. Specifically, it gives solid improvements across a wide range of settings with variability in backbone architecture, extent of scale jittering, training schedule and image size.</p><p>In combination with large scale jittering, we show that the Copy-Paste augmentation results in significant gains in the data-efficiency on COCO ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). In particular, we see a data-efficiency improvement of 2× over the commonly used standard scale jittering data augmentation. We also observe a gain of +10 Box AP on the low-data regime when using only 10% of the COCO training data.</p><p>We then show that the Copy-Paste augmentation strategy provides additional gains with self-training <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref> wherein we extract instances from ground-truth data and paste them onto unlabeled data annotated with pseudo-labels. Using an EfficientNet-B7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>  Finally, we show that the Copy-Paste augmentation results in better features for the two-stage training procedure typically used in the LVIS benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Using Copy-Paste we get improvements of 6.1 and 3.7 mask AP on the rare and common categories, respectively.</p><p>The Copy-Paste augmentation strategy is easy to plug into any instance segmentation codebase, can utilize unlabeled images effectively and does not create training or inference overheads. For example, our experiments with Mask-RCNN show that we can drop Copy-Paste into its training, and without any changes, the results can be easily improved, e.g., by +1.0 AP for 48 epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Data Augmentations. Compared to the volume of work on backbone architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> and detection/segmentation frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, relatively less attention is paid to data augmentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> in the computer vision community. Data augmentations such as random crop <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, color jittering <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, Auto/RandAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> have played a big role in achieving state-of-the-art results on image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, self-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and semi-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> on the ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> benchmark. These augmentations are more general purpose in nature and are mainly used for encoding invariances to data transformations, a principle well suited for image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Mixing Image Augmentations. In contrast to augmentations that encode invariances to data transformations, there exists a class of augmentations that mix the information contained in different images with appropriate changes to groundtruth labels. A classic example is the mixup data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> method which creates new data points for free from convex combinations of the input pixels and the output labels. There have been adaptations of mixup such as CutMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> that pastes rectangular crops of an image instead of mixing all pixels. There have also been applications of mixup and CutMix to object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The Mosaic data augmentation method employed in YOLO-v4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is related to CutMix in the sense that one creates a new compound image that is a rectangular grid of multiple individual images along with their ground truths. While mixup, CutMix and Mosaic are useful in combining multiple images or their cropped versions to create new training data, they are still not object-aware and have not been designed specifically for the task of instance segmentation.</p><p>Copy-Paste Augmentation. A simple way to combine information from multiple images in an object-aware manner is to copy instances of objects from one image and paste them onto another image. Copy-Paste is akin to mixup and CutMix but only copying the exact pixels corresponding to an object as opposed to all pixels in the object's bounding box. One key difference in our work compared to Contextual Copy-Paste <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and InstaBoost <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is that we do not need to model surrounding visual context to place the copied object instances. A simple random placement strategy works well and yields solid improvements on strong baseline models. Instaboost <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> differs from prior work on Copy-Paste <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> by not pasting instances from other images but rather by jiterring instances that already exist on the image. Cut-Paste-and-Learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposes to extract object instances, blend and paste them on diverse backgrounds and train on the augmented images in addition to the original dataset. Our work uses the same method with some differences: (1) We do not use geometric transformations (e.g. rotation), and find Gaussian blurring of the pasted instances not beneficial; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We study Copy-Paste in the context of pasting objects contained in one image into another image already populated with instances where <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> studies Copy-Paste in the context of having a bank of object instances and background scenes to improve performance; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> We study the efficacy of Copy-Paste in the semi-supervised learning setting by using it in conjunction with self-training. (4) We benchmark and thoroughly study Copy-Paste on the widely used COCO and LVIS datasets while Cut-Paste-and-Learn uses the GMU dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A key contribution is that our paper shows the use of Copy-Paste in improving state-ofthe-art instance segmentation models on COCO and LVIS.</p><p>Instance Segmentation. Instance segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> is a challenging computer vision problem that attempts to both detect object instances and segment the pixels corresponding to each instance. Mask-RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is a widely used framework with most state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> adopting that approach. The COCO dataset is the widely used benchmark for measuring progress. We report stateof-the-art 1 results on the COCO benchmark surpassing SpineNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by 2.8 AP and DetectoRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> by 0.6 AP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Long-Tail Visual Recognition. Recently, the computer vision community has begun to focus on the long-tail nature of object categories present in natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, where many of the different object categories have very few labeled images. Modern approaches for addressing longtail data when training deep networks can be mainly divided into two groups: data re-sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> and loss reweighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Other more complicated learning methods (e.g., meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, Bayesian methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, etc.) are also used to deal with long-tail data. Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> has pointed out the effectiveness of two-stage training strategies by separating the feature learning and the re-balancing stage, as end-to-end training with re-balancing strategies could be detrimental to feature learning. A more comprehensive summary of data imbalance in object detection can be found in Oksuz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Our work demonstrates simple Copy-Paste data augmentation yields significant gains in both single-stage and two-stage training on the LVIS benchmark, especially for rare object categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>Our approach for generating new data using Copy-Paste is very simple. We randomly select two images and apply random scale jittering and random horizontal flipping on each of them. Then we select a random subset of objects from one of the images and paste them onto the other image. Lastly, we adjust the ground-truth annotations accordingly: we remove fully occluded objects and update the masks and bounding boxes of partially occluded objects.</p><p>Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, we do not model the surrounding context and, as a result, generated images can look very different from real images in terms of co-occurrences of objects or related scales of objects. For example, giraffes and soccer players with very different scales can appear next to each other (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>Blending Pasted Objects. For composing new objects into an image, we compute the binary mask (α) of pasted objects using ground-truth annotations and compute the new image as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I 1 × α + I 2 × (1 − α)</formula><p>where I 1 is the pasted image and I 2 is the main image. To smooth out the edges of the pasted objects we apply a Gaussian filter to α similar to "blending"  in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. But unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we also found that simply composing without any blending has similar performance.</p><p>Large Scale Jittering. We use two different types of augmentation methods in conjunction with Copy-Paste throughout the text: standard scale jittering (SSJ) and large scale jittering (LSJ). These methods randomly resize and crop images. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for a graphical illustration of the two methods. In our experiments we observe that the large scale jittering yields significant performance improvements over the standard scale jittering used in most prior works.</p><p>Self-training Copy-Paste. In addition to studying Copy-Paste on supervised data, we also experiment with it as a way of incorporating additional unlabeled images. Our selftraining Copy-Paste procedure is as follows: (1) train a supervised model with Copy-Paste augmentation on labeled data, (2) generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data, (3) paste ground-truth instances into pseudo labeled and supervised labeled images and train a model on this new data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental Settings</head><p>Architecture. We use Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> with Efficient-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> or ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> as the backbone architecture. We also employ feature pyramid networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for multi-scale feature fusion. We use pyramid levels from P 2 to P 6 , with an anchor size of 8 × 2 l and 3 anchors per pixel. Our strongest model uses Cascade R-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, EfficientNet-B7 as the backbone and NAS-FPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as the feature pyramid with levels from P 3 to P 7 . The anchor size is 4 × 2 l and we have 9 anchors per pixel. Our NAS-FPN model uses 5 repeats and we replace convolution layers with ResNet bottleneck blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Training Parameters. All models are trained using synchronous batch normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> using a batch size of 256 and weight decay of 4e-5. We use a learning rate of 0.32 and a step learning rate decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. At the beginning of training the learning rate is linearly increased over the first 1000 steps from 0.0032 to 0.32. We decay the learning rate at 0.9, 0.95 and 0.975 fractions of the total number of training steps. We initialize the backbone of our largest model from an ImageNet checkpoint pre-trained with selftraining <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> to speed up the training. All other results are from models with random initialization unless otherwise stated. Also, we use large scale jittering augmentation for training the models unless otherwise stated. For all different augmentations and dataset sizes in our experiments we allow each model to train until it converges (i.e., the validation set performance no longer improves). For example, training a model from scratch with large scale jittering and Copy-Paste augmentation requires 576 epochs while training with only standard scale jittering takes 96 epochs. For the self-training experiments we double the batch size to 512 while we keep all the other hyper-parameters the same with the exception of our largest model where we retain the batch size of 256 due to memory constraints.</p><p>Dataset. We use the COCO dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> which has 118k training images. For self-training experiments, we use the unlabeled COCO dataset (120k images) and the Ob-jects365 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> (610k images) as unlabeled images. For transfer learning experiments, we pre-train our models on the COCO dataset and then fine-tune on the Pascal VOC dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For semantic segmentation, we train our models on the train set (1.5k images) of the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation dataset. For detection, we train on the trainval set of PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012. We also benchmark Copy-Paste on the LVIS v1.0 (100k training images) and report results on LVIS v1.0 val (20k images). LVIS has 1203 classes to simulate the longtail distribution of classes in natural images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Copy-Paste is robust to training configurations</head><p>In this section we show that Copy-Paste is a strong data augmentation method that is robust across a variety of training iterations, models and training hyperparameters.</p><p>Robustness to backbone initialization. Common practice for training Mask R-CNN is to initialize the backbone with an ImageNet pre-trained checkpoint. However He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Zoph et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> show that a model trained from random initialization has similar or better performance with longer training. Training models from Ima-geNet pre-training with strong data-augmentation (i.e. Ran-dAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) was shown to hurt the performance by up to 1 AP on COCO. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> (left) demonstrates that Copy-Paste is additive in both setups and we get the best result using Copy-Paste augmentation and random initialization.</p><p>Robustness to training schedules. A typical training schedule for Mask R-CNN in the literature is only 24 (2×) or 36 epochs (3×) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. However, recent work with state-of-the-art results show that longer training is helpful in training object detection models on COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows that we get gains from Copy-Paste for the typical training schedule of 2× or 3× and as we increase training epochs the gain increases. This shows that Copy-Paste is a very practical data augmentation since we do not need a longer training schedule to see the benefit.</p><p>Copy-Paste is additive to large scale jittering augmentation. Random scale jittering is a powerful data augmentation that has been used widely in training computer vision models. The standard range of scale jittering in the literature is 0.8 to 1.25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. However, augmenting data with larger scale jittering with a range of 0.1 to 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and longer training significantly improves performance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, right plot). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates that Copy-Paste is additive to both standard and large scale jittering augmentation and we get a higher boost on top of standard scale jittering. On the other hand, as it is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, mixup <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> data augmentation does not help when it is used with large scale jittering.</p><p>Copy-Paste works across backbone architectures and image sizes. Finally, we demonstrate Copy-Paste helps models with standard backbone architectures of ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> as well the more recent architecture of EfficientNet-B7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. We train models with these backbones on the image size of 640×640, 1024×1024 or 1280×1280. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows that we get significant improvements over the strong baselines trained with large scale jittering for all the models. Across 6 models with different backbones and images sizes Copy-Paste gives on average a 1.3 box AP and 0.8 mask AP improvement on top of large scale jittering.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Copy-Paste and self-training are additive</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate that a standard selftraining method similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref> and Copy-Paste can be combined together to leverage unlabeled data. Copy-Paste and self-training individually have similar gains of 1.5 box AP over the baseline with 48.5 Box AP (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p><p>To combine self-training and Copy-Paste we first use a supervised teacher model trained with Copy-Paste to generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data. Next we take ground truth objects from COCO and paste them into pseudo labeled images and COCO images. Finally, we train the student model on all these images. With this setup we achieve 51.4 box AP, an improvement of 2.9 AP over the baseline.</p><p>Data to Paste on. In our self-training setup, half of the batch is from supervised COCO data (120k images) and the other half is from pseudo labeled data (110k images from unlabeled COCO and 610k from Objects365). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> presents results when we paste COCO instances on different portions of the training images. Pasting into pseudo labeled data yields larger improvements compared to pasting into COCO. Since the number of images in the pseudo labeled set is larger, using images with more variety as background helps Copy-Paste. We get the maximum gain over self-training (+1.4 box AP and +1.0 mask AP) when we paste COCO instances on both COCO and pseudo labeled images.</p><p>Data to Copy from. We also explore an alternative way to use Copy-Paste to incorporate extra data by pasting pseudo labeled objects from an unlabeled dataset directly into the COCO labeled dataset. Unfortunately, this setup shows no additional AP improvements compared with pasting COCO ground-truth objects.</p></div>

Our baseline model is a Cascade Mask-RCNN with EfficientNet-B7 backbone and NAS-FPN. We observe an improvement of +1.2 box AP and +0.5 mask AP using Copy-Paste. When combined with self-training using unlabeled COCO and unlabeled Objects365 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> for pseudo-labeling, we see a further improvement of 2.5 box AP and 2.2 mask AP, resulting in a model with a strong performance of 57.3 box AP and 49.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev without test-time augmentations and model ensembling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Copy-Paste provides strong gains on LVIS</head><p>We benchmark Copy-Paste on the LVIS dataset to see how it performs on a dataset with a long-tail distribution of 1203 classes. There are two different training paradigms typically used for the LVIS benchmark: (1) single-stage where a detector is trained directly on the LVIS dataset, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> two-stage where the model from the first stage is fine-tuned with class re-balancing losses to help handle the class imbalance.</p><p>Copy-Paste improves single-stage LVIS training. The single-stage training paradigm is quite similar to our Copy-Paste setup on COCO. In addition to the standard training setup certain methods are used to handle the class imblance problem on LVIS. One common method is Repeat Factor Sampling (RFS) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, with t = 0.001. This method aims at helping the large class imbalance problem on LVIS by over-sampling images that contain rare classes. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> shows the results of applying Copy-Paste on a strong singlestage LVIS baseline. We use EfficientNet-B7 FPN with 640×640 input size, and train the model from scratch with random initialization for 180k steps using 256 batch size. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we increase the number of detections per image to 300 and reduce the score threshold to 0. We observe that Copy-Paste augmentation outperforms RFS on AP, AP c and AP f , but under-performs on AP r (the AP for rare classes). The best overall result comes from combining RFS and Copy-Paste augmentation, achieving a boost of +2.4 AP and +8.7 AP r .</p><p>Copy-Paste improves two-stage LVIS training. Twostage training is widely adopted to address data imbalance and obtain good performance on LVIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. We aim to study the efficacy of Copy-Paste in this twostage setup. Our two-stage training is as follows: first we train the object detector with standard training techniques (i.e., same as our single-stage training) and then we finetune the model trained in the first stage using the Class-Balanced Loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The weight for a class is calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1 − β)/(1 − β n ),</formula><p>where n is the number of instances of the class and β = 0.999. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> During the second stage finetuning, we train the model with 3× schedule and only update the final classification layer in Mask R-CNN using the classification loss. From mask AP results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 9</ref>, we can see models trained with Copy-Paste learn better features for low-shot classes (+2.3 on AP r and +2.6 on AP c ). Interestingly, we find RFS, which is quite helpful and additive with Copy-Paste in single-stage training, hurts the performance in two-stage training. A possible explanation for this finding is that features learned with RFS are worse than those learned with the original LVIS dataset. We leave a more detailed investigation of the tradeoffs between RFS and data augmentations in two stage training for future work.</p><p>Comparison with the state-of-the-art.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Data augmentation is at the heart of many vision systems. In this paper, we rigorously studied the Copy-Paste data augmentation method, and found that it is very effective and robust. Copy-Paste performs well across multiple experimental settings and provides significant improvements on top of strong baselines, both on the COCO and LVIS instance segmentation benchmarks.</p><p>The Copy-Paste augmentation strategy is simple, easy to plug into any instance segmentation codebase, and does not increase the training cost or inference time. We also showed that Copy-Paste is useful for incorporating extra unlabeled images during training and is additive on top of successful self-training techniques. We hope that the convincing empirical evidence of its benefits make Copy-Paste augmentation a standard augmentation procedure when training instance segmentation models.</p></div>
