<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As an important part of speech recognition technology, automatic speech keyword recognition has been intensively studied in recent years. Such technology becomes especially pivotal under situations with limited infrastructures and computational resources, such as voice command recognition in vehicles and robot interaction. At present, the mainstream methods in automatic speech keyword recognition are based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanism. However, due to inevitable information losses for the LSTM layer caused during feature extraction, the calculated attention weights are biased. In this paper, a novel approach, namely Multi-layer Attention Mechanism, is proposed to handle the inaccurate attention weights problem. The key idea is that, in addition to the conventional attention mechanism, information of layers prior to feature extraction and LSTM are introduced into attention weights calculations. Therefore, the attention weights are more accurate because the overall model can have more precise and focused areas. We conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis on the keyword spotting performances on convolution neural network, bi-directional LSTM cyclic neural network, and cyclic neural network with the proposed attention mechanism on Google Speech Command datasets V2 datasets. Experimental results indicate favorable results for the proposed method and demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The proposed multilayer attention methods can be useful for other researches related to object spotting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â…  Introduction</head><p>Traditional automatic speech recognition usually focusses on the recognition of an entire paragraph or passage of speech. Therefore, traditional speech recognition models usually need a vast amount of memory and computation resources. The huge sample size, together with the large memory cost and complex calculations occupied by the model, make traditional speech recognition hard to be proceeded when the resource is scarce. For example, in scenarios where there is no external computational resource and a microcontroller is the core of computing, traditional automatic speech recognition models become impossible to be used. As an alternative option, automatic speech keyword recognition technology has been paid more and more attention. In recent years, automatic speech keyword recognition technology has been applied to the aforementioned scenarios, and has produced positive outcomes on the performances. Key challenges in the technology of speech keywords recognition exist mainly in the confusing noise from the high-variance speech characteristics without sematic meanings, such as different pronunciation colors and habits, speech cohesion, and ambiguous boundary between pronunciation units. Among the methods to overcome these problems, recurrent neural networks with attention mechanism has demonstrated promising capabilities. With explicit attention, recurrent neural networks are able to focus on the speech parts with clear sematic meaning and resist the impact of noise.</p><p>Conventional attention-based recurrent neural networks, mainly developed from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), use the output of the last layer Preprint. Work in process.</p><p>to perform attention. However, in the application of Speech Recognition, the features are usually extracted as spectrogram or cepstrum, and the attention mechanism based on the last output will be insufficient. In this paper, to improve the performance of speech keyword recognition, a new attention model has been proposed. The new model considers attention mechanism on each level of the recurrent neural network, and leverages potential information especially from the feature layers.</p><p>Two datasets under four scenarios are tested based on the proposed multi-level attention recurrent neural network with multi-level output synergy. And for the purpose of comparison, the same experiment is performed on convolutional neural network, bidirectional recurrent neural network (Cyclic LSTM), and recurrent neural network with conventional attention model (Circulating LSTM).</p><p>Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model is consistently better than the compared counterparts. In addition, the proposed method in the paper has a better performance consistency: the performance of each test set is almost the same, and the reduction of individual keyword recognition rate is relatively low, which has a certain practical value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Related Work</head><p>Using deep Neural Network and attention mechanism in Speech Recognition has been a long-time practice in the research community. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the Gaussian mixture model and hidden Markov model are extended using the high-renowned feature extraction ability of deep neural network to supplement the deficiency of the original feature extraction model. By using 2000 hours of "SWB + Fisher" data set for training, the final error rate reached 13.8%. At the same time, Alex Graves also combines the Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model with LSTM unit of the cyclic neural network, and finds that the frame accuracy of the combined speech has been greatly improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Igor Szoke simplifies the model, divides it into keyword model and background filling model, and calculates the maximum likelihood ratio in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, Ossama Abdel-Hamid uses convolutional neural network and weight sharing to recognize multi-keyword speech.

Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> conducted a work similar to this paper, which applied neural attention specifically for keyword recognition. However, it did not consider the multilayer attention system proposed by this paper.</p></div>

Therefore, we can choose to use Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients for audio preprocessing. Mel cepstrum is a spectrum representing short-term audio. Its principle is linear cosine conversion based on logarithmic spectrum represented by non-linear Mel scale, and Mel cepstrum coefficient is a set of coefficients used to establish Mel cepstrum. The extraction process of coefficients is mainly composed of the following four steps.</p><p>(1) Using framing, pre-emphasis and windowing to the original audio.</p><p>(2) Using Fourier transform to process audio.

For the vanilla encoderdecoder model, the output pays the same attention to each input after encoding, which could weight some noise as equally important to rich-sematic information and adversely affect the performance. Thus, the attention mechanism will make the system more attentive and devote more attention to the input it needs to pay attention to. In this paper, attention mechanism is introduced on the basis of bi-directional LSTM recurrent neural network. We trust that double-stacked LSTM recurrent neural network carries enough memory information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Mechanism</head><p>Stemming from the application of machine translation, conventional circular neural network model with attention mechanism is based on extracting the output vector of the last LSTM layer, using dense layer projection and querying the vector to identify which part of the audio is most relevant.</p><p>But when transferring to speech recognition, one significant problem will arise: the calculation of attention weights is solely based on output of the LSTM layer, and the input of LSTM is proceeded by Meyer Cepstrum (pre-processing) and extracted by convolution layer (feature extraction), which introduce information distortion inevitably. That is to say, certain important knowledge from previous layers are likely ignored, and the information in the attention mechanism might have biases.</p><p>Therefore, if the input of attention mechanism can be changed from only using the output layer of LSTM to the collaborative output of multiple layers in the overall process, it might be helpful for conquering the inaccurate attention weights problem. In this paper, a novel approach, namely Multi-layer Attention Mechanism, is proposed to handle the inaccurate attention weights problem. The key idea is that information of layers prior feature extraction and prior LSTM layer are also introduced into calculating attention weights. Therefore, the memory of the problem will be corrected and supplemented to improve the accuracy of keyword recognition.</p><p>The idea of the Multi-layer Attention model is visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref> and a detailed description is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.  It can be seen that the semantic encoding of input information at this time is not only related to the encoding mode, but also directly affected by the input. Therefore, the information carried is closer to the input information.</p><p>Compared with the previous attention mechanism model, multi-level attention mechanism model will be affected by different levels of output synergy, and ultimately achieve After transferring the parameters to the output layer of LSTM, the memory information with attention weight assignment is obtained, which is eventually output to the full connection layer. The structure of the network model is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. The maximum number of cycles Epoch is 40 and the batch size is 64.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a)Accuracy of training set and test set</head><p>The circular neural network with attention mechanism has accelerated the convergence, but the improvement on spotting accuracy is relatively insignificant. After a comprehensive analysis of the results on the test set, it is found that the LSTM circular neural network, with explicit attention or not, suffer most significantly from a low recognition rate for individual words. And in order to make the recognition rate of keyword model higher, this paper does it on the basis of the above model. Some improvements were made to improve the recognition rate of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Result on Multi-layer Attention LSTM</head><p>Like the previous network, in order to avoid the program falling into gradient explosion or making meaningless calculation without gradient, the decision of early stopping is added to the training, and the best-  Through the later verification, it is proved that the speech recognition model with attention feature has good performance on different test sets, and the recognition rate without keywords is very low, which is in line with our assumption.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">preserved</formula><p>Preprint. Work in process.</p><p>To further analyze the insight of the results based on multi-layer attention, the histogram of spotting accuracy of the 20 keywords is plotted as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>. From the results of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 11</ref>, the recognition accuracy of each word is above 93%, except the 'down' command has a lower recognition rate of 89.2% (slightly lower than 90%). The overall recognition rate is 95.07%, which is 0.7% higher than that of the previous model with attention mechanism, and the accuracy is further improved.</p><p>In order to reduce the phenomenon that the recognition rate of individual keywords is too low in the above models, this paper also proposes a cyclic neural network model with attention features to solve the above problems. The histogram of the recognition accuracy of 20 keywords using the cyclic neural network model with attention features is as follows:</p><p>The recognition rate of the model is 93.72%. Although the recognition rate is lower than that of the cyclic neural network model and the multi-layer attention mechanism model, we can see from the above figure that there is basically no keyword recognition rate is relatively low, and there is no keyword recognition rate less than 90%. In addition, we use other sample databases and test sets to validate the data set, and find that the performance of the model is relatively stable, and the performance on other data sets is better than that on this data set.</p></div>

The accuracy and loss function of the training set and the test set in the training process are stored under the condition that the parameters and the optimizer are set unchanged, as shown in Figure 10. The accuracy rate of bidirectional LSTM cyclic neural network on val-test set is 94.34%, which is much higher than that of the CNN-based method. However, excessive accumulation of LSTM units for assistant memory may cause degradation problems, which may lead to slow training speed or even stop training. The third tested model, namely Circulating Neural Network with Attention Mechanism, could deal with the above problem and improve the recognition accuracy. In this model, the pre-processed data are imported into the Attention Mechanism model for training, and the accuracy and loss function of the training set and the test set in the training process are stored with the parameters and optimizer unchanged. The drawing comparison is shown in</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_13"><head>Fig. 9</head><label>9</label><figDesc>Loss function and accuracy curve of keyword recognition model with multi-layer attention mechanism After the model was built, the number of samples was 8484849, and there were 20 keywords. Similarly, the maximum number of cycles Epoch was 40, and the batch_size was 64. Like the previous network, in order to avoid the program falling into gradient explosion or making meaningless calculation without gradient, the decision of early stopping is added to the training, and the bestpreserved model is selected. The model is optimized by using Adam optimizer and learning rate attenuation. The accuracy and loss functions of the training set and test set of each cycle in the training process are stored and compared as follows.</figDesc></figure>

The model is optimized by using Adam optimizer with learning rate attenuation. It can be seen that the accuracy of the test set at the end of the first Epoch is 0.87933, the loss function of the test set is 0.4332, the running time of each step is 149 ms, and the running time of each cycle is 198 seconds; the accuracy of the test set in the eleventh cycle is 0.95030, and the loss function of the test set is 0.2291. In the 21st cycle, the test set has not exceeded the accuracy of 11 cycles, so the trigger lift is triggered. Early_stop, end the loop.</figDesc><table><row><cell>(a)Accuracy of training set and test set</cell></row><row><cell>(b)Test Set and Training Set Loss Function</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
