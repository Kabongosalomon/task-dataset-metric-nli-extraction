<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Self-Supervised Learning. Self-supervised learning methods strive to learn informative data representations by defining and solving a pretext task. In these tasks, pseudo labels can be generated automatically and compact data representations must be learned in order to solve these tasks. Many pretext tasks were proposed in recent years: colorizing grayscale images <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zhang, Isola, and Efros 2016)</ref>, image jigsaw puzzle <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Noroozi and Favaro 2016)</ref>, image inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pathak et al. 2016)</ref>, video frame order verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Misra, Zitnick, and Hebert 2016)</ref>, video future prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vondrick, Pirsiavash, and Torralba 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srivastava, Mansimov, and Salakhudinov 2015)</ref>, audio-visual correspondence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Korbar, Tran, and Torresani 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arandjelovic and Zisserman 2017)</ref>, speechvisual correspondence <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miech et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Miech et al. , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amrani et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moriya et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun et al. 2019b,a)</ref>, etc. In this work, we focus on speech-visual correspondence in unlabeled instructional videos, where speech is converted to text using an automatic speech recognition system. Speech-visual correspondence is considered a difficult pretext task due to extremely noisy pseudo labels, yet it can be a highly advantageous task since it provides semantic information of visual features in the form of natural text. Such valuable information can be utilized to solve many challenging multimodal downstream tasks as we show in Section 6.</p><p>Multimodal Representation Learning. The word modality refers to a particular form of sensory perception, such as the visual and auditory modalities. A machine learning task or dataset is said to be multimodal when it includes a number of modalities. Multimodal representation learning frameworks can be divided into three types: (a) joint representation which aims to learn a shared semantic subspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Salakhutdinov and Hinton 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Srivastava and Salakhutdinov 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antol et al. 2015)</ref>; (b) an encoder-decoder framework which aims to translate from one modality into another and keep their semantics consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mao et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Venugopalan et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reed et al. 2016)</ref>; and (c) coordinated representation which aims to learn separated yet coordinated representations for each modality under some constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Weston, Bengio, and Usunier 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Frome et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Socher et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wang, Li, and Lazebnik 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vendrov et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tian, Krishnan, and Isola 2019)</ref>. In this work, we focus on coordinated representations that enforce similarity among them. Our goal is to enforce the multimodal representations of similar 'concepts' to be close to each other. E.g., a video of a man running on the beach should be close in representation to the textual representation of 'a man running on the beach' as opposed to 'a man cooking in the kitchen'. The multimodal representation described above is highly valuable for solving multimodal machine learning tasks. If a machine learning model learns to link between the visuals and text of specific concepts it should be able, for example, to answer natural language questions about visual content, or do cross-modal retrieval more easily (Section 5.2).</p><p>Density Estimation. The aim of density estimation is to estimate the probability density function underlying the data, which is assumed to be i.i.d. Existing density estimation algorithms can be divided into two categories: (a) parametric or semi-parametric approaches such as Gaussian Mixture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McLachlan and Krishnan 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wang and Wang 2015)</ref> and probabilistic graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Koller and Friedman 2009)</ref>; and (b) non-parametric approaches such as histograms, Splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Stone 1994)</ref>, neural network-based density estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Uria, Murray, and Larochelle 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Papamakarios, Pavlakou, and Murray 2017)</ref> and Kernel Density Estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Silverman 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Terrell and Scott 1992)</ref>. For an extended review on density estimation for high-dimensional data see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wang and Scott 2019)</ref>. In this work, we utilize multimodal k-Nearest Neighbor density estimation, which is a special case of Kernel Density Estimation. With it, we form a novel noise-robust multimodal representation learning model.</p><p>Learning with Noisy Data. Learning with noisy data can be divided into two approaches: (a) formulating explicit or implicit noise models to characterize the distribution of noisy and true labels using neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goldberger and Ben-Reuven 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jiang et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sukhbaatar et al. 2015)</ref>, graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Xiao et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. 2017)</ref>, etc. and (b) using correction methods. E.g., relabeling the data during training <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Reed et al. 2015)</ref>, jointly optimizing the model's parameters and estimating true labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Tanaka et al. 2018</ref>), using noise-tolerant loss function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ghosh, Kumar, and Sastry 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Van Rooyen, Menon, and Williamson 2015)</ref> or noise tolerant training algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Li et al. 2019</ref>). However, these methods do not deal with multimodal association label (Definition 1) and often require a small set of data with clean labels to be available. In this work, we propose a true label estimation method for multimodal data that does not require availability of clean labels. We base our estimation on the correlation between modalities alone.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Motivation</head><p>In multimodal data, a sample is said to be noisy when two or more modalities do not share the same semantic meaning. For example, a video-text pair that is associated with each other, yet the text is not related to the ongoing visuals. Existing multimodal embedding models are susceptible to such noisy data, i.e., the model is likely to adjust itself to the noise in the data and thus yield sub-optimal results. This scenario is very common in the case of self-supervised multimodal learning and even when learning from unlabeled instructional videos. Although in these instructional videos there is some correlation between caption (speech transcription) and vision, unfortunately often a person is talking about something that is not present visually. For example, in the HowTo100M dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miech et al. 2019)</ref>, the authors manually inspected 400 randomly sampled clip-caption pairs and found that in about half there was not a single object or action mentioned in the caption that was also visually present in the video clip. To deal with noise, we suggest to utilize the inherent correlation between the different modalities that is based on the Definition and Assumption below. See <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> for a visualization and a detailed explanation. Definition 1. A correctly (wrongly) associated pair is a clipcaption pair (v, c) that share (do not share) the same semantic meaning or concept, i.e., the caption c describes (does not describe) the ongoing visuals v. Assumption 1 (Mixture Model). The distributions of the videos and captions can be represented using a general mixture model of T components in the corresponding modality.</p><p>Denoting by a, b ∈ {1, . . . , T }, respectively, the concept to which the video v and the caption c belong, we can write v|a ∼ p v (v|a) and c|b ∼ p c (c|b).</p><p>If Assumption 1 holds, then correctly associated pairs form dense clusters in both modalities that contain pairs that are also associated with each other (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>). Thus, by defining a multimodal similarity function (i.e., a similarity measure between pairs), we can formulate the task of finding correctly associated pairs simply as a multimodal density estimation task. In this formulation, pairs in dense areas will be more likely to be correctly associated, while pairs in sparse areas will be more likely to be wrongly associated (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref>).</p></div>

We call it Soft Max Margin Ranking:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L sof t−rank = i∈P p i j∈Ni max{0, s ij − s ii + δ}+ max{0, s ji − s ii + δ} , (4)</formula><p>where, P is the set of noisy associated (positive) pairs, N i is the set of negative pairs for clip-caption pair (v i , c i ),p i is defined in (2), s ij is the similarity score between the embedding of the clip-caption pair (f v (v i ), f c (c j )), and δ is the margin. The first term in the equation above is for matching a video with a negative caption and the second term is for matching a caption with a negative video. We note that a different integration approach is to discard samples withp i below a certain threshold. However, for real-data experiments we found the performance to be substantially worse.</p></div>

Each initial monomodal embedding space contains somewhat dense clusters of 'concepts', where a 'concept' could be a specific object or action (e.g., <ref type="bibr">'cutting', 'knife', 'check', 'tire', 'oven', etc.)</ref>. It is likely that correctly associated (Definition 1) pairs form dense clusters in both modalities that contain pairs that are also associated with each other and of the same 'concept' (GREEN, z1 -z6, z9 -z11). In contrast, a wrongly associated (Definition 1) pair may still belong to dense clusters in both modalities but those clusters are not likely to contain pairs that are associated with each other (RED, z7 and z8).

While, from the first glance, this assumption might severely limit the possible configurations of the concepts in each of the modalities, in our analysis we made no assumptions whatsoever on the way the concepts are collocated in space, except the 6σ-separation that can hold in any number of dimensions. The validity of the presented analysis in the multidimensional case is corroborated by the toy dataset example in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Numerical Simulations and Analysis</head><p>In this section, we present numerical simulations of the probabilistic error bounds in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(5)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">(6)</ref>. Our goal is to gain insight into: (a) why the method works; (b) the effect of the design choice (K) and dataset properties (η, M, T ) on the performance of the model; and (c) analyze possible failure cases. More specifically, we: (a) set τ = τ * such that P (S i ≥ τ * | p i = 0) = P (S i ≤ τ * | p i = 1), i.e., τ * = MS i | pi=0 (t) · MS i | pi=1 (−t); (b) sweep a single parameter at a time, while the rest are fixed; and (c) optimize for t over <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>.</p><p>Discussion. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2a</ref> we study the effect of K. As expected, increasing K decreases the error bound initially and from a certain value ( K 0 ), the error bound increases. Not surprisingly, K 0 ≈ M T · (1 − η), which is the average number of correctly associated pairs per concept. Throughout <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures  2a, 2b, 2c, 2d</ref> we see the error bound is influenced greatly by this equality, i.e., when K &gt; K 0 , the model performs well and when K ≤ K 0 , it starts to fail. Specifically, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  2c</ref> we show that the error bound goes to zero as the size of the dataset (M ) increases (another point of view is that K 0 is increased). For this reason we mark the point where KT = M (1−η) by a red dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>. It is clear that for real-world data, concepts are usually not equi-probable and thus assigning a global value for K is sub-optimal. However, this finding allows us to better understand such failure cases and thus choose a reasonable K value. An additional instance where the method fails, gives us insight into why usually the method succeeds. The method will fail for a small number of concepts (T ) regardless of K 0 , because for a small number of concepts there is a higher chance that two or more wrongly associated pairs belong to the same pair of concepts in both modalities.

We train our model using the HowTo100M <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miech et al. 2019</ref>) narrated video dataset that consists of more than 1.2M videos accompanied with automatically generated speech transcription. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miech et al. 2019)</ref>, we use the provided transcription to create pairs of clip-caption defined by each caption time stamp, where each video clip shorter than 5 seconds is extended symmetrically in time so that the duration is at least 5 seconds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Downstream Tasks</head><p>Video Visual Question Answering (VQA). The Video VQA task comprises answering questions about videos presented in natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Antol et al. 2015)</ref>. Essentially, an instance of VQA includes an input video and a free-form textual query regarding the content in the video, and an expected textual answer. To accommodate this task we fine-tune our learned multimodal representations and evaluate our model on two datasets: MSRVTT-QA and MSVD-QA <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Xu et al. 2017)</ref>. These datasets are based on existing video description datasets. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5a</ref> in Appendix G for detailed statistics of each dataset.</p><p>Most VQA models use a video and question as input, and the answer is presented as the output of an LSTM unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997)</ref> or a softmax layer over a set of predetermined answers. However, these types of architectures do not fully utilize the information which exists in coordinated representations, i.e., the representation of the correct answer might likely be closely embedded to the visual representation, given the question. To better utilize our learned multimodal representations specifically for the VQA task, we use a similar architecture to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hu, Chao, and Sha 2018)</ref>, but for video. We learn two more sets of embeddings on top of the pre-trained embeddings that were learned with the HowTo100M dataset: a question+video embedding, i.e., we embed a concatenation of the question and video to a single feature vector; and an answer embedding. We train the model with a max margin ranking loss function to embed an answer close to its question+video. Inference is performed simply with a nearest neighbor search over the set of predetermined answers in the joint video+question and answer space. This model is very simple compared to most VQA models, yet as we show in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> it is very powerful when built on effective self-supervised pre-trained joint embeddings.</p><p>Text-To-Video Retrieval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Summary</head><p>In this work, we showed that the problem of noise estimation in multimodal data can be effectively reduced to a multimodal density estimation task. Based on this efficient noise estimation we proposed a novel building block for noise robust multimodal representation learning that can be integrated into many multimodal learning models and improve their performance instantly. We demonstrated how to integrate our building block into the max margin ranking loss function (Soft Max Margin) and it can similarly be integrated into various architectures and losses. We trained Soft Max Margin on the self-supervised proxy task of speechvisual correspondence that is known to be highly noisy. We further evaluated Soft Max Margin on two different downstream tasks: Visual Question Answering and Text-to-Video Retrieval; and achieved comparable state-of-the-art performance on five different datasets. For supporting the empirical results and analyzing failure cases, we provided a theoretical probabilistic error bound. These results emphasize the importance of self-supervised multimodal representation learning for advancing the state of the art in challenging multimodal artificial intelligence tasks.</p></div>

We note that across all sub-figures in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, similar trends are observed in comparison to the theoretical graphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and Fig. 8</ref>. More specifically, across <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>, 4b, 4c, 4d we observe the influence of K0 (mentioned in Section 4) on the performance of our suggested approach. Additionally, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4e</ref>, we observe the same 'low T failure case' mentioned in Section 4.  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Empirical error of multidimensional toy dataset. In the figures above we empirically reproduce the theoretical graphs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2 and Fig. 8</ref> using the multidimensional toy dataset mentioned above. The results help in validating that the analysis that was done in Thm. 1 for a single dimension, also holds for a multidimensional space. The vertical axis is (1 − precision), where the threshold was chosen such that F1 Score is maximized. In each figure we mark with a red dashed vertical line the point at which the equation K = M T · (1 − η) holds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1 High Score Examples and Their k Nearest Neighbours</head><p>In this section, we present two examples of clip-caption pairs with highp (see Eq. (2)) and their nearest neighbours in the multimodal space that contributed to their high score. One example includes in its caption the word 'bye' <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>) and the other the word 'mix' <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig 6)</ref>. The figures below include only one representative frame from each video clip. Thus, it is worth mentioning that all video clips in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5 and 6</ref> in fact contain a 'waiving goodbye' action and a 'mixing' action, respectively. It is important to note that these examples were extracted only based on our noise estimation component and are not based on the learned shared embedding space.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Low T Failure Case Simulation</head><p>One instance where the method fails, gives us insight into why usually the method succeeds. The method will fail for a small number of concepts (T ) and regardless of K0, because for a small number of concepts there is a higher chance that two or more wrongly associated pairs belong to the same pair of concepts in both modalities. Fortunately, in real-world data T is almost always large, and additionally as T increases this problem is alleviated by a factor of O(T 2 ) (see Appendix A, Eq. (10)). A simulation of this case is presented in the figure below. </p></div>
