<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Documents can be analyzed as sequences of hierarchical discourse structures. Discourse structures describe the organization of documents in terms of discourse or rhetorical relations. For instance, the three discourse units below can be represented by the tree in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, where a relation COMPAR-ISON holds between the segments 1 and 2, and a relation ATTRIBUTION links the segment covering the units 1 and 2, and the segment 3. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mann and Thompson, 1988)</ref> is a prominent linguistic theory of discourse structures, in which texts are analyzed as constituency trees, such as the one in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. This theory guided the annotation of the RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)  for English, from which several textlevel discourse parsers have been induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hernault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Joty et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feng and Hirst, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>. Such parsers have proven to be useful for various downstream applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daumé III and Marcu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burstein et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Higgins et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thione et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sporleder and Lapata, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Taboada and Mann, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Louis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhatia et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There are discourse treebanks for other languages than English, including Spanish, German, Basque, Dutch, and Brazilian Portuguese. However, most research experimenting with these languages has focused on rule-based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pardo and Nunes, 2008;</ref> or has been limited to intra-sentential relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maziero et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, all discourse corpora are limited in size, since annotation is complex and time consuming. This data sparsity makes learning hard, especially considering that discourse parsing involves several complex and interacting factors, ranging from syntax and semantics, to pragmat-ics. We thus propose to harmonize existing corpora in order to leverage information by combining datasets in different languages.</p><p>Contributions In this paper, we propose a new discourse parser that is significantly better than existing parsers for English on 2/3 standard metrics. Our parser relies on fewer features than previous work and is arguably algorithmically simpler. Moreover, we present the first end-to-end statistical discourse parsers for other languages than English (6 languages, in total). We also present the first experiments in cross-lingual discourse parsers, showing that discourse parsing is possible even when no or very little labeled data is available for the language of interest. We do so by harmonizing available discourse treebanks, enabling us to apply models across languages. We make the code and preprocessing scripts available for download at https://bitbucket.org/ chloebt/discourse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The first text-level discourse parsers were developed for English, relying mainly on hand-crafted rules and heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Marcu, 2000a;</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hernault et al. (2010, HILDA)</ref> greedily use SVM classifiers to make attachment and labeling decisions, building up a discourse tree. <ref type="bibr">Joty et al. (2012, TSP)</ref> build a two-stage parsing system, training separate sequential models (CRF) for the intra-and the inter-sentential levels. These models jointly learn the relation and the structure, and a CKY-like algorithm is used to find the optimal tree. Feng and Hirst (2014) use CRFs only as local models for the inter-and intra-sententials levels. For Brazilian Portuguese, for example, the first system, called DiZer <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pardo and Nunes, 2008;</ref>, was also rule-based, but there has been some work on using classification of intra-sentential relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maziero et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Recently studies have focused on building good representations of the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feng and Hirst (2012)</ref> introduced linguistic features, mostly syntactic and contextual ones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al. (2014)</ref> used a recursive neural network that builds a representation for each clause based on the syntactic tree, and then apply two classifiers as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hernault et al. (2010)</ref>. This leads to the best performing system for unlabeled structure (85.0 in F 1 ). The system presented by <ref type="bibr">Ji and Eisenstein (2014, DPLP)</ref> jointly learns the representation and the task: a large mar-gin classifier is used to learn the actions of a shiftreduce parser, optimizing at the same time the loss of the parser and a projection matrix that maps the bag-of-word representation of the discourse units into a new vector space. This system, however, only slightly outperforms the original bag-of-word representation. DPLP is the best performing discourse parser for labeled structure, 71.13 in F 1 for nuclearity and 61.63% for relation.</p><p>Our system is similar to these last approaches in learning a representation using a neural network. However, we found that good performance can already be obtained without using all the words in the discourse units, resulting in a parser that is faster and easier to adapt, as demonstrated in our multilingual experiments, see Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RST framework</head><p>Discourse analysis In building a discourse structure, the text is first segmented into elementary discourse units (EDU), mostly clauses. EDUs are the smallest discourse units (DUs). Discourse relations are then used to build DUs, recursively. A non-elementary DU is called a complex discourse unit (CDU). The structure of a document is the set of linked DUs. In this paper, we focus on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), a theoretical framework proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mann and Thompson (1988)</ref>.</p><p>Nuclearity A DU is either a nucleus or a satellite, the nucleus being the most important part of the relation (i.e. of the text), while the satellite contains additional, less important information. In general, this feature depends on the relation: a relation can be either mono-nuclear (with a scheme nucleus-satellite or satellite-nucleus depending on the relative order of the spans), or multi-nuclear. Some relations can be either monoor multi-nuclear, such as consequence or evaluation in the RST-DT.</p><p>Binary trees In the original RST framework, each relation is associated with an application scheme that defines the nuclearity of the DUs (mono-or multi-nuclear relation), and the number of DUs linked. Among the six schemes, two correspond to a link between more than two DUs, either a nucleus shared between two mono-nuclear relations (e.g. motivation and enablement) or a relation linking several nuclei (e.g. list). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Marcu (1997)</ref> proposed to simplify the representation to </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data</head><p>We test our discourse parser on six languages, using available RST corpora harmonized as described in Section 4.2. Information about the datasets are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">RST corpora</head><p>English The RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Marcu, 2001)</ref>, from now on En-DT, is the most widely used corpus to build discourse parsers. It contains 385 documents in English from the Wall Street Journal. The relation set contains 56 relations (ignoring nuclearity and embedding information 2 ). The inter-annotator agreement scores are 88.70 for the unlabeled structure (score "Span"), 77.72 for the structure with nuclearity ("Nuclearity") and 65.75 with relations ("Relation"). 3</p><p>Brazilian Portuguese We merged all the corpora annotated for Brazilian Portuguese, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maziero et al., 2015)</ref>, to form the Pt-DT. The largest corpus is CST-News 4 <ref type="figure">(</ref> Spanish The Spanish RST DT 7 , from now on Es-DT, contains 267 texts written by specialists on different topics (e.g. astrophysics, economy, law, linguistics) The relation set contains 29 relations. The authors report interannotator agreement of 86% in precision for the unlabeled structure, 82.46% for the structure with nuclearity and 76.81% with relations.</p><p>German The Postdam Commentary Corpus 2.0 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Stede, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stede and Neumann, 2014)</ref>, from now on De-DT, contains newspaper commentaries annotated at several levels. A part of this corpus (MAZ) contains 175 documents annotated within the RST framework using 30 relations. 9</p><p>Dutch The corpus for Dutch <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vliet et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Redeker et al., 2012)</ref>, from now on Nl-DT, contains 80 documents from expository (encyclopedias and science news website) and persuasive (fund-raising letters and commercial advertisements) genres, annotated with 31 relations. The authors report an agreement of 0.83 for discourse spans, 0.77 for nuclearity and 0.70 for relations.</p><p>Basque The Basque <ref type="bibr">RST DT 10 (Iruskieta et al., 2013)</ref>, from now on Eu-DT, contains 88 abstracts from three specialized domains -medicine, terminology and science -, annotated with 31 relations. The inter-annotator agreement is 81.67% for the identification of the CDU <ref type="bibr">(Iruskieta et al., 2015)</ref>, and 61.47% for the identification of the relations.</p><p>Other corpora To the best of our knowledge, the only two non English corpora not included are the one annotated for Tamil <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Subalalitha and Parthasarathi, 2012</ref>) that we were unable to find, and the (intra-sentential) one developed for Chinese <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wu et al., 2016)</ref>, for which we were unable to produce RST trees since annotation does not contain nuclearity indications.</p><p>For English, there are corpora annotated for other domains than the one covered by the En-DT. We however leave out-of-domain evaluation for future work: it requires to decide how to use a corpus annotated only at the sentence level (SFU review corpus) 11 , or a corpus annotated with genre specific relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Harmonization of the datasets</head><p>Recent discourse parsers built on the En-DT are based on pre-processed data: the corpus contains only binary trees, with the large label set mapped to 18 coarse-grained classes. In this section, we describe this pre-processing step for all corpora used. Discourse corpora have been released under three different file formats: dis (En-DT), lisp (Rhetalho and CorpusTCC) and rs3 (all remaining corpora). The first two ones are bracketed format, the third one is an XML encoding. In all cases, the trees encoded do not look like the one in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: the relations are annotated on the daughter nodes, on the satellite for mono-nuclear relations, or on all the nuclei for multi-nuclear relations. Moreover, in the rs3 format, the nuclearity of the segments is not directly annotated, it has to be retrieved using the type of the relation (indicated at the beginning of each file) and the previous principle. Our pre-processing step leads to corpora with bracketed files representing directly the RST trees (as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) with stand-off annotation of the text of the EDUs.</p><p>Note that, even if harmonized, the corpora are not parallel, making it hard to use them to study language variations for the discourse level. Some preliminary work exists on this question <ref type="bibr">(Iruskieta et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Pre-processing Some documents (format rs3) contain several roots or empty segments. We were generally able to remove useless units, that is units that are not linked to other ones within the tree, except for one document in the CST corpus (two roots, both linked to other units).</p><p>Another issue concerns unordered EDUs: the structure annotated contains nodes spanning non adjacent EDUs. In general, we were able to correct these cases, but we failed to automatically produce trees spanning only adjacent EDUs for three documents in the Eu-DT, and one document in the De-DT.</p><p>Binarization All the corpora contain non-binary trees that we map to binary ones. In the En-DT, common cases of non-binarity are nodes whose daughters all hold the same multi-nuclear relation -indicating that this relation spans multiple DUs, e.g. list. 12 In rare cases, the children are two satellites and a nucleus -indicating that the nucleus is shared by the satellites. These configurations are the ones described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Marcu, 1997</ref>) (see Section 3), and choosing right or left-branching leads to a similar interpretation. For the En-DT, rightbranching is the chosen strategy since <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Soricut and Marcu, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>We found more diverse cases in the other corpora, and, for some of them, right-branching is impossible. It is the case when the daughters are one nucleus (annotated with "Span", only indicating that this node spans several EDUs) and more than two satellites holding different relations -i.e. the nucleus is shared by all the relations. More precisely, the issue arises when the last two children are satellites. Using right-branching, we end with a node with two satellites as daughters, and thus a ill-formed tree. In order to keep as often as possible the "right-branching by default" strategy, we first do a right-branching and then a leftbranching: beginning with four children -S 1 -R i , N 2 -Span, S 3 -R j and S 4 -R k , indicating the relations R i (S 1 , N 2 ), R j (N 2 , S 3 ) and R k (N 2 , S 4 ) 13 -, we end up with the tree in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Finally, we used a right-branching in all cases, except when the two last children are satellites. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Binary tree for a node X with 4 children:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S 1 N 2 S 3 S 4 SN-R i NS-R j NS-R k</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">S 1 -R i , N 2 -Span, S 3 -R j and S 4 -R k .</formula><p>Label set harmonization We map all the relations used in the corpora to the 18 coarse grained classes  used to build the most recent discourse parsers on the En-DT. 14 The mapping for the En-DT is given in . For all the other corpora, we first map all the relations that exist in this mapping (i.e. used in the En-DT annotation scheme) to their corresponding classes. We end with 18 problematic relations, that is relations that were not used when annotating the En-DT.</p><p>Among them, 10 can be mapped easily, because they directly correspond to a class -explanation is mapped to the class EXPLANATION, elaboration to ELABORATION, joint to JOINT -, because they were just renamed -reformulation is mapped to the class RESTATEMENT and solutionhood (same as problem-solution) to TOPIC-COMMENT -, or because they correspond to a more-fine grained formulation of existing relations entity-elaboration is mapped to ELABORATION and the 4 volitional/non-volitional cause and result are mapped to the class CAUSE, corresponding to the relations cause and result in the En-DT.</p><p>For the remaining relations, we looked at the definition of the relations 15 to decide on a mapping. Note that this label mapping is made quite easy by the fact that all the corpora were annotated following the same underlying theory -they thus use relations defined using similar criteria -, and that we are using a coarse-grained classificationwe thus do not need to decide whether a relation is equivalent to another one, but rather whether it fits the properties of the other relations within a specific class. Label mappings for corpora annotated following different frameworks are still discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Roze, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Benamara and Taboada, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>We decided on the following mapping, considering the properties of the relations and the classes: parenthetical -used to give "additional details" -is mapped to ELABORATION, conjunction -similar to a list with only two elements -to JOINT, justify -similar to Explanationargumentative -and motivation -quite similar to reason and grouped with evidence in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Benamara and Taboada, 2015)</ref> -to EXPLANATION, preparation -presenting preliminary information, increasing the readiness to read the nucleus -to BACK-GROUND, and unconditional and unless -linked to condition -to CONDITION.</p><p>Finally, note that this mapping does not lead to having the same relation set for all the corpora, and that the relation distribution could vary among the datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discourse Parser</head><p>Our discourse parser builds discourse structures from segmented texts, we did not implement discourse segmenters for each language. Discourse segmenters only exist for English <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hernault et al., 2010)</ref> (95, 0% in F 1 ), Brazilian Portuguese (Pardo and Nunes, 2008) (56.8%) and Spanish (da Cunha et al., 2010; da Cunha et al., 2012) (80%). Discourse segmenters can be built quite easily relying only on manual rules as it is the case for the Spanish and Portuguese ones, especially considering that segmentation has generally been made coarser in the corpora built after the En-DT <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vliet et al., 2011)</ref>. While improving this first step is crucial, we focus on the harder step of tree building.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Description of the Parser</head><p>We used the syntactic parser described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coavoux and Crabbé (2016)</ref>, in the static oracle setting. We chose this parser because it can take pre-trained embeddings as input and, more importantly, because it was designed for morphologically rich languages and thus takes as input not only tokens and POS tags, but any token attribute that is then mapped to a real-valued vector, which allows the use of complex features.</p><p>The parser is a transition-based constituent parser that uses a lexicalized shift-reduce transition system <ref type="bibr">(Sagae and Lavie, 2005)</ref>. The transition system is based on two data structures -a stack (S) stores partial trees and a queue (B) con-tains the unparsed DUs. A parsing configuration is a couple S, B . In the initial configuration, S is empty and B contains the whole document. The parser iteratively applies actions to the current configuration, in order to derive new configurations until it reaches a final state, i.e. a parsing configuration where B is empty and S contains a single element (the root of the tree).</p><p>The actions are defined as follows:</p><p>• SHIFT pops an EDU from B and pushes it onto S.</p><p>• REDUCE-R-X and REDUCE-L-X pop two DUs from S, push a new CDU with the label X on S and assign its nucleus (Left or Right).</p><p>Scoring System As in Chen and Manning (2014), at each parsing step, the parser scores actions with a feed-forward neural network. The input of the network is a sequence of typed symbols extracted from the top elements of S and B. The symbols are typically discourse relations or attributes of their nucleus EDU (e.g. first word of EDU, see Section 5.3).</p><p>The first layer of the network projects these symbols onto an embedding space (each type of symbol has its own embedding matrix). The following two layers are non-linear layers with a ReLU activation. The output of the network is a probability distribution over possible actions computed by a softmax layer.</p><p>To generate a set of training examples {a (i) , c (i) } N i=1 , we used the static oracle to extract the gold sequence of actions and configurations for each tree in the corpus. The objective function of the parser is the negative log-likelihood of gold actions given corresponding configurations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L(θ) = − N i=1 log P (a (i) |c (i) ; θ)</formula><p>where θ is the set of all parameters, including embedding matrices.</p><p>We optimized this objective with the averaged stochastic gradient descent algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Polyak and Juditsky, 1992)</ref>. At inference time, we used beamsearch to find the best-scoring tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Cross-lingual Discourse Parsing</head><p>Our first experiments are strictly monolingual, and they are intended to give state-of-the-art performance in a fully supervised setting. We consider that we need at least 100 documents to build a monolingual model, since we already keep around 65 documents for test and development.</p><p>We then evaluate multi-source transfer methods, considering one language as the target and the others as sources. More precisely, we will evaluate two settings: (1) training and optimizing only on the available source data; (2) training on all available data, including target ones if any, and optimizing on the development set of the target language. Setting (1) provides performance when no data are available at all in the target language, while (2) aims at evaluating if one can expect improvements by simply combining all the available data.</p><p>When combining the corpora, we cannot ignore lexical information as it has been done for syntactic parsing with delexicalized models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(McDonald et al., 2011)</ref>. Discourse parsing is a semantic task, at least when it comes to predict a rhetorical relation between two spans of text, and information from words have proven to be crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rutherford and Xue, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Braud and Denis, 2015)</ref>. We thus include word features using bilingual dictionaries -i.e. translating the words used as features into a single language (English) -, or through crosslingual word embeddings as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guo et al., 2015)</ref> for dependency parsing. More precisely, we used the cross-lingual word representations presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Levy et al., 2017</ref>) that allow multi-source learning and have proven useful for POS tagging but also more semantic-oriented tasks, such as dependency parsing and document classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Features</head><p>As in previous studies, we used features representing the two EDUs on the top of the stack and the EDU on the queue. If the stack contains CDUs, we use the nuclearity principle to choose the head EDU, converting multi-nuclear relations into nucleus-satellite ones as done since <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sagae, 2009</ref>). However, we found that using these information also for the left and right children of the two CDUs on the top of the stack, and adding as a feature the representation built for these two CDUs lead to important improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexical features</head><p>We use the first three words and the last word along with their POS, features that have proven useful for discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pitler et al., 2009)</ref>, and the words in the head set <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sagae, 2009)</ref> -i.e. words whose head in the dependency graph is not in the EDU -, here limited to the first three. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> This head set contains the head of the sentence (in general, the main event), or words linked to the main clause when the segment does not contain the head (especially, discourse connectives that are subordinating or coordinating conjunctions could be found there). The words are the boundaries could also contain discourse connectives, adverbs or temporal expressions that could be relevant for discourse structure. Note however that these feature have been built for English, and they could be less useful for other languages. We leave the question of investigating their utility linked to word order differences for future work.</p><p>Note that we do not use all the words in the EDUs as features, contrary to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>. Our only word features are the words in the head set and at the boundaries, thus 7 words per EDU. When using word embeddings, we concatenate the vectors for each word, each of d dimensions, keeping the same order to build a vector of 7d dimensions (e.g., the first word of the EDU corresponds to the first d dimensions, the second has values between d and 2d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Position and length</head><p>Other features are used to represent the position of the EDU in the document and its length in tokens. We use thresholds to distinguish between very long (length l &gt; 25 tokens), long (l &gt; 15), short (l &gt; 5) and very short (l ≤ 5) EDUs. We also distinguish between the "first" and the "last" EDU in the document, and use also a threshold on the ratio s =(position of the EDU divided by the total number of EDUs) to separate EDUs at the beginning (s &lt; 0.25), in the first middle (0.25 ≤ s &lt; 0.5), in the second middle (0.5 ≤ s &lt; 0.75) or in the end (s &gt;= 0.75).</p><p>Position of the head We add a boolean feature indicating if the head of the sentence is in the current EDU or outside.</p><p>Number/date/percent/money We also use 4 indicators of the presence of a date, a number, an amount of money and a percentage, features that have proven to be useful for discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pitler et al., 2009</ref>).

We keep only the 50 first dimensions of the vectors representing the words, our preliminary experiments suggesting no significant differences against keeping the whole 200 dimensions. Unknown words are represented by the average vector of all word vectors. For Basque, we had no access to these embeddings, we thus only report results using bilingual Wiktionaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter tuning</head><p>In our experiments we optimized on the development set the following parameters: the learning rate ∈ {0.01, 0.02, 0.03}, the learning rate decay constant ∈ {10 −5 , 10 −6 , 10 −7 , 0}, the number of iterations ∈ [1 − 20], and the size of the beam ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}. We fixed the number N of hidden layers to 2 and the size of the hidden layers H to 128 after experimenting on the En-DT (with N ∈ {1, 2, 3} and H ∈ {64, 128}).</p><p>We fixed the size of the vectors for each feature to 50 for word features, 21 16 for POS, 6 for position, 4 for length, and 2 for other features.</p><p>Metrics Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Marcu, 2000b)</ref> and most subsequent work, output trees are evaluated against gold trees in terms of how similar they bracket the EDUs (Span), how often they agree about nuclei when predicting a true bracket (Nuclearity), and in terms of the relation label, i.e., the overlap between the shared brackets between predicted and gold trees (Relation). <ref type="bibr">22</ref> These scores are analogous to labeled and unlabeled syntactic parser evaluation metrics.</p><p>Baseline Since we do not have state-of-the-art results for most of the languages, we provide results for a simple most frequent baseline (System MFS) that labels all nodes with the most frequent relation in the training or development set -that is NN-JOINT for De-DT and Es-DT, and NS-ELABORATION for the others -, and build the structure by right-branching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>Monolingual experiments Monolingual experiments are aimed at evaluating performance for languages having a large annotated corpus (at least 100 documents). Our results are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Our parser is competitive with state-ofthe-art systems for English (first line in <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>, with even better performance for unlabeled structure (85.04%) and structure labeled with nuclearity (72.29%). These results show that using all the words in the units <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ji and Eisenstein, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2014)</ref>, is not as useful as using more contextual information, that is taking more DUs into account (left and right children of the CDUs in the stack). However, the slight drop for Relation shows that we probably miss some lexical information, or that we need to choose a more effective combination scheme than concatenation. We plan to use bi-LSTM encoders <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> to construct fixed-length representations of EDUs.</p><p>For the other languages, performance are still high for unlabeled structure, but far lower for labeled structure except for Spanish. For this language, the quite high performance obtained were unexpected, since the corpus is far much smaller than the Portuguese one. One possible explanation is that the Portuguese corpus is in fact a mix of different corpora, with varied domains, and possibly changes in annotation choices. On the other hand, the low results for German show the sparsity issue since it is the language for which we have the fewest annotations ("#CDU", see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-lingual experiments</head><p>When only relying on data from different languages ("Cross" in Table 3), we observe a large drop in performance compared to monolingual systems. The sourceonly discourse parsers still have fairly high performance for unlabeled structure (around 70% or higher), the scores being especially low for relation identification. This could indicate that our representation does not generalize well. But it also comes from differences among the corpora. For example, only the En-DT and the Pt-DT use the relation ATTRIBUTION. This leads to a large drop in performance associated with this relation, when one of these corpora is not in the training data, especially for the source-only system for the En-DT (from 93% in F 1 to 30%). On the other hand, on the En-DT, we observe improvement for other relations either largely represented in all the corpora (e.g. JOINT +3%), or under-represented in the En-DT (e.g. CONDITION +3%).</p><p>When combining corpora for source and target languages ("+ dev." in <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>, we obtain our best performing system for English, with all scores improved compared to our best monolingual system (+0.8 for Nuclearity and +1.3 for Relation). Otherwise scores are similar to the monolingual case.</p><p>Finally, for languages without training set (Nl-DT and Eu-DT), this strategy allows us to build parsers outperforming our simple baseline (MFS) by around 11−13% for Span, 8−15% for Nuclearity and 6−11% for Relation. Having at least some annotated data to make a development set allows improvements against only using corpora in other  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Performance of our monolingual and cross-lingual systems for Span (Sp), Nuclearity (Nuc) and Relation (Rel). "MFS" corresponds to the baseline system described in Section 6; "+ emb." is the monolingual system using word embeddings; "+dev." means that the system is optimized on the development set of the target language (vs the union of the source development sets). For cross-lingual systems, we only report our best results using either word embeddings or bilingual dictionaries.</p><p>a Scores reported from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>, and DPLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ji and Eisenstein, 2014)</ref>. b For Brazilian Portuguese, inter-annotator agreement scores are only available for the CST-news corpus ; For Spanish, only precision scores are reported ; For Basque, the scores reported are different <ref type="bibr">(Iruskieta et al., 2015)</ref>. languages (around +3% for the Nl-DT and the Eu-DT for Relation). On the other hand, we probably overfit our development data for the Eu-DT, since better results were obtained for unlabeled structure (+2%) and structure with nuclearity (+2.5%) using only data in other languages.</p><p>Word embeddings Using word embeddings ("+emb" in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) for monolingual systems often leads to an important drop in performance, especially for Relation (from −1.1 to −4.2%). This demonstrates that these embeddings do not provide the large range of information needed for relation identification, a task inherently semantic. We believe however that the results are not too low to prevent for interesting applications. It is noteworthy that the English parser with embeddings is still better than the systems proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hernault et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Joty et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For cross-lingual experiments, the bilingual dictionaries perform generally better than embeddings (except for Pt-DT and De-DT for sourceonly systems), demonstrating again that we need representations more tailored to the task to leverage all relevant lexical information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced a new discourse parser that obtains state-of-the-art performance for English.
