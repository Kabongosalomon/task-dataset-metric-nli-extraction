<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Deep residual networks (ResNets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> consist of many stacked "Residual Units". Each unit ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 (a)</ref>) can be expressed in a general form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y l = h(x l ) + F(x l , W l ),</formula><p>x l+1 = f (y l ), where x l and x l+1 are input and output of the l-th unit, and F is a residual function. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, h(x l ) = x l is an identity mapping and f is a ReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> function.</p><p>ResNets that are over 100-layer deep have shown state-of-the-art accuracy for several challenging recognition tasks on ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> and MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> competitions. The central idea of ResNets is to learn the additive residual function F with respect to h(x l ), with a key choice of using an identity mapping h(x l ) = x l . This is realized by attaching an identity skip connection ("shortcut").</p><p>In this paper, we analyze deep residual networks by focusing on creating a "direct" path for propagating information -not only within a residual unit, but through the entire network. Our derivations reveal that if both h(x l ) and f (y l ) are identity mappings, the signal could be directly propagated from one unit to any other units, in both forward and backward passes. Our experiments empirically show that training in general becomes easier when the architecture is closer to the above two conditions.</p><p>To understand the role of skip connections, we analyze and compare various types of h(x l ). We find that the identity mapping h(x l ) = x l chosen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> arXiv:1603.05027v3 [cs.CV] 25 Jul 2016  achieves the fastest error reduction and lowest training loss among all variants we investigated, whereas skip connections of scaling, gating <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, and 1×1 convolutions all lead to higher training loss and error. These experiments suggest that keeping a "clean" information path (indicated by the grey arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1, 2</ref>, and 4) is helpful for easing optimization.</p><p>To construct an identity mapping f (y l ) = y l , we view the activation functions (ReLU and BN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>) as "pre-activation" of the weight layers, in contrast to conventional wisdom of "post-activation". This point of view leads to a new residual unit design, shown in ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1(b)</ref>). Based on this unit, we present competitive results on CIFAR-10/100 with a 1001-layer ResNet, which is much easier to train and generalizes better than the original ResNet in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. We further report improved results on ImageNet using a 200-layer ResNet, for which the counterpart of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> starts to overfit. These results suggest that there is much room to exploit the dimension of network depth, a key to the success of modern deep learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Analysis of Deep Residual Networks</head><p>The ResNets developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> are modularized architectures that stack building blocks of the same connecting shape. In this paper we call these blocks "Residual Units". The original Residual Unit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> performs the following computation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y l = h(x l ) + F(x l , W l ), (1) x l+1 = f (y l ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here x l is the input feature to the l-th Residual Unit. W l = {W l,k | 1≤k≤K } is a set of weights (and biases) associated with the l-th Residual Unit, and K is the number of layers in a Residual Unit (K is 2 or 3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>). F denotes the residual function, e.g., a stack of two 3×3 convolutional layers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. The function f is the operation after element-wise addition, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> f is ReLU. The function h is set as an identity mapping: h(x l ) = x l . 1 If f is also an identity mapping: x l+1 ≡ y l , we can put Eqn.(2) into Eqn.(1) and obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x l+1 = x l + F(x l , W l ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Recursively</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(x l+2 = x l+1 + F (x l+1 , W l+1 ) = x l + F (x l , W l ) + F (x l+1 , W l+1 )</formula><p>, etc.) we will have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x L = x l + L−1 i=l F(x i , W i ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>for any deeper unit L and any shallower unit l. Eqn.(4) exhibits some nice properties. (i) The feature x L of any deeper unit L can be represented as the feature x l of any shallower unit l plus a residual function in a form of L−1 i=l F, indicating that the model is in a residual fashion between any units L and l. (ii)</p><p>The feature x L = x 0 + L−1 i=0 F(x i , W i ), of any deep unit L, is the summation of the outputs of all preceding residual functions (plus x 0 ). This is in contrast to a "plain network" where a feature x L is a series of matrix-vector products, say, L−1 i=0 W i x 0 (ignoring BN and ReLU).</p><p>Eqn.(4) also leads to nice backward propagation properties. Denoting the loss function as E, from the chain rule of backpropagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∂E ∂x l = ∂E ∂x L ∂x L ∂x l = ∂E ∂x L 1 + ∂ ∂x l L−1 i=l F(x i , W i ) .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> indicates that the gradient ∂E ∂x l can be decomposed into two additive terms: a term of ∂E ∂x L that propagates information directly without concerning any weight layers, and another term of ∂E ∂x L ∂ ∂x l L−1 i=l F that propagates through the weight layers. The additive term of ∂E ∂x L ensures that information is directly propagated back to any shallower unit l. Eqn.(5) also suggests that it <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> It is noteworthy that there are Residual Units for increasing dimensions and reducing feature map sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> in which h is not identity. In this case the following derivations do not hold strictly. But as there are only a very few such units (two on CIFAR and three on ImageNet, depending on image sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>), we expect that they do not have the exponential impact as we present in Sec. 3. One may also think of our derivations as applied to all Residual Units within the same feature map size.</p><p>is unlikely for the gradient ∂E ∂x l to be canceled out for a mini-batch, because in general the term ∂ ∂x l L−1 i=l F cannot be always -1 for all samples in a mini-batch. This implies that the gradient of a layer does not vanish even when the weights are arbitrarily small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions</head><p>Eqn.(4) and Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> suggest that the signal can be directly propagated from any unit to another, both forward and backward. The foundation of Eqn.(4) is two identity mappings: (i) the identity skip connection h(x l ) = x l , and (ii) the condition that f is an identity mapping.</p><p>These directly propagated information flows are represented by the grey arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1, 2</ref>, and 4. And the above two conditions are true when these grey arrows cover no operations (expect addition) and thus are "clean". In the following two sections we separately investigate the impacts of the two conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">On the Importance of Identity Skip Connections</head><p>Let's consider a simple modification, h(x l ) = λ l x l , to break the identity shortcut:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x l+1 = λ l x l + F(x l , W l ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where λ l is a modulating scalar (for simplicity we still assume f is identity).</p><p>Recursively applying this formulation we obtain an equation similar to Eqn. (4):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x L = ( L−1 i=l λ i )x l + L−1 i=l ( L−1 j=i+1 λ j )F(x i , W i )</formula><p>, or simply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x L = ( L−1 i=l λ i )x l + L−1 i=lF (x i , W i ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the notationF absorbs the scalars into the residual functions. Similar to Eqn.(5), we have backpropagation of the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∂E ∂x l = ∂E ∂x L ( L−1 i=l λ i ) + ∂ ∂x l L−1 i=lF (x i , W i ) .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Unlike Eqn.(5), in Eqn.(8) the first additive term is modulated by a factor L−1 i=l λ i . For an extremely deep network (L is large), if λ i &gt; 1 for all i, this factor can be exponentially large; if λ i &lt; 1 for all i, this factor can be exponentially small and vanish, which blocks the backpropagated signal from the shortcut and forces it to flow through the weight layers. This results in optimization difficulties as we show by experiments.</p><p>In the above analysis, the original identity skip connection in Eqn.(3) is replaced with a simple scaling h(x l ) = λ l x l . If the skip connection h(x l ) represents more complicated transforms (such as gating and 1×1 convolutions), in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref> the first term becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L−1 i=l h i where h is the derivative of h.</formula><p>This product may also impede information propagation and hamper the training procedure as witnessed in the following experiments.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The grey arrows indicate the easiest paths for the information to propagate. The shortcut connections in (b-f) are impeded by different components. For simplifying illustrations we do not display the BN layers, which are adopted right after the weight layers for all units here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experiments on Skip Connections</head><p>We experiment with the 110-layer ResNet as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> on CIFAR-10 [10]. This extremely deep ResNet-110 has 54 two-layer Residual Units (consisting of 3×3 convolutional layers) and is challenging for optimization. Our implementation details (see appendix) are the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Throughout this paper we report the median accuracy of 5 runs for each architecture on CIFAR, reducing the impacts of random variations. Though our above analysis is driven by identity f , the experiments in this section are all based on f = ReLU as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>; we address identity f in the next section. Our baseline ResNet-110 has 6.61% error on the test set. The comparisons of other variants ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) are summarized as follows:</p><p>Constant scaling. We set λ = 0.5 for all shortcuts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2(b)</ref>). We further study two cases of scaling F: (i) F is not scaled; or (ii) F is scaled by a constant scalar of 1 − λ = 0.5, which is similar to the highway gating <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> but with frozen gates. The former case does not converge well; the latter is able to converge, but the test error (Table 1, 12.35%) is substantially higher than the original ResNet-110. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3(a)</ref> shows that the training error is higher than that of the original ResNet-110, suggesting that the optimization has difficulties when the shortcut signal is scaled down. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Classification error on the CIFAR-10 test set using ResNet-110 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, with different types of shortcut connections applied to all Residual Units. We report "fail" when the test error is higher than 20%. </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">1 − g(x) g(x) fail init bg =0 to −5 1 − g(x) g(x) 8.70 init bg =-6 1 − g(x) g(x) 9.81 init bg =-7</formula><p>shortcut-only gating <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(d) 1 − g(x) 1 12.86 init bg =0 1 − g(x) 1 6.91 init bg =-6</formula><p>1×1 conv shortcut <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref> Exclusive gating. Following the Highway Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> that adopt a gating mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, we consider a gating function g(x) = σ(W g x + b g ) where a transform is represented by weights W g and biases b g followed by the sigmoid function σ(x) = 1 1+e −x . In a convolutional network g(x) is realized by a 1×1 convolutional layer. The gating function modulates the signal by element-wise multiplication.</p><p>We investigate the "exclusive" gates as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref> -the F path is scaled by g(x) and the shortcut path is scaled by 1−g(x). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 2(c)</ref>. We find that the initialization of the biases b g is critical for training gated models, and following the guidelines 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, we conduct hyper-parameter search on the initial value of b g in the range of 0 to -10 with a decrement step of -1 on the training set by crossvalidation. The best value (−6 here) is then used for training on the training set, leading to a test result of 8.70% <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, which still lags far behind the ResNet-110 baseline. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 3(b)</ref> shows the training curves. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> also reports the results of using other initialized values, noting that the exclusive gating network does not converge to a good solution when b g is not appropriately initialized.</p><p>The impact of the exclusive gating mechanism is two-fold. When 1 − g(x) approaches 1, the gated shortcut connections are closer to identity which helps information propagation; but in this case g(x) approaches 0 and suppresses the function F. To isolate the effects of the gating functions on the shortcut path alone, we investigate a non-exclusive gating mechanism in the next.</p><p>Shortcut-only gating. In this case the function F is not scaled; only the shortcut path is gated by 1 − g(x). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 2(d)</ref>. The initialized value of b g is still essential in this case. When the initialized b g is 0 (so initially the expectation of 1 − g(x) is 0.5), the network converges to a poor result of 12.86% <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. This is also caused by higher training error <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig 3(c)</ref>).  When the initialized b g is very negatively biased (e.g., −6), the value of 1 − g(x) is closer to 1 and the shortcut connection is nearly an identity mapping. Therefore, the result (6.91%, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) is much closer to the ResNet-110 baseline.</p><p>1×1 convolutional shortcut. Next we experiment with 1×1 convolutional shortcut connections that replace the identity. This option has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> (known as option C) on a 34-layer ResNet (16 Residual Units) and shows good results, suggesting that 1×1 shortcut connections could be useful. But we find that this is not the case when there are many Residual Units. The 110-layer ResNet has a poorer result (12.22%, <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) when using 1×1 convolutional shortcuts. Again, the training error becomes higher <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig 3(d)</ref>). When stacking so many Residual Units (54 for ResNet-110), even the shortest path may still impede signal propagation. We witnessed similar phenomena on ImageNet with ResNet-101 when using 1×1 convolutional shortcuts.</p><p>Dropout shortcut. Last we experiment with dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> (at a ratio of 0.5) which we adopt on the output of the identity shortcut ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2(f)</ref>). The network fails to converge to a good solution. Dropout statistically imposes a scale of λ with an expectation of 0.5 on the shortcut, and similar to constant scaling by 0.5, it impedes signal propagation. ReLU before addition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref>(c) 7.84 6.14 ReLU-only pre-activation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(d</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. All these units consist of the same components -only the orders are different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Discussions</head><p>As indicated by the grey arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, the shortcut connections are the most direct paths for the information to propagate. Multiplicative manipulations (scaling, gating, 1×1 convolutions, and dropout) on the shortcuts can hamper information propagation and lead to optimization problems. It is noteworthy that the gating and 1×1 convolutional shortcuts introduce more parameters, and should have stronger representational abilities than identity shortcuts. In fact, the shortcut-only gating and 1×1 convolution cover the solution space of identity shortcuts (i.e., they could be optimized as identity shortcuts). However, their training error is higher than that of identity shortcuts, indicating that the degradation of these models is caused by optimization issues, instead of representational abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">On the Usage of Activation Functions</head><p>Experiments in the above section support the analysis in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> and Eqn.(8), both being derived under the assumption that the after-addition activation f is the identity mapping. But in the above experiments f is ReLU as designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, so Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref> are approximate in the above experiments. Next we investigate the impact of f .</p><p>We want to make f an identity mapping, which is done by re-arranging the activation functions (ReLU and/or BN). The original Residual Unit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> has a shape in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(a)</ref> -BN is used after each weight layer, and ReLU is adopted after BN except that the last ReLU in a Residual Unit is after elementwise addition (f = ReLU). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(b-e)</ref> show the alternatives we investigated, explained as following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiments on Activation</head><p>In this section we experiment with ResNet-110 and a 164-layer Bottleneck <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> architecture (denoted as ResNet-164). A bottleneck Residual Unit consist of a 1×1 layer for reducing dimension, a 3×3 layer, and a 1×1 layer for restoring dimension. As designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, its computational complexity is similar to the two-3×3 Residual Unit. More details are in the appendix. The baseline ResNet-164 has a competitive result of 5.93% on CIFAR-10 ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>BN after addition. Before turning f into an identity mapping, we go the opposite way by adopting BN after addition ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(b)</ref>). In this case f involves BN and ReLU. The results become considerably worse than the baseline (Table 2). Unlike the original design, now the BN layer alters the signal that passes through the shortcut and impedes information propagation, as reflected by the difficulties on reducing training loss at the beginning of training (Fib. 6 left).</p><p>ReLU before addition. A naïve choice of making f into an identity mapping is to move the ReLU before addition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 4(c)</ref>). However, this leads to a non-negative output from the transform F, while intuitively a "residual" function should take values in (−∞, +∞). As a result, the forward propagated signal is monotonically increasing. This may impact the representational ability, and the result is worse (7.84%, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>) than the baseline. We expect to have a residual function taking values in (−∞, +∞). This condition is satisfied by other Residual Units including the following ones.</p><p>Post-activation or pre-activation? In the original design (Eqn.(1) and Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>), the activation x l+1 = f (y l ) affects both paths in the next Residual Unit: y l+1 = f (y l ) + F(f (y l ), W l+1 ). Next we develop an asymmetric form where an activationf only affects the F path: y l+1 = y l + F(f (y l ), W l+1 ), for any l <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5 (a) to (b)</ref>). By renaming the notations, we have the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">x l+1 = x l + F(f (x l ), W l ), .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that Eqn.(9) is similar to Eqn.(4), and can enable a backward formulation similar to Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. For this new Residual Unit as in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>, the new after-addition activation becomes an identity mapping. This design means that if a new after-addition activationf is asymmetrically adopted, it is equivalent to recastingf as the pre-activation of the next Residual Unit. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. ... <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Using asymmetric after-addition activation is equivalent to constructing a pre-activation Residual Unit. The distinction between post-activation/pre-activation is caused by the presence of the element-wise addition. For a plain network that has N layers, there are N − 1 activations (BN/ReLU), and it does not matter whether we think of them as post-or pre-activations. But for branched layers merged by addition, the position of activation matters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c)</head><p>We experiment with two such designs: (i) ReLU-only pre-activation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(d)</ref>), and (ii) full pre-activation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(e)</ref>) where BN and ReLU are both adopted before weight layers. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows that the ReLU-only pre-activation performs very similar to the baseline on ResNet-110/164.

We also experiment on CIFAR-100. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows that our "pre-activation" models are consistently better than the baseline counterparts. We analyze these results in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis</head><p>We find the impact of pre-activation is twofold. First, the optimization is further eased (comparing with the baseline ResNet) because f is an identity mapping. Second, using BN as pre-activation improves regularization of the models. Ease of optimization. This effect is particularly obvious when training the 1001-layer ResNet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> shows the curves. Using the original design in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, the training error is reduced very slowly at the beginning of training. For f = ReLU, the signal is impacted if it is negative, and when there are many Residual Units, this effect becomes prominent and Eqn.(3) (so Eqn.(5)) is not a good approximation. On the other hand, when f is an identity mapping, the signal can be propagated directly between any two units. Our 1001-layer network reduces the training loss very quickly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>. It also achieves the lowest loss among all models we investigated, suggesting the success of optimization.</p><p>We also find that the impact of f = ReLU is not severe when the ResNet has fewer layers (e.g., 164 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6(right)</ref>). The training curve seems to suffer a little bit at the beginning of training, but goes into a healthy status soon. By monitoring the responses we observe that this is because after some training, the weights are adjusted into a status such that y l in Eqn.(1) is more frequently above zero and f does not truncate it (x l is always non-negative due to the previous ReLU, so y l is below zero only when the magnitude of F is very negative). The truncation, however, is more frequent when there are 1000 layers. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using "moderate data augmentation" (flip/translation), except for ELU <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> with no augmentation. Better results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> have been reported using stronger data augmentation and ensembling. For the ResNets we also report the number of parameters. Our results are the median of 5 runs with mean±std in the brackets. All ResNets results are obtained with a mini-batch size of 128 except † with a mini-batch size of 64 (code available at https://github.com/KaimingHe/resnet-1k-layers). Reducing overfitting. Another impact of using the proposed pre-activation unit is on regularization, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (right)</ref>. The pre-activation version reaches slightly higher training loss at convergence, but produces lower test error. This phenomenon is observed on ResNet-110, ResNet-110(1-layer), and ResNet-164 on both CIFAR-10 and 100. This is presumably caused by BN's regularization effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. In the original Residual Unit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 4(a)</ref>), although the BN normalizes the signal, this is soon added to the shortcut and thus the merged signal is not normalized. This unnormalized signal is then used as the input of the next weight layer. On the contrary, in our pre-activation version, the inputs to all weight layers have been normalized.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Comparisons on CIFAR-10/100. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> compares the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10/100, where we achieve competitive results. We note that we do not specially tailor the network width or filter sizes, nor use regularization techniques (such as dropout) which are very effective for these small datasets. We obtain these results via a simple but essential concept -going deeper. These results demonstrate the potential of pushing the limits of depth.</p><p>Comparisons on ImageNet. Next we report experimental results on the 1000class ImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. We have done preliminary experiments using the skip connections studied in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2 &amp; 3</ref> on ImageNet with ResNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, and observed similar optimization difficulties. The training error of these non-identity shortcut networks is obviously higher than the original ResNet at the first learning rate <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Comparisons of single-crop error on the ILSVRC 2012 validation set. All ResNets are trained using the same hyper-parameters and implementations as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>). Our Residual Units are the full pre-activation version ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(e)</ref>). † : code/model available at https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch/tree/master/pretrained, using scale and aspect ratio augmentation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. (similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 3</ref>), and we decided to halt training due to limited resources. But we did finish a "BN after addition" version ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(b)</ref>) of ResNet-101 on ImageNet and observed higher training loss and validation error. This model's single-crop (224×224) validation error is 24.6%/7.5%, vs. the original ResNet-101's 23.6%/7.1%. This is in line with the results on CIFAR in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 (left)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the results of ResNet-152 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> and ResNet-200 3 , all trained from scratch. We notice that the original ResNet paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> trained the models using scale jittering with shorter side s ∈ [256, 480], and so the test of a 224×224 crop on s = 256 (as did in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>) is negatively biased. Instead, we test a single 320×320 crop from s = 320, for all original and our ResNets. Even though the ResNets are trained on smaller crops, they can be easily tested on larger crops because the ResNets are fully convolutional by design. This size is also close to 299×299 used by Inception v3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, allowing a fairer comparison.</p><p>The original ResNet-152 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> has top-1 error of 21.3% on a 320×320 crop, and our pre-activation counterpart has 21.1%. The gain is not big on ResNet-152 because this model has not shown severe generalization difficulties. However, the original ResNet-200 has an error rate of 21.8%, higher than the baseline ResNet-152. But we find that the original ResNet-200 has lower training error than ResNet-152, suggesting that it suffers from overfitting.</p><p>Our pre-activation ResNet-200 has an error rate of 20.7%, which is 1.1% lower than the baseline ResNet-200 and also lower than the two versions of ResNet-152. When using the scale and aspect ratio augmentation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>, our ResNet-200 has a result better than Inception v3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>  <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>). Concurrent with our work, an Inception-ResNet-v2 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> achieves a single-crop result of 19.9%/4.9%. We expect our observations and the proposed Residual Unit will help this type and generally other types of ResNets.</p><p>Computational Cost. Our models' computational complexity is linear on</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This paper investigates the propagation formulations behind the connection mechanisms of deep residual networks. Our derivations imply that identity shortcut connections and identity after-addition activation are essential for making information propagation smooth. Ablation experiments demonstrate phenomena that are consistent with our derivations. We also present 1000-layer deep networks that can be easily trained and achieve improved accuracy.</p><p>Appendix: Implementation Details The implementation details and hyperparameters are the same as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. On CIFAR we use only the translation and flipping augmentation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> for training. The learning rate starts from 0.1, and is divided by 10 at 32k and 48k iterations. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, for all CIFAR experiments we warm up the training by using a smaller learning rate of 0.01 at the beginning 400 iterations and go back to 0.1 after that, although we remark that this is not necessary for our proposed Residual Unit. The mini-batch size is 128 on 2 GPUs (64 each), the weight decay is 0.0001, the momentum is 0.9, and the weights are initialized as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>On ImageNet, we train the models using the same data augmentation as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. The learning rate starts from 0.1 (no warming up), and is divided by 10 at 30 and 60 epochs. The mini-batch size is 256 on 8 GPUs (32 each). The weight decay, momentum, and weight initialization are the same as above.</p><p>When using the pre-activation Residual Units ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4(d)</ref>(e) and <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), we pay special attention to the first and the last Residual Units of the entire network. For the first Residual Unit (that follows a stand-alone convolutional layer, conv 1 ), we adopt the first activation right after conv 1 and before splitting into two paths; for the last Residual Unit (followed by average pooling and a fullyconnected classifier), we adopt an extra activation right after its element-wise addition. These two special cases are the natural outcome when we obtain the pre-activation network via the modification procedure as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>The bottleneck Residual Units (for ResNet-164/1001 on CIFAR) are constructed following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. For example, a 3×3, 16 <ref type="bibr">3×3, 16</ref> unit in ResNet-110 is replaced with a    1×1, 16 3×3, 16 1×1, 64    unit in ResNet-164, both of which have roughly the same number of parameters. For the bottleneck ResNets, when reducing the feature map size we use projection shortcuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> for increasing dimensions, and when preactivation is used, these projection shortcuts are also with pre-activation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Left: (a) original Residual Unit in [1]; (b) proposed Residual Unit.
