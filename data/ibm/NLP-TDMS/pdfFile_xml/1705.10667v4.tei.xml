<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Deep networks have significantly improved the state-of-the-arts for diverse machine learning problems and applications. When trained on large-scale datasets, deep networks learn representations which are generically useful across a variety of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. However, deep networks can be weak at generalizing learned knowledge to new datasets or environments. Even a subtle change from the training domain can cause deep networks to make spurious predictions on the target domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. While in many real applications, there is the need to transfer a deep network from a source domain where sufficient training data is available to a target domain where only unlabeled data is available, such a transfer learning paradigm is hindered by the shift in data distributions across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Learning a model that reduces the dataset shift between training and testing distributions is known as domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Previous domain adaptation methods in the shallow regime either bridge the source and target by learning invariant feature representations or estimating instance importances using labeled source data and unlabeled target data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Recent advances of deep domain adaptation methods leverage deep networks to learn transferable representations by embedding adaptation modules in deep architectures, simultaneously disentangling the explanatory factors of variations behind data and matching feature distributions across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p><p>Adversarial domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> integrates adversarial learning and domain adaptation in a two-player game similarly to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A domain discriminator is learned by minimizing the classification error of distinguishing the source from the target domains, while a deep classification model learns transferable representations that are indistinguishable by the domain discriminator. On par with these feature-level approaches, generative pixel-level adaptation models perform distribution alignment in raw pixel space, by translating source data to the style of a target domain using Image to Image translation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Another line of works align distributions of features and classes separately using different domain discriminators <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">32nd</ref> Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montréal, Canada.</p><p>Despite their general efficacy for various tasks ranging from classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> to segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, these adversarial domain adaptation methods may still be constrained by two bottlenecks. First, when data distributions embody complex multimodal structures, adversarial adaptation methods may fail to capture such multimodal structures for a discriminative alignment of distributions without mode mismatch. Such a risk comes from the equilibrium challenge of adversarial learning in that even if the discriminator is fully confused, we have no guarantee that two distributions are sufficiently similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Note that this risk cannot be tackled by aligning distributions of features and classes via separate domain discriminators as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, since the multimodal structures can only be captured sufficiently by the cross-covariance dependency between the features and classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Second, it is risky to condition the domain discriminator on the discriminative information when it is uncertain.</p><p>In this paper, we tackle the two aforementioned challenges by formalizing a conditional adversarial domain adaptation framework. Recent advances in the Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> disclose that the distributions of real and generated images can be made similar by conditioning the generator and discriminator on discriminative information. Motivated by the conditioning insight, this paper presents Conditional Domain Adversarial Networks (CDANs) to exploit discriminative information conveyed in the classifier predictions to assist adversarial adaptation.</p><p>The key to the CDAN models is a novel conditional domain discriminator conditioned on the crosscovariance of domain-specific feature representations and classifier predictions. We further condition the domain discriminator on the uncertainty of classifier predictions, prioritizing the discriminator on easy-to-transfer examples. The overall system can be solved in linear-time through back-propagation. Based on the domain adaptation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we give a theoretical guarantee on the generalization error bound. Experiments show that our models exceed state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets.</p></div>

Besides the aforementioned shallow architectures, recent studies reveal that deep networks learn more transferable representations that disentangle the explanatory factors of variations behind data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and manifest invariant factors underlying different populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. As deep representations can only reduce, but not remove, the cross-domain distribution discrepancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, recent research on deep domain adaptation further embeds adaptation modules in deep networks using two main technologies for distribution matching: moment matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> and adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p><p>Pioneered by the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the adversarial learning has been successfully explored for generative modeling. GANs constitute two networks in a two-player game: a generator that captures data distribution and a discriminator that distinguishes between generated samples and real data. The networks are trained in a minimax paradigm such that the generator is learned to fool the discriminator while the discriminator struggles to be not fooled. Several difficulties of GANs have been addressed, e.g. improved training <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref> and mode collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, but others still remain, e.g. failure in matching two distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Towards adversarial learning for domain adaptation, unconditional ones have been leveraged while conditional ones remain under explored.</p><p>Sharing some spirit of the conditional GANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, another line of works match the features and classes using separate domain discriminators. Hoffman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> performs global domain alignment by learning features to deceive the domain discriminator, and category specific adaptation by minimizing a constrained multiple instance loss. In particular, the adversarial module for feature representation is not conditioned on the class-adaptation module with class information. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> performs classwise alignment over the classifier layer; i.e., multiple domain discriminators take as inputs only the softmax probabilities of source classifier, rather than conditioned on the class information. Tsai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> imposes two independent domain discriminators on the feature and class layers. These methods do not explore the dependency between the features and classes in a unified conditional domain discriminator, which is important to capture the multimodal structures underlying data distributions. This paper extends the conditional adversarial mechanism to enable discriminative and transferable domain adaptation, by defining the domain discriminator on the features while conditioning it on the class information. Two novel conditioning strategies are designed to capture the cross-covariance dependency between the feature representations and class predictions while controlling the uncertainty of classifier predictions. This is different from aligning the features and classes separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref>].</p></div>

The source domain and target domain are sampled from joint distributions P (x s , y s ) and Q(x t , y t ) respectively, and the i.i.d. assumption is violated as P = Q. The goal of this paper is to design a deep network G : x → y which formally reduces the shifts in the data distributions across domains, such that the target risk t (G) = E (x t ,y t )∼Q [G (x t ) = y t ] can be bounded by the source risk s (G) = E (x s ,y s )∼P [G (x s ) = y s ] plus the distribution discrepancy disc(P, Q) quantified by a novel conditional domain discriminator.</p><p>Adversarial learning, the key idea to enabling Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, has been successfully explored to minimize the cross-domain discrepancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Conditional Discriminator</head><p>We further improve existing adversarial domain adaptation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> in two directions. First, when the joint distributions of feature and class, i.e. P (x s , y s ) and Q(x t , y t ), are non-identical across domains, adapting only the feature representation f may be insufficient. Due to a quantitative study <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, deep representations eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks, with transferability decreased remarkably in the domain-specific feature layer f and classifier layer g. Second, when the feature distribution is multimodal, which is a real scenario due to the nature of multi-class classification, adapting only the feature representation may be challenging for adversarial networks. Recent work [17, 2, 7, 1] reveals the high risk of failure in matching only a fraction of components underlying different distributions with the adversarial networks. Even if the discriminator is fully confused, we have no theoretical guarantee that two different distributions are identical <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This paper tackles the two aforementioned challenges by formalizing a conditional adversarial domain adaptation framework. Recent advances in Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> discover that different distributions can be matched better by conditioning the generator and discriminator on relevant information, such as associated labels and affiliated modality. Conditional GANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> generate globally coherent images from datasets with high variability and multimodal distributions. Motivated by conditional GANs, we observe that in adversarial domain adaptation, the classifier prediction g conveys discriminative information potentially revealing the multimodal structures, which can be conditioned on when adapting feature representation f . By conditioning, domain variances in both feature representation f and classifier prediction g can be modeled simultaneously.</p><p>We formulate Conditional Domain Adversarial Network (CDAN) as a minimax optimization problem with two competitive error terms: (a) E(G) on the source classifier G, which is minimized to guarantee lower source risk; (b) E(D, G) on the source classifier G and the domain discriminator D across the source and target domains, which is minimized over D but maximized over f = F (x) and g = G(x):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(G) = E (x s i ,y s i )∼Ds L (G (x s i ) , y s i ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">E(D, G) = −E x s i ∼Ds log [D (f s i , g s i )] − E x t j ∼Dt log 1 − D f t j , g t j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L(·, ·) is the cross-entropy loss, and h = (f , g) is the joint variable of feature representation f and classifier prediction g. The minimax game of conditional domain adversarial network (CDAN) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min G E(G) − λE(D, G) min D E(D, G),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where λ is a hyper-parameter between the two objectives to tradeoff source risk and domain adversary.</p><p>We condition domain discriminator D on the classifier prediction g through joint variable h = (f , g). This conditional domain discriminator can potentially tackle the two aforementioned challenges of adversarial domain adaptation. A simple conditioning of D is D(f ⊕ g), where we concatenate the feature representation and classifier prediction in vector f ⊕ g and feed it to conditional domain discriminator D. This conditioning strategy is widely adopted by existing conditional GANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, with the concatenation strategy, f and g are independent on each other, thus failing to fully capture multiplicative interactions between feature representation and classifier prediction, which are crucial to domain adaptation. As a result, the multimodal information conveyed in classifier prediction cannot be fully exploited to match the multimodal distributions of complex domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multilinear Conditioning</head><p>The multilinear map is defined as the outer product of multiple random vectors. And the multilinear map of infinite-dimensional nonlinear feature maps has been successfully applied to embed joint distribution or conditional distribution into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.

Assume linear map φ(x) = x and one-hot label vector y in C classes. As can be verified,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">mean map E xy [x ⊕ y] = E x [x] ⊕ E y [y] computes the means of x and y independently.

Superior than concatenation, the multilinear map x ⊗ y can fully capture the multimodal structures behind complex data distributions.</p><p>Taking the advantage of multilinear map, in this paper, we condition D on g with the multilinear map</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T ⊗ (f , g) = f ⊗ g, (4) where T ⊗ is a multilinear map and D(f , g) = D(f ⊗ g).</formula><p>As such, the conditional domain discriminator successfully models the multimodal information and joint distributions of f and g. Also, the multi-linearity can accommodate random vectors f and g with different cardinalities and magnitudes.</p><p>A disadvantage of the multilinear map is dimension explosion. Denoting by d f and d g the dimensions of vectors f and g respectively, the dimension of multilinear map f ⊗ g is d f × d g , often too highdimensional to be embedded into deep networks without causing parameter explosion. This paper addresses the dimension explosion by randomized methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Note that multilinear map holds</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T ⊗ (f , g) , T ⊗ (f , g ) = f ⊗ g, f ⊗ g = f , f g, g ≈ T (f , g) , T (f , g ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where T (f , g) is the explicit randomized multilinear map of dimension d d f × d g . We define</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">T (f , g) = 1 √ d (R f f ) (R g g) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where is element-wise product, R f and R g are random matrices sampled only once and fixed in training, and each element R ij follows a symmetric distribution with univariance, i.e. E [R ij ] = 0, E[R 2 ij ] = 1. Applicable distributions include Gaussian distribution and Uniform distribution. As the inner-product on T ⊗ can be accurately approximated by the inner-product on T , we can directly adopt T (f , g) for computation efficiency. We guarantee such approximation quality by a theorem. Theorem 1. The expectation and variance of using</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">T (f , g) (6) to approximate T ⊗ (f , g) (4) satisfy E [ T (f , g) , T (f , g ) ] = f , f g, g , var [ T (f , g) , T (f , g ) ] = d i=1 β R f i , f β (R g i , g) + C,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">β R f i , f = 1 d d f j=1 [f 2 j f j 2 E[(R f ij ) 4 ] + C ]</formula><p>and similarly for β (R g i , g), C, C are constants.</p><p>Proof. The proof is given in the supplemental material.</p><p>This verifies that T is an unbiased estimate of T ⊗ in terms of inner product, with estimation variance depending only on the fourth-order moments E[(R f ij ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ] and E[(R g ij ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ], which are constants for many symmetric distributions with univariance, including Gaussian distribution and Uniform distribution. The bound reveals that wen can further minimize the approximation error by normalizing the features.</p><p>For simplicity we define the conditioning strategy used by the conditional domain discriminator D as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">T (h) = T ⊗ (f , g) if d f × d g 4096 T (f , g) otherwise,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where 4096 is the largest number of units in typical deep networks (e.g. AlexNet), and if dimension of the multilinear map T ⊗ is larger than 4096, then we will choose randomized multilinear map T .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>The results on Office-31 based on AlexNet and ResNet are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, with results of baselines directly reported from the original papers if protocol is the same. The CDAN models significantly outperform all comparison methods on most transfer tasks, where CDAN+E is a top-performing variant and CDAN performs slightly worse. It is desirable that CDAN promotes the classification accuracies substantially on hard transfer tasks, e.g. A → W and A → D, where the source and target domains are substantially different <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Note that, CDAN+E even outperforms generative pixel-level domain adaptation method GTA, which has a very complex design in both architecture and objectives.</p><p>The results on the ImageCLEF-DA dataset are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The CDAN models outperform the comparison methods on most transfer tasks, but with smaller rooms of improvement. This is reasonable since the three domains in ImageCLEF-DA are of equal size and balanced in each category, and are visually more similar than Office-31, making the former dataset easier for domain adaptation.   The results on Office-Home are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The CDAN models substantially outperform the comparison methods on most transfer tasks, and with larger rooms of improvement. An interpretation is that the four domains in Office-Home are with more categories, are visually more dissimilar with each other, and are difficult in each domain with much lower in-domain classification accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Since domain alignment is category agnostic in previous work, it is possible that the aligned domains are not classification friendly in the presence of large number of categories. It is desirable that CDAN models yield larger boosts on such difficult domain adaptation tasks, which highlights the power of adversarial domain adaptation by exploiting complex multimodal structures in classifier predictions.</p><p>Strong results are also achieved on the digits datasets and synthetic to real datasets as reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Note that the generative pixel-level adaptation methods UNIT, CyCADA, and GTA are specifically tailored to the digits and synthetic to real adaptation tasks. This explains why the previous feature-level adaptation method JAN performs fairly weakly. To our knowledge, CDAN+E is the only approach that works reasonably well on all five datasets, and remains a simple discriminative model.</p></div>

Distribution Discrepancy The A-distance is a measure for distribution discrepancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, defined as dist A = 2 (1 − 2 ), where is the test error of a classifier trained to discriminate the source from target. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(c) shows dist A on tasks A → W, W → D with features of ResNet, DANN, and CDAN. We observe that dist A on CDAN features is smaller than dist A on both ResNet and DANN features, implying that CDAN features can reduce the domain gap more effectively. As domains W and D are similar, dist A of task W → D is smaller than that of A → W, implying higher accuracies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A-&gt;W</head><p>Convergence We testify the convergence of ResNet, DANN, and CDANs, with the test errors on task A → W shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2(d)</ref>. CDAN enjoys faster convergence than DANN, while CDAN (M) converges faster than CDAN (RM). Note that CDAN (M) constitutes high-dimensional multilinear map, which is slightly more costly than CDAN (RM), while CDAN (RM) has similar cost as DANN. Visualization We visualize by t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in Figures 3(a)-3(d) the representations of task A → W (31 classes) by ResNet, DANN, CDAN-f, and CDAN-fg. The source and target are not aligned well with ResNet, better aligned with DANN but categories are not discriminated well. They are aligned better and categories are discriminated better by CDAN-f, while CDAN-fg is evidently better than CDAN-f. This shows the benefit of conditioning adversarial adaptation on discriminative predictions.</p></div>
