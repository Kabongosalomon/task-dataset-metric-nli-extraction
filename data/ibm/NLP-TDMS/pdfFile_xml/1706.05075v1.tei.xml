<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Joint extraction of entities and relations is to detect entity mentions and recognize their semantic relations simultaneously from unstructured text, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows. Different from open information extraction (Open IE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Banko et al., 2007</ref>) whose relation words are extracted from the given sentence, in this task, relation words are extracted from a predefined relation set which may not appear in the given sentence. It is an important issue in knowledge extraction and automatic construction of knowledge base. Traditional methods handle this task in a pipelined manner, i.e., extracting the entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)</ref> first and then recognizing their relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rink, 2010)</ref>. This separated framework makes the task easy to deal with, and each component can be more flexible. But it neglects the relevance between these two sub-tasks and each subtask is an independent model. The results of entity recognition may affect the performance of relation classification and lead to erroneous delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Li and Ji, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Different from the pipelined methods, joint learning framework is to extract entities together with relations using a single model. It can effectively integrate the information of entities and relations, and it has been shown to achieve better results in this task. However, most existing joint methods are feature-based structured systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Li and Ji, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Miwa and Sasaki, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yu and Lam, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ren et al., 2017)</ref>. They need complicated feature engineering and heavily rely on the other NLP toolkits, which might also lead to error propagation. In order to reduce the manual work in feature extraction, recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miwa and Bansal, 2016)</ref> presents a neural network-based method for the end-to-end entities and relations extraction. Although the joint models can represent both entities and relations with shared parameters in a single model, they also extract the entities and relations separately and produce redundant information. For instance, the sentence in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> contains three entities: "United States", "Trump" and "Apple Inc". But only "United States" and "Trump" hold a fix relation "Country-President". Entity "Apple Inc" has no obvious relationship with the other entities in this sentence. Hence, the extracted result from this sentence is {United States e1 , Country-President r , Trump e2 }, which called triplet here.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the extraction of triplets that are composed of two entities and one relation between these two entities. Therefore, we can model the triplets directly, rather than extracting the entities and relations separately. Based on the motivations, we propose a tagging scheme accompanied with the end-to-end model to settle this problem. We design a kind of novel tags which contain the information of entities and the relationships they hold. Based on this tagging scheme, the joint extraction of entities and relations can be transformed into a tagging problem. In this way, we can also easily use neural networks to model the task without complicated feature engineering.</p><p>Recently, end-to-end models based on LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> have been successfully applied to various tagging tasks: Named Entity Recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lample et al., 2016)</ref>, CCG Supertagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Vaswani et al., 2016)</ref>, Chunking <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zhai et al., 2017)</ref> et al. LSTM is capable of learning long-term dependencies, which is beneficial to sequence modeling tasks. Therefore, based on our tagging scheme, we investigate different kinds of LSTM-based end-to-end models to jointly extract the entities and relations. We also modify the decoding method by adding a biased loss to make it more suitable for our special tags.</p><p>The method we proposed is a supervised learning algorithm. In reality, however, the process of manually labeling a training set with a large number of entity and relation is too expensive and error-prone. Therefore, we conduct experiments on a public dataset 1 which is produced by distant supervision method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017)</ref> to validate our approach. The experimental results show that our tagging scheme is effective in this task. In addition, our end-to-end model can achieve the best results on the public dataset.</p><p>The major contributions of this paper are: (1) A novel tagging scheme is proposed to jointly extract entities and relations, which can easily transform the extraction problem into a tagging task. (2) Based on our tagging scheme, we study different kinds of end-to-end models to settle the problem. The tagging-based methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning methods. (3) Furthermore, we also develop an end-to-1 https://github.com/shanzhenren/CoType end model with biased loss function to suit for the novel tags. It can enhance the association between related entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Works</head><p>Entities and relations extraction is an important step to construct a knowledge base, which can be benefit for many NLP tasks. Two main frameworks have been widely used to solve the problem of extracting entity and their relationships. One is the pipelined method and the other is the joint learning method.</p><p>The pipelined method treats this task as two separated tasks, i.e., named entity recognition (NER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)</ref> and relation classification (RC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rink, 2010)</ref>.

Existing methods for relation classification can also be divided into handcrafted feature based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rink, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kambhatla, 2004)</ref> and neural network based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Xu, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zheng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zeng, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu, 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">dos Santos, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While joint models extract entities and relations using a single model.

Different from the above methods, the method proposed in this paper is based on a special tagging manner, so that we can easily use end-toend model to extract results without NER and RC. end-to-end method is to map the input sentence into meaningful vectors and then back to produce a sequence. It is widely used in machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sutskever et al., 2014)</ref> and sequence tagging tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vaswani et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>We propose a novel tagging scheme and an end-toend model with biased objective function to jointly extract entities and their relations. In this section, we firstly introduce how to change the extraction problem to a tagging problem based on our tagging method. Then we detail the model we used to extract results. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is an example of how the results are tagged. Each word is assigned a label that contributes to extract the results. Tag "O" represents the "Other" tag, which means that the corresponding word is independent of the extracted results. In addition to "O", the other tags consist of three parts: the word position in the entity, the relation type, and the relation role. We use the "BIES" (Begin, Inside, End,Single) signs to represent the position information of a word in the entity. The relation type information is obtained from a predefined set of relations and the relation role information is represented by the numbers "1" and "2". An extracted result is represented by a triplet: (Entity 1 , RelationT ype, Entity 2 ). "1" means that the word belongs to the first entity in the triplet, while "2" belongs to second entity that behind the relation type. Thus, the total number of tags is N t = 2 * 4 * |R| + 1, where |R| is the size of the predefined relation set. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is an example illustrating our tagging method. The input sentence contains two triplets: {United States, Country-President, Trump} and {Apple Inc, Company-Founder, Steven Paul Jobs}, where "Country-President" and "Company-Founder" are the predefined relation types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Tagging Scheme</head><p>The words "United","States"," Trump","Apple","Inc" ,"Steven", "Paul" and "Jobs" are all related to the final extracted results. Thus they are tagged based on our special tags. For example, the word of "United" is the first word of entity "United States" and is related to the relation "Country-President", so its tag is "B-CP-1". The other entity " Trump", which is corresponding to "United States", is labeled as "S-CP-2". Besides, the other words irrelevant to the final result are labeled as "O".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">From Tag Sequence To Extracted Results</head><p>From the tag sequence in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we know that " Trump" and "United States" share the same relation type "Country-President", "Apple Inc" and "Steven Paul Jobs" share the same relation type "Company-Founder". We combine entities with the same relation type into a triplet to get the final result. Accordingly, " Trump" and "United States" can be combined into a triplet whose relation type is "Country-President". Because, the relation role of " Trump" is "2" and "United States" is "1", the final result is {United States, Country-President, Trump}. The same applies to {Apple Inc, Company-Founder, Steven Paul Jobs}.</p><p>Besides, if a sentence contains two or more triplets with the same relation type, we combine every two entities into a triplet based on the nearest principle. For example, if the relation type "Country-President" in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is "Company-Founder", then there will be four entities in the given sentence with the same relation type. "United States" is closest to entity " Trump" and the "Apple Inc" is closest to "Jobs", so the results will be {United States, Company-Founder, Trump} and {Apple Inc, Company-Founder, Steven Paul Jobs}.</p><p>In this paper, we only consider the situation where an entity belongs to a triplet, and we leave identification of overlapping relations for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The End-to-end Model</head><p>In recent years, end-to-end model based on neural network is been widely used in sequence tagging task. In this paper, we investigate an end-toend model to produce the tags sequence as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3</ref> shows. It contains a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layer to encode the input sentence and a LSTM-based decoding layer with biased loss. The biased loss can enhance the relevance of entity tags. The Bi-LSTM Encoding Layer. In sequence tagging problems, the Bi-LSTM encoding layer has been shown the effectiveness to capture the semantic information of each word. It contains forward lstm layer, backward lstm layer and the concatenate layer. The word embedding layer converts the word with 1-hot representation to an embedding vector. Hence, a sequence of words can be represented as  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Gold standard annotation for an example sentence based on our tagging scheme, where "CP" is short for "Country-President" and "CF" is short for "Company-Founder". corresponding to the t-th word in the sentence and n is the length of the given sentence. After word embedding layer, there are two parallel LSTM layers: forward LSTM layer and backward LSTM layer. The LSTM architecture consists of a set of recurrently connected subnets, known as memory blocks. Each time-step is a LSTM memory block. The LSTM memory block in Bi-LSTM encoding layer is used to compute current hidden vector h t based on the previous hidden vector h t−1 , the previous cell vector c t−1 and the current input word embedding w t . Its structure diagram is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3 (b)</ref>, and detail operations are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W = {w 1 , ...w t , w t+1 ...w n }, where w t ∈ R d is the d-dimensional word vector</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">i t = δ(W wi w t + W hi h t−1 + W ci c t−1 + b i ), (1) f t = δ(W wf w t +W hf h t−1 +W cf c t−1 +b f ), (2) z t = tanh(W wc w t + W hc h t−1 + b c ), (3) c t = f t c t−1 + i t z t ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">o t = δ(W wo w t + W ho h t−1 + W co c t + b o ),<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">h t = o t tanh(c t ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where i, f and o are the input gate, forget gate and output gate respectively, b is the bias term, c is the cell memory, and W (.) are the parameters. For each word w t , the forward LSTM layer will encode w t by considering the contextual information from word w 1 to w t , which is marked as − → h t . In the similar way, the backward LSTM layer will encode w t based on the contextual information from w n to w t , which is marked as ← − h t . Finally, we concatenate ← − h t and − → h t to represent word t's encoding information, denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h t = [ − → h t , ← − h t ].</formula><p>The LSTM Decoding Layer. We also adopt a LSTM structure to produce the tag sequence. When detecting the tag of word w t , the inputs of decoding layer are: h t obtained from Bi-LSTM encoding layer, former predicted tag embedding T t−1 , former cell value c (2) t−1 , and the former hidden vector in decoding layer h (2) t−1 . The structure diagram of the memory block in LSTM d is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3 (c)</ref>, and detail operations are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">i (2) t = δ(W (2) wi h t + W (2) hi h (2) t−1 + W ti T t−1 + b (2) i ),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">f (2) t = δ(W (2) wf h t + W (2) hf h (2) t−1 + W tf T t−1 + b (2) f ),<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">z (2) t = tanh(W (2) wc h t +W (2) hc h (2) t−1 +W tc T t−1 +b (2) c ),<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">c (2) t = f (2) t c (2) t−1 + i (2) t z (2) t ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">o (2) t = δ(W (2) wo h t + W (2) ho h (2) t−1 + W (2) co c (2) t + b (2) o ),<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">h (2) t = o (2) t tanh(c (2) t ),<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">T t = W ts h (2) t + b ts .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>The final softmax layer computes normalized entity tag probabilities based on the tag predicted vector T t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">y t = W y T t + b y ,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">p i t = exp(y i t ) Nt j=1 exp(y j t ) ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where W y is the softmax matrix, N t is the total number of tags. Because T is similar to tag embedding and LSTM is capable of learning long-term dependencies, the decoding manner can model tag interactions. The Bias Objective Function. We train our model to maximize the log-likelihood of the data and the optimization method we used is RM-Sprop proposed by Hinton in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Tieleman and Hinton, 2012)</ref>. The objective function can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L =max |D| j=1 L j t=1 (log(p (j) t = y (j) t |x j , Θ) · I(O) +α · log(p (j) t = y (j) t |x j , Θ) · (1 − I(O))),</formula><p>where |D| is the size of training set, L j is the length of sentence x j , y (j) t is the label of word t in sentence x j and p (j) t is the normalized probabilities of tags which defined in Formula 15. Besides, I(O) is a switching function to distinguish the loss of tag 'O' and relational tags that can indicate the results. It is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">I(O) = 1, if tag = O 0, if tag = O .</formula><p>α is the bias weight. The larger α is, the greater influence of relational tags on the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental setting</head><p>Dataset To evaluate the performance of our methods, we use the public dataset NYT 2 which is produced by distant supervision method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017)</ref>. A large amount of training data can be obtained by means of distant supervision methods without manually labeling. While the test set is manually labeled to ensure its quality. In total, the training data contains 353k triplets, and the test set contains 3, 880 triplets. Besides, the size of relation set is 24.</p><p>Evaluation We adopt standard Precision (Prec), Recall (Rec) and F1 score to evaluate the results. Different from classical methods, our method can extract triplets without knowing the information of entity types. In other words, we did not use the label of entity types to train the model, therefore we do not need to consider the entity types in the evaluation. A triplet is regarded as correct when its relation type and the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct. Besides, the groundtruth relation mentions are given and "None" label is excluded as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li and Ji, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Miwa and Bansal, 2016)</ref> did. We create a validation set by randomly sampling 10% data from test set and use the remaining data as evaluation based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017)</ref>'s suggestion. We run 10 times for each experiment then report the average results and their standard deviation as <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows.</p><p>Hyperparameters Our model consists of a Bi-LSTM encoding layer and a LSTM decoding layer with bias objective function. The word embeddings used in the encoding part are initialed by running word2vec 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> on NYT training corpus. The dimension of the word embeddings is d = 300. We regularize our network using dropout on embedding layer and the dropout ratio is 0.5. The number of lstm units in encoding layer is 300 and the number in decoding layer is 600. The bias parameter α corresponding to the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> is 10.</p><p>2 The dataset can be downloaded at: https://github.com/shanzhenren/CoType. There are three data sets in the public resource and we only use the NYT dataset. Because more than 50% of the data in BioInfer has overlapping relations which is beyond the scope of this paper. As for dataset Wiki-KBP, the number of relation type in the test set is more than that of the train set, which is also not suitable for a supervised training method.

These methods are:</p><p>(1) DS-logistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mintz et al., 2009</ref>) is a distant supervised and feature based method, which combines the advantages of supervised IE and unsupervised IE features; (2) LINE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Tang et al., 2015)</ref> is a network embedding method, which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks;</p><p>(3) FCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Gormley et al., 2015</ref>) is a compositional model that combines lexicalized linguistic context and word embeddings for relation extraction.</p><p>The jointly extracting methods used in this paper are listed as follows: (4) DS-Joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Li and Ji, 2014</ref>) is a supervised method, which jointly extracts entities and relations using structured perceptron on human-annotated dataset; (5) MultiR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hoffmann et al., 2011)</ref> is a typical distant supervised method based on multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data; (6) CoType <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017</ref>) is a domain independent framework by jointly embedding entity mentions, relation mentions, text features and type labels into meaningful representations.</p><p>In addition, we also compare our method with two classical end-to-end tagging models: LSTM-CRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lample et al., 2016)</ref> and LSTM-LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Vaswani et al., 2016)</ref>. LSTM-CRF is proposed for entity recognition by using a bidirectional LSTM to encode input sentence and a conditional random fields to predict the entity tag sequence. Different from LSTM-CRF, LSTM-LSTM uses a LSTM layer to decode the tag sequence instead of CRF. They are used for the first time to jointly extract entities and relations based on our tagging scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Results</head><p>We report the results of different methods as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. It can be seen that our method, LSTM-LSTM-Bias, outperforms all other methods in F1 score and achieves a 3% improvement in F 1 over the best method CoType <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ren et al., 2017)</ref>. It shows the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, we also can see that the jointly extracting methods are better than pipelined methods, and the tagging methods are better than most of the jointly extracting methods. It also validates the validity of our tagging scheme for the task of jointly extracting entities and relations.</p><p>When compared with the traditional methods, the precisions of the end-to-end models are significantly improved. But only LSTM-LSTM-Bias can be better to balance the precision and recall. The reason may be that these end-to-end models all use a Bi-LSTM encoding input sentence and different neural networks to decode the results. The methods based on neural networks can well fit the data. Therefore, they can learn the common features of the training set well and may lead to the lower expansibility. We also find that the LSTM-LSTM  model is better than LSTM-CRF model based on our tagging scheme. Because, LSTM is capable of learning long-term dependencies and CRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lafferty et al., 2001)</ref> is good at capturing the joint probability of the entire sequence of labels. The related tags may have a long distance from each other. Hence, LSTM decoding manner is a little better than CRF. LSTM-LSTM-Bias adds a bias weight to enhance the effect of entity tags and weaken the effect of invalid tag. Therefore, in this tagging scheme, our method can be better than the common LSTM-decoding methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Error Analysis</head><p>In this paper, we focus on extracting triplets composed of two entities and a relation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> has shown the predict results of the task. It treats an triplet is correct only when the relation type and the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct. In order to find out the factors that affect the results of end-to-end models, we analyze the performance on predicting each element in the triplet as <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows. E1 and E2 represent the performance on predicting each entity, respectively. If the head offset of the first entity is correct, then the instance of E1 is correct, the same to E2. Regardless of relation type, if the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct, the instance of (E1, E2) is correct.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, (E1, E2) has higher precision when compared with E1 and E2. But its recall result is lower than E1 and E2. It means that some of the predicted entities do not form a pair. They only obtain E1 and do not find its corresponding E2, or obtain E2 and do not find its corresponding E1. Thus it leads to the prediction of more single E and less (E1, E2) pairs. Therefore, entity pair (E1, E2) has higher precision and lower recall than single E. Besides, the predicted results of (E1, E2) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> have about 3% improvement when compared predicted results in Table 1, which means that 3% of the test data is pre-dicted to be wrong because the relation type is predicted to be wrong.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Analysis of Biased Loss</head><p>Different from LSTM-CRF and LSTM-LSTM, our approach is biased towards relational labels to enhance links between entities. In order to further analyze the effect of the bias objective function, we visualize the ratio of predicted single entities for each end-to-end method as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. The single entities refer to those who cannot find their corresponding entities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows whether it is E1 or E2, our method can get a relatively low ratio on the single entities. It means that our method can effectively associate two entities when compared LSTM-CRF and LSTM-LSTM which pay little attention to the relational tags.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single E1</head><p>Single <ref type="formula">E2</ref>  Besides, we also change the Bias Parameter α from 1 to 20, and the predicted results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. If α is too large, it will affect the accuracy of prediction and if α is too small, the recall will decline. When α = 10, LSTM-LSTM-Bias can balance the precision and recall, and can achieve the best F1 scores.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Case Study</head><p>In this section, we observe the prediction results of end-to-end methods, and then select several representative examples to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods as <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows. Each example contains three row, the first row is the gold standard, the second and the third rows are the extracted results of model LSTM-LSTM and LSTM-LSTM-Bias respectively. S1 represents the situation that the distance between the two interrelated entities is far away from each other, which is more difficult to detect their relationships. When compared with LSTM-LSTM, LSTM-LSTM-Bias uses a bias objective function which enhance the relevance between entities. Therefore, in this example, LSTM-LSTM-Bias can extract two related entities, while LSTM-LSTM can only extract one entity of "Florida" and can not detect entity "Panama City Beach". S2 is a negative example that shows these methods may mistakenly predict one of the entity. There are no indicative words between entities N uremberg and Germany. Besides, the patten "a * of *" between Germany and M iddleAges may be easy to mislead the models that there exists a relation of "Contains" between them. The problem can be solved by adding some samples of this kind of expression patterns to the training data.</p><p>S3 is a case that models can predict the entities' head offset right, but the relational role is wrong. LSTM-LSTM treats both "Stephen A. Schwarzman" and "Blackstone Group" as entity E1, and can not find its corresponding E2. Although, LSTM-LSMT-Bias can find the entities pair (E1, E2), it reverses the roles of "Stephen A. Schwarzman" and "Blackstone Group". It shows that LSTM-LSTM-Bias is able to better on pre-dicting entities pair, but it remains to be improved in distinguishing the relationship between the two entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a novel tagging scheme and investigate the end-to-end models to jointly extract entities and relations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. But it still has shortcoming on the identification of the overlapping relations. In the future work, we will replace the softmax function in the output layer with multiple classifier, so that a word can has multiple tags. In this way, a word can appear in multiple triplet results, which can solve the problem of overlapping relations. Although, our model can enhance the effect of entity tags, the association between two corresponding entities still requires refinement in next works.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The [United States]E-loc President [Trump]E-per will visit the [Apple Inc]E-Org .
