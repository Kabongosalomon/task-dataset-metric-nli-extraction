<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Consistency regularization describes a class of approaches that have yielded ground breaking results in semi-supervised classification problems. Prior work has established the cluster assumption -under which the data distribution consists of uniform class clusters of samples separated by low density regions -as important to its success. We analyze the problem of semantic segmentation and find that its' distribution does not exhibit low density regions separating classes and offer this as an explanation for why semisupervised segmentation is a challenging problem, with only a few reports of success. We then identify choice of augmentation as key to obtaining reliable performance without such low-density regions. We find that adapted variants of the recently proposed CutOut and CutMix augmentation techniques yield state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation results in standard datasets. Furthermore, given its challenging nature we propose that semantic segmentation acts as an effective acid test for evaluating semi-supervised regularizers. Implementation at: https://github.com/ Britefury/cutmix-semisup-seg.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The effectiveness of consistency regularization is often attributed to the smoothness assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or cluster assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. The smoothness assumption states that samples close to each other are likely to have the same label. The cluster assumption -a special case of the smoothness assumption -states that decision surfaces should lie in low density regions of the data distribution. This typically holds in classification tasks, where most successes of consistency regularization have been reported so far.</p><p>At a high level, semantic segmentation is classification, where each pixel is classified based on its neighbourhood. It is therefore intriguing that there are only two reports of consistency regularization being successfully applied to segmentation from the medical imaging community <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> and none for natural photographic images. We make the observation that the L 2 pixel content distance between patches centered on neighbouring pixels varies smoothly even when the class of the center pixel changes, and thus there are no low-density regions along class boundaries. This alarming observation leads us to investigate the conditions that can allow consistency regularization to operate in these circumstances.</p><p>We find mask-based augmentation strategies to be effective for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, with an adapted variant of CutMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> realizing significant gains.</p><p>The key contributions of our paper are our analysis of the data distribution of semantic segmentation and the simplicity of our approach. We utilize tried and tested semi-supervised learning approaches, and adapt CutMix -an augmentation technique for supervised classification -for semi-supervised learning and for segmentation, achieving state of the art results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Our work relates to prior art in three areas: recent regularization techniques for classification, semi-supervised classification with a focus on consistency regularization, and semantic segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">MixUp, Cutout, and CutMix</head><p>The MixUp regularizer of Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> improves the performance of supervised image, speech and tabular data classifiers by using interpolated samples during training. The inputs and target labels of two randomly chosen examples are blended using a randomly chosen factor.</p><p>The Cutout regularizer of Devries et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> augments an image by masking a rectangular region to zero. The recently proposed CutMix regularizer of Yun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> combines aspects of MixUp and CutOut, cutting a rectangular region from image B and pasting it over image A. MixUp, Cutout, and CutMix improve supervised classification performance, with CutMix outperforming the other two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semi-supervised classification</head><p>A wide variety of consistency regularization based semi-supervised classification approaches have been proposed in the literature. They normally combine a standard supervised loss term (e.g. cross-entropy loss) with an unsupervised consistency loss term that encourages consistent predictions in response to perturbations applied to unsupervised samples.</p><p>The Π-model of Laine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> passes each unlabeled sample through a classifier twice, applying two realizations of a stochastic augmentation process, and minimizes the squared difference between the resulting class probability predictions. Their temporal model and the model of Sajjadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> encourage consistency between the current and historical predictions. Miyato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> replaced the stochastic augmentation with adversarial directions, thus aiming perturbations toward the decision boundary.</p><p>The mean teacher model of Tarvainen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> encourages consistency between predictions of a student network and a teacher network whose weights are an exponential moving average <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> of those of the student. Mean teacher was used for domain adaptation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The Unsupervised data augmentation (UDA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and the state of the art FixMatch model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> demonstrate the benefit of rich data augmentation as both combine CutOut <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with RandAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (UDA) or CTAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (FixMatch). RandAugment and CTAugment draw from a repertoire of 14 image augmentations.</p><p>Interpolation consistency training (ICT) of Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and MixMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> both combine MixUp <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> with consistency regularization. ICT uses the mean teacher model and applies MixUp to unsupervised samples, blending input images along with teacher class predictions to produce a blended input and target to train the student.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Semantic segmentation</head><p>Most semantic segmentation networks transform an image classifier into a fully convolutional network that produces a dense set of predictions for overlapping input windows, segmenting input images of arbitrary size <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The DeepLab v3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> architecture increases localization accuracy by combining atrous convolutions with spatial pyramid pooling. Encoderdecoder networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> use skip connections to connect an image classifier like encoder to a decoder. The encoder downsamples the input progressively, while the decoder upsamples, producing an output whose resolution natively matches the input.</p><p>A number of approaches for semi-supervised semantic segmentation use additional data. Kalluri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> use data from two datasets from different domains, maximizing the similarity between per-class embeddings from each dataset. Stekovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> use depth images and enforced geometric constraints between multiple views of a 3D scene.</p><p>Relatively few approaches operate in a strictly semi-supervised setting. Hung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Mittal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> employ GAN-based adversarial learning, using a discriminator network that distinguishes real from predicted segmentation maps to guide learning.</p><p>The only successful applications of consistency regularisation to segmentation that we are aware of come from the medical imaging community; Perone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> apply consistency regularization to an MRI volume dataset and to skin lesions respectively. Both approaches use standard augmentation to provide perturbation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Consistency regularization for semantic segmentation</head><p>Consistency regularization adds a consistency loss term L cons to the loss that is minimized during training <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In a classification task, L cons measures a distance d(·, ·) between the predictions resulting from applying a neural network f θ to an unsupervised sample x and a perturbed versionx of the same sample, i.e., L cons = d( f θ (x), f θ (x)). The perturbation used to generatex depends on the variant of consistency regularization used. A variety of distance measures d(·, ·) have been used, e.g., squared distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> or cross-entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The benefit of the cluster assumption is supported by the formal analysis of Athiwaratkun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They analyze a simplified Π-model <ref type="bibr">[</ref> for perturbation (x = x + εN (0, 1)) and find that the expected value of L cons is approximately proportional to the squared magnitude of the Jacobian J f θ (x) of the networks outputs with respect to its inputs. Minimizing L cons therefore flattens the decision function in the vicinity of unsupervised samples, moving the decision boundary -and its surrounding region of high gradient -into regions of low sample density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Why semi-supervised semantic segmentation is challenging</head><p>We view semantic segmentation as sliding window patch classification with the goal of identifying the class of the patch's central pixel. Given that prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> apply perturbations to the raw pixel (input) space our analysis of the data distribution focuses on the raw pixel content of image patches, rather than higher level features from within the network. We attribute the infrequent success of consistency regularization in natural image semantic segmentation problems to the observations that low density regions in input data do not align well with class boundaries. The presence of such low density regions would manifest as locally larger than average L 2 distances between patches centred on neighbouring pixels that lie either side of a class boundary. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> we visualise the L 2 distances between neighbouring patches. When using a reasonable receptive field as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (c) we can see that the cluster assumption is clearly violated: how much the raw pixel content of the receptive field of one pixel differs from the contents of the receptive field of a neighbouring pixel has little correlation with whether the patches' center pixels belong to the same class.</p><p>The lack of variation in the patchwise distances is easy to explain from a signal processing perspective. With patch of size H ×W , the distance map of L 2 distances between the pixel content of overlapping patches centered on all pairs of horizontally neighbouring pixels can be written as (∆ x I) •2 * 1 H×W , where * denotes convolution and ∆ x I is the horizontal gradient of the input image I. The element-wise squared gradient image is thus low-pass filtered by a H ×W box filter 1 , which suppresses the fine details found in the high frequency components of the image, leading to smoothly varying sample density across the image.</p><p>Our analysis of the CITYSCAPES dataset quantifies the challenges involved in placing a decision boundary between two neighbouring pixels that should belong to different classes, while generalizing to other images. We find that the L 2 distance between patches centred on pixels on either side of a class boundary is ∼ 1 /3 of the distance to the closest patch of the same class found in a different image (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). This suggests that precise positioning and orientation of the decision boundary are essential for good performance. We discuss our analysis in further detail in our supplemental material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Consistency regularization without the cluster assumption</head><p>When considered in the context of our analysis above, the few reports of the successful application of consistency regularization to semantic segmentation -in particular the work of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> -lead us to conclude that the presence of low density regions separating classes is highly beneficial, but not essential. We therefore suggest an alternative mechanism: that of using non-isotropic natural perturbations such as image augmentation to constrain the orientation of the decision boundary to lie parallel to the directions of perturbation (see the appendix of Athiwaratkun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). We will now explore this using a 2D toy example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3a</ref> illustrates the benefit of the cluster assumption with a simple 2D toy mean teacher experiment, in which the cluster assumption holds due to the presence of a gap seperating the unsupervised samples that belong to two different classes. The perturbation used for L cons is an isotropic Gaussian nudge to both coordinates, and as expected, the learned decision boundary settles neatly between the two clusters. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref> the unsupervised samples are uniformly distributed and the cluster assumption is violated. In this case, the consistency loss does more harm than good; even though it successfully flattens the neighbourhood of the decision function, it does so also across the true class boundary.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3c</ref>, we plot the contours of the distance to the true class boundary. If we constrain the perturbation applied to a sample x such that the perturbedx lies on or very close to the distance contour passing through x, the resulting learned decision boundary aligns well with the true class boundary, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3d</ref>. When low density regions are not present the perturbations must be carefully chosen such that the probability of crossing the class boundary is minimised.</p><p>We propose that reliable semi-supervised segmentation is achievable provided that the augmentation/perturbation mechanism observes the following guidelines: 1) the perturbations must be varied and high-dimensional in order to sufficiently constrain the orientation of the decision boundary in the high-dimensional space of natural imagery, 2) the probability of a perturbation crossing the true class boundary must be very small compared to the amount of exploration in other dimensions, and 3) the perturbed inputs should be plausible; they should not be grossly outside the manifold of real inputs. Classic augmentation based perturbations such as cropping, scaling, rotation and colour changes have a low chance of confusing the output class and have proved to be effective in classifying natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Given that this approach has positive results in some medical image segmentation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, it is surprising that it is ineffective for natural imagery. This motivates us to search for stronger and more varied augmentations for semisupervised semantic segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">CutOut and CutMix for semantic segmentation</head><p>Cutout <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> yielded strong results in semi-supervised classification in UDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and Fix-Match <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The UDA ablation study shows Cutout contributing the lions share of the semisupervised performance, while the FixMatch ablation shows that CutOut can match the effect of the combination of 14 image operations used by CTAugment. DeVries et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> established that Cutout encourages the network to utilise a wider variety of features in order to overcome the varying combinations of parts of an image being present or masked out. This variety introduced by Cutout suggests that it is a promising candidate for segmentation.</p><p>As stated in Section 2.1, CutMix combines Cutout with MixUp, using a rectangular mask to blend input images. Given that MixUp has been successfully used in semi-supervised classification in ICT <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and MixMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we propose using CutMix to blend unsupervised samples and corresponding predictions in a similar fashion.</p><p>Preliminary experiments comparing the Π-model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the mean teacher model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> indicate that using mean teacher is essential for good performance in semantic segmentation, therefore all the experiments in this paper use the mean teacher framework. We denote the student network as f θ and the teacher network as g φ .</p><p>Cutout. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> we initialize a mask M with the value 1 and set the pixels inside a randomly chosen rectangle to 0. To apply Cutout in a semantic segmentation task, we mask the input pixels with M and disregard the consistency loss for pixels masked to 0 by M. FixMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> uses a weak augmentation scheme consisting of crops and flips to predict pseudo-labels used as targets for samples augmented using the strong CTAugment scheme. Similarly, we consider Cutout to be a form of strong augmentation, so we apply the teacher network g φ to the original image to generate pseudo-targets that are used to train the student f θ . Using square distance as the metric, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L cons = ||M ( f θ (M x) − g φ (x))|| 2 , where</formula><p>denotes an elementwise product. CutMix. CutMix requires two input images that we shall denote x a and x b that we mix with the mask M. Following ICT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>) we mix the teacher predictions for the input images g φ (x a ), g φ (x b ) producing a pseudo target for the student prediction of the mixed image. To simplify the notation, let us define function mix(a, b, M) = (1 − M) a + M b that selects the output pixel based on mask M. We can now write the consistency loss as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L cons = mix g φ (x a ), g φ (x b ), M − f θ mix(x a , x b , M) 2 .</formula><p>(1)</p><p>The original formulation of Cutout <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for classification used a rectangle of a fixed size and aspect ratio whose centre was positioned randomly, allowing part of the rectangle to lie outside the bounds of the image. CutMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> randomly varied the size, but used a fixed aspect ratio. For segmentation we obtained better performance with CutOut by randomly choosing the size and aspect ratio and positioning the rectangle so it lies entirely within the image. In contrast, CutMix performance was maximized by fixing the area of the rectangle to half that of the image, while varying the aspect ratio and position.</p><p>While the augmentations applied by Cutout and CutMix do not appear in real-life imagery, they are reasonable from a visual standpoint. Segmentation networks are frequently trained using image crops rather than full images, so blocking out a section of the image with Cutout can be seen as the inverse operation. Applying CutMix in effect pastes a rectangular region from one image onto another, similarly resulting in a reasonable segmentation task.</p><p>Cutout and CutMix based consistency loss are illustrated in our supplemental material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We will now describe our experiments and main results. We will start by describing the training setup, followed by results on the PASCAL VOC 2012, CITYSCAPES and ISIC 2017 datasets. We compare various perturbation methods in the context of semi-supervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL and ISIC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training setup</head><p>We use two segmentation networks in our experiments: 1) DeepLab v2 network <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> based on ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-101 as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and 2) Dense U-net <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> based on DensetNet-161 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We also evaluate using DeepLab v3+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and PSPNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> in our supplemental material.</p><p>We use cross-entropy for the supervised loss L sup and compute the consistency loss L cons using the Mean teacher algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Summing L cons over the class dimension and averaging over others allows us to minimize L sup and L cons with equal weighting. Further details and hyper-parameter settings are provided in supplemental material. We replace the sigmoidal ramp-up that modulates L cons in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> with the average of the thresholded confidence of the teacher network, which increases as the training progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results on Cityscapes and Augmented Pascal VOC</head><p>Here we present our results on two natural image datasets and contrast them against the state-of-the-art in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which is currently the adversarial training approach of Mittal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We use two natural image datasets in our experiments. CITYSCAPES consists of urban scenery and has 2975 images in its training set. PASCAL VOC 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is more varied, but includes only 1464 training images, and thus we follow the lead of Hung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and augment it using SEMANTIC BOUNDARIES <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, resulting in 10582 training images. We adopted the same cropping and augmentation schemes as <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to an ImageNet pre-trained DeepLab v2, Hung <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Mittal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> also used a DeepLabv2 network pre-trained for semantic segmentation on the COCO dataset, whose natural image content is similar to that of PASCAL. Their results confirm the benefits of task-specific pre-training. Starting from a pre-trained ImageNet classifier is representative of practical problems for which a similar segmentation dataset is unavailable for pre-training, so we opted to use these more challenging conditions only.</p><p>Our CITYSCAPES results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> as mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) percentages, where higher is better. Our supervised baseline results for CITYSCAPES are similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We attribute the small differences to training regime choices such as the choice of optimizer. Both the Cutout and CutMix realize improvements over the supervised baseline, with CutMix taking the lead and improving on the adversarial <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and s4GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> approaches. We note that CutMix performance is slightly impaired when full size image crops are used getting an mIoU score of 58.75% ± 0.75 for 372 labelled images. Using a mixing mask consisting of three smaller boxes -see supplemental material -whose scale better matches the image content alleviates this, obtaining 60.41% ± 1.12.</p><p>Our PASCAL results are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Our baselines are considerably weaker than those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; we acknowledge that we were unable to match them. Cutout and CutMix yield improvements over our baseline and CutMix -in spite of the weak baseline -takes the lead, ahead of the adversarial and s4GAN results. Virtual adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> yields a noticable improvement, but is unable to match competing approaches. The improvement obtained from ICT <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> is just noticable, while standard augmentation makes barely any difference.

We must first note that our supervised baseline results are noticably worse that those of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Given this limitation, we use our results to contrast the effects of the different augmentation schemes used. Our strongest semisupervised result was obtained using CutMix, followed by standard augmentation, then VAT and CutOut. We found CutMix to be the most reliable, as the other approaches required more hyper-parameter tuning effort to obtain positive resutlts. We were unable to obtain reliable performance from ICT, hence its result is worse than that of the baseline.</p><p>We propose that the good performance of standard augmentation -in contrast to PAS-CAL where it makes barely any difference -is due to the lack of variation in the dataset. An augmented variant of an unsupervised sample is sufficient similar to other samples in the dataset to successfully propagate labels, in spite of the limited varation introduced by standard augmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discussion</head><p>We initially hypothesized that the strong performance of CutMix on the CITYSCAPES and PASCAL datasets was due to the augmentation in effect 'simulating occlusion', exposing the network to a wider variety of occlusions, thereby improving performance on natural images.</p></div>

The strong performance of CutMix indicates that the presence of occlusions is not a requirement.</p><p>The success of virtual adversarial training demonstrates that exploring the space of adversarial examples provides sufficient variation to act as an effective semi-supervised regularizer in the challenging conditions posed by semantic segmentation. In contrast the small improvements obtained from ICT and the barely noticable difference made by standard augmentation on the PASCAL dataset indicates that these approaches are not suitable for this domain; we recommend using a more varied source or perturbation, such as CutMix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have demonstrated that consistency regularization is a viable solution for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, provided that an appropriate source of augmentation is used. Its data distribution lacks low-density regions between classes, hampering the effectiveness of augmentation schemes such as affine transformations and ICT. We demonstrated that richer approaches can be successful, and presented an adapted CutMix regularizer that provides sufficiently varied perturbation to enable state-of-the-art results and work reliably on natural image datasets. Our approach is considerably easier to implement and use than the previous methods based on GAN-style training.</p><p>We hypothesize that other problem domains that involve segmenting continuous signals given sliding-window input -such as audio processing -are likely to have similarly challenging distributions. This suggests mask-based regularization as a potential avenue.</p><p>Finally, we propose that the challenging nature of the data distribution present in semantic segmentation indicates that it is an effective acid test for evaluating future semisupervised regularizers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Smoothly varying sample density in semantic segmentation B.1 Derivation of signal processing explanation</head><p>In this section we explain the derivation of our signal-processing based explanation of the lack of low-density regions in semantic segmentation problems.</p><p>To analyse the smoothness of the distribution of patches over an image we need to compute the L 2 pixel content distance between patches centred on neighbouring pixels. Let us start with two patches A and B -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>(a,b) -extracted from an image I, centred on horizontally neighbouring pixels, with A one pixel to the left of B. The L 2 distance is |B − A|. Given that each pixel in B − A is the difference between horizontally neighbouring pixels, B − A is therefore a patch extracted from the horizontal gradient image ∆ x I (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>(c)). The squared distance is the sum of the element-wise squares of B − A; it is the sum of the elements in a patch extracted from (∆ x I) •2 . Computing the sums of all patches of size H ×W in a sliding window fashion across (∆ x I) •2 is equivalent to convolving it with a box kernel 1 H×W , thus the distance between all horizontally neighbouring patches can be computed using (∆ x I) •2 * 1 H×W . A box filter -or closely related uniform filter -is a low-pass filter that will suppress high-frequency details, resulting in a smooth output. This is implemented in a Jupyter notebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that is distributed with our code. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Analysis of patch-to-patch distances within Cityscapes</head><p>Our analysis of the CITYSCAPES indicates that semantic segmentation problems exhibit high intra-class variance and low inter-class variance. We chose 1000 image patch triplets each consisting of an anchor patch A i and positive P i and negative N i patches with the same and different ground truth classes as A i respectively. We used the L 2 pixel content intra-class distance |P i − A i | 2 and inter-class distance |N i − A i | 2 as proxies for variance. Given that a segmentation model must place a decision boundary between neighbouring pixels of different classes within an image we chose A i and N i to be immediate neighbours on either side of a class boundary. As the model must also generalise from a labelled images to unlabelled images we searched all images except that containing A i for the P i belonging to the same class that minimises |P i − A i | 2 . Minimising the distance chooses the best case intra-class distance over which the model must generalise. The inter-class to intra-class distance ratio histogram on the left of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> underlies the illustration to the right in which the blue intraclass distance is approximately 3× that of the red inter-class distance. The model must learn to place the decision boundary between the patches centred on neighbouring pixels, while orienting it sufficiently accurately that it intersects other images at the correct points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Setup: 2D toy experimnents</head><p>The neural networks used in our 2D toy experiments are simple classifiers in which samples are 2D x, y points ranging from -1 to 1. Our networks are multi-layer perceptrons consisting of 3 hidden layers of 512 units, each followed by a ReLU non-linearity. The final layer is a 2-unit classification layer. We use the mean teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> semi-supervised learning algorithm with binary cross-entropy as the consistency loss function, a consistency loss weight of 10 and confidence thresholding <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with a threshold of 0.97. The ground truth decision boundary was derived from a hand-drawn 512×512 pixel image. The distance map shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(c) was computed using the scipy.ndimage. morphology.distance_transform_edt function from SciPy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, with distances negated for regions assigned to class 0. Each pixel in the distance map therefore has a signed distance to the ground truth class boundary. This distance map was used to generate the countours seen as lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>(c) and used to support the constrained consistency regularization experiment illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3(d)</ref>.</p><p>The constrained consistency regularization experiment described in Section 3.2 required that a sample x should be perturbed tox such that they are at the same -or similardistance to the ground truth decision boundary. This was achieved by drawing isotropic perturbations from a normal distrubtionx = x + h where h ∼ N (0, 0.117) (0.117 ≈ 30 pixels in the source image), determining the distances m(x) and m(x) from x andx to the ground truth boundary (using a pre-computed distance map) and discarding the perturbation -by masking consistency loss for x to 0 -if |m(x) − m(x)| &gt; 0.016 (0.016 ≈ 4 pixels in the source image).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Semantic segmentation experiment setup D.1 Adapting semi-supervised classification algorithms for segmentation</head><p>In the main paper we explain how we adapted Cutout <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and CutMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> for segmentation.</p><p>Here we will discuss our approach to adapting standard augmentation, Interpolation Consistency Training (ICT) and Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT). We note that implementations of all of these approaches are supplied with our source code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1.1 Standard augmentation</head><p>Our standard augmentation based consistency loss uses affine transformations to modify unsupervised images. Applying different affine transformations within the teacher and student paths results in predictions that not aligned. An appropriate affine transformation must be used to bring them into alignment. To this end, we follow the approch used by Perone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; the original unaugmented image x is passed to the teacher network g φ producting predictions g φ (x), aligned with the original image. The image is augmented with an affine transformation a(·):x = a(x), which is passed to the student network f θ producting predictions f θ (a(x)). The same transformation is applied to the teacher prediction: a(g φ (x)). The two predictions are now geometrically aligned, allowing consistency loss to be computed. At this point we would like to note some of the challenges involved in the implementation. A natural approach would be to use a single system for applying affine transformations, e.g. the affine grid functionality provided by PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; that way both the input images and the predictions can be augmented using the same transformation matrices. We however wishe to exactly match the augmentation system used by Hung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Mittal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, both of which use functions provided by OpenCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This required gathering a precise understanding of how the relevant functions in OpenCV generate and apply affine transformation matrices in order to match them using PyTorch's affine grid functionality, that must be used to transform predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1.2 Interpolation consistency training</head><p>ICT was the simplest approach to adapt. We follow the procedure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, except that our networks generate pixel-wise class probability vectors. These are blended and loss is com-  <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Illustration of mixing regularization for semi-supervised semantic segmentation with the mean teacher framework. f θ and g φ denote the student and teacher networks, respectively. The arbitrary mask M is omitted from the argument list of function mix for legibility.</p><p>puted from them in the same fashion as <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>; the only different is that the arrays/tensors have additional dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1.3 Virtual Adversarial Training</head><p>Following the notation of Oliver et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, in a classification scenario VAT computes the adversarial perturbation r adv as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r ∼ N (0, ξ dim(x) I) g = ∇ r d( f θ (x), f θ (x + r)) r adv = ε g ||g||</formula><p>We adopt exactly the same approach, computing the adversarial perturbation that maximises the mean of the change in class prediction for all pixels of the output.</p><p>We scale the adversarial radius ε adaptively on a per-image basis by multiplying it by the magnitude of the gradient of the input image. We find that a scale of 1 works well and used this in our experiments. We also tried using a fixed value for ε -as normally used in VAT -and found that doing so caused a slight but statistically insignificant reduction in performance. We therefore recommend the adaptive radius on the basis of ease of use. It is implemented in our source code.</p></div>

Note that we include additional detail in final steps of the computation of L cons in comparison to <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> in order to illustrate the masking of the consistency loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.3 CutMix with full-sized crops on CITYSCAPES</head><p>As stated in our main text, when using the CITYSCAPES dataset, using full size image crops -1024 × 512 rather than the usual 512 × 256 -impairs the performance of semi-supervised learning using CutMix regularization, reducing the mIoU score from 60.34% ± 1.24 to 58.75% ± 0.75. We believe that optimal performance is obtained when the scale of the elements in the mixing mask are appropriately matched to the scale of the image content. We can alleviate this reduction in perofmrnace by constructing our mixing mask by randomly choosing three smaller boxes whose area is 1 /3 of that used for one box (the normal case). Given that a CutMix mask consisting of a single box uses a box that covers 50% of the image area (but with random aspect ratio and position), the three boxes each cover 1 /6 of the image area. The masks for the three boxes are combined using an xor operation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> contrast mixing with one-box and three-box masks. We use the Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 3 × 10 −5 . As per the mean teacher algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, after each iteration the weights w t of the teacher network are updated to be the exponential moving average of the weights w s of the student: w t = α t w t + (1 − α t )w s , where α t = 0.99. The CITYSCAPES images were downsampled to half resolution (1024 × 512) prior to use, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We extracted 512 × 256 random crops, applied random horizontal flipping and used a batch size of 4, in keeping with <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>For the PASCAL VOC experiments, we extracted 321 × 321 random crops, applied a random scale between 0.5 and 1.5 rounded to the nearest 0.1 and applyed random horzontal flipping. We used a batch size of 10, in keeping with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>We used a confidence threshold of 0.97 for all experiments. We used a consistency loss weight of 1 for both CutOut and CutMix, 0.003 for standard augmentation, 0.01 for ICT and 0.1 for VAT. Hyper-parameter tuning was performed by evaluating performance on a hold-out validation set whose samples were drawn from the PASCAL training set.</p><p>We trained for 40,000 iterations for both datasets. We also found that identical hyperparameters worked well for both using DeepLab v2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.4.2 Using ImageNet pre-trained DenseUNet for ISIC 2017</head><p>All images were scaled to 248 × 248 using area interpolation as a pre-process step. Our augmentation scheme consists of random 224 × 224 crops, flips, rotations and uniform scaling in the range 0.9 to 1.1.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> our standard augmentation based experiments allow the samples passing through the teacher and student paths to be arbitrarily rotated and scaled with respect to one another (within the ranges specified above), where as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> use rotations of integer multiples of 90 degrees and flips.</p><p>All of our ISIC 2017 experiments use SGD with Nesterov momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (momentum value of 0.9) with a learning rate of 0.05 and weight decay of 5 × 10 −4 . For Cutout and CutMix we used a consistency weight of 1, for standard augmentation 0.1 and for VAT 0.1.</p><p>We would like to note that scaling the shortest dimension of each image to 248 pixels while preserving aspect ratio reduced performance; the non-uniform scale in the preprocessing step acts as a form of data augmentation.</p></div>

We had to modify 3 their code in order to use our loss functions. We note that we did not use the auxiliary loss from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, known as the deep supervision trick in the MIT CSAIL GitHUb repository.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.4.4 Confidence thresholding</head><p>[15] apply confidence thresholding, in which they mask consistency loss to 0 for samples whose confidence as predicted by the teacher network is below a threshold of 0.968. In the context of segmentation, we found that this masks pixels close to class boundaries as they usually have a low confidence. These regions are often large enough to encompass small objects, preventing learning and degrading performance. Instead we modulate the consistency loss with the proportion of pixels whose confidence is above the threshold. This values grows throughout training, taking the place of the sigmoidal ramp-up used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.4.5 Consistency loss with squared error</head><p>Most implementations of consistency loss that use squared error (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) compute the mean of the squared error over all dimensions. In contrast we sum over the class probability dimension and computing the mean over the spatial and batch dimensions. This is more in keeping with the definition of other loss functions use with probability vectors such as cross-entropy and KL-divergence. We also found that this reduces the necessity of scaling the consistency weight with the number of classes; as is required then taking the mean over the class probability dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Left: histogram of the ratio |N i −A i | 2 /|P i −A i | 2 of the L 2 pixel content inter-class distance between patches A i and N i centred on neighbouring pixels either side of class boundary to the intra-class distance between nearest neighbour patches A i and P i coming from different images.
