<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recent random-forest (RF)-based image super-resolution approaches inherit some properties from dictionary-learning-based algorithms, but the effectiveness of the properties in RF is overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we present a novel feature-augmented random forest (FARF) for image super-resolution, where the conventional gradient-based features are augmented with gradient magnitudes and different feature recipes are formulated on different stages in an RF. The advantages of our method are that, firstly, the dictionary-learning-based features are enhanced by adding gradient magnitudes, based on the observation that the non-linear gradient magnitude are with highly discriminative property. Secondly, generalized locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is used to replace principal component analysis (PCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and original high-dimensional features are employed, instead of the compressed ones, for the leaf-nodes' regressors, since regressors can benefit from higher dimensional features. This original-compressed coupled feature sets scheme unifies the unsupervised LSH evaluation on both image super-resolution and content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Finally, we present a generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR) model for the leaf-nodes' regressors. Experiment results on several public benchmark datasets show that our FARF method can achieve an average gain of about 0.3 dB, compared to traditional RF-based methods.</p><p>Furthermore, a fine-tuned FARF model can compare to or (in many cases) outperform some recent stateof-the-art deep-learning-based algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the past few years, random forest (RF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> as a machine-learning tool, working via an ensemble of multiple decision trees, has been employed for efficient classification or regression problems, and applied to a large variety of computer-vision applications, such as object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, face alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, data clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, single image super-resolution (SISR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, and so on.</p><p>The RF method, which benefits from its simple implementation of binary trees, has been widely used, and exhibits a number of merits, including (1) it works with an ensemble of multiple decision trees to express the principle that "two heads are better than one", <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> it is easy to be sped up with parallel processing technology, on both the training and inference stages, (3) it has sub-linear search complexity, because of the use of the binary tree structure, (4) the bagging strategy for feature candidates on splitnodes enable it to handle high-dimensional features and avoid over-fitting on regression, and (5) the clustering-regression scheme employs the "divide and conquer" strategy, which can tackle the classification and regression tasks with more stable performance.</p><p>The RF-based image super-resolution approach can be considered as a clustering/classificationbased method, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. But the clustering and regression problems in RF require with different discriminative features, which have not been systematically studied in existing literature. Feature engineering has been a research hotspot for decades. Several features have been proposed for learning the mapping functions from low-resolution (LR) patches to high-resolution (HR) patches on image restoration problems. Pioneer work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> used a simple high-pass filter as simple as subtracting a low-pass filtered values from the input image raw values. Meanwhile, most algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> follow the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which concatenates the first-and second-order gradients to form the features, as an inexpensive solution to approximating high-pass filtering. Since RF is used as a dictionarylearning-based tool, it inherits many properties from the conventional dictionary-learning-based algorithms on feature extraction. However, the discriminative ability of those gradient-based features for random forest has been overlooked in the literature. We found, from experiments, that augmented features based on two gradient-magnitude filters can achieve more than 0.1dB quality improvement in RF based SISR, with the same parameter setting.</p><p>In most dictionary-learning-based algorithms, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction before classification and regression processes. The impact of using PCA has also been paid less attention in the literature. PCA projection may damage the structure of features, which are originally discriminative for clustering at the split-nodes and regression at the leaf-nodes. Motivated from content-based image retrieval (CBIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, where the coarse-level search uses compressed features, while the fine-level search uses augmented features. Therefore, in our method, we use the original features rather than the compressed features generated by PCA as worked in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, so that more accurate regression and higher image quality improvement can be achieved. Moreover, the unsupervised locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) model, instead of PCA, is employed for feature dimensionality reduction, which can reduce the damage on the feature structure for the compressed features used on clustering at the split-nodes and thus improve the final image quality.</p><p>For regression problems at the leaf-nodes, we propose a generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR) as an extension of the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. GWRR models are generated based on the data distributions from the leaf-nodes.</p><p>The main contribution of our method is on feature augmentation, so we call our method featureaugmented random forest (FARF). The pipeline of our FARF method, which includes feature extraction, the training stage, and inference stages for SISR, is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. In the FARF-based image SR scheme, higher discriminative features are extracted by using the first-and second-order gradients and their magnitudes. Then, the conventional PCA is replaced by the generalized LSH for dimensionality reduction, and the compressed features are used for clustering in the split-nodes on an RF. Finally, the respective regressors at the leaf-nodes are learned by using the original high dimensional features with the GWRR models.</p><p>Having introduced the main idea of our paper, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows.</p><p>In Section 2, we review the related works on SISR, particularly the RF-based approaches and our insights.</p><p>In Section 3, we introduce the proposed method FARF, including the discriminative feature augmented by the gradient-magnitude filters, the generalized weighted ridge regression (GWRR) model, and the fine-tuned FARF version. In Section 4, we evaluate our FARF scheme on public datasets, and conclusions are given in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Image Super-Resolution</head><p>Image SR attempts to achieve an impressive HR quality image from one or a set of LR images via artistic skills, which has been an active research topic for decades in the image restoration area. Generalized SR includes interpolation algorithms, such as the classic bicubic interpolation, and other edge-preserving algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p><p>The traditional super-resolution algorithms are based on pixel operations. Intuitively, operating on a "big pixel", i.e. a patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, is more effective. Since patch-based algorithms can preserve the local texture structure of an image, various methods based on image patches, such as non-local means <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, self-similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, manifold learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, sparse representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, etc. have been proposed.</p><p>The neighbor-embedding (NE) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> are the milestone for patch-based dictionary learning methods. NE learns the mapping between low-and high-resolution patches, with the use of manifold learning. Based on the locally linear embedding (LLE) theory, an LR patch can be represented as a linear combination of its nearest neighbors in a learned dictionary, and its HR counterpart can be approximated as a linear combination of the corresponding HR patches of its LR neighbors, with the same coefficients. Although the NE method is simple and sounds practical, a problem with the method is how to build a feasible patch dictionary. For example, for a patch size of 5×5, with 256 gray levels, it is necessary to have a massive dataset, which has millions of patches, in order to achieve high-quality reconstructed HR patches, if the patches are collected directly from natural scene images. Because of the large dictionary size, it is time consuming to search for a neighbor in such a large dataset.</p><p>Other method to reduce the dictionary size is to learn a relatively smaller dictionary with discrete cosine transform (DCT) or wavelet fixed basis, which the adaptiveness is sacrificed. In 2010, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a sparse prior for dictionary learning. Using sparse coding, image representation can work with a relatively smaller dictionary while keep the adaptiveness by learning the basis from data directly, which opens the era for sparse coding in the image inverse problems.</p><p>With the sparse constraint used in the sparse-coding super-resolution (ScSR) framework, an LR patch and its corresponding HR patch can both be reconstructed through two learned coupled dictionaries, with the same coefficients as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">≈ D , x ≈ D ℎ , ∈ R with ‖ ‖ 0 ≪ .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where and denote an LR patch and its HR counterpart, respectively, and D and D ℎ are the low and high-resolution coupled dictionaries trained jointly from LR and HR patch samples. The value of in ‖ ‖ ϑ is the sparsity factor of the coefficients . ‖ ‖ 0 , called the 0 -norm, is the non-zero count of the coefficients in . The LR and HR coupled dictionaries are trained jointly with a sparsity constraint, as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D ℎ , D = argmin D ℎ ,D ‖ − D ℎ ‖ 2 2 + ‖ − D ‖ 2 2 + ‖ ‖ 0,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>an LR patch of an input LR image Y can be formulated in terms of D as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min‖ ‖ 0 s.t. ‖D − ‖ 2 2 ≤ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">or min‖ ‖ 0 s.t. ‖ D − ‖ 2 2 ≤ ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where is a feature-extraction operator on the LR patches, which aims to extract discriminative features from LR patches, rather than using the raw pixel intensity.</p><p>Although the 0 -norm of α is an ideal regularization term for the sparse constraint, this strong constraint leads to an NP-hard problem in solving the coefficients α. Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> relaxed the 0 -norm to 1 -norm, so as to achieve a feasible solution as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min‖ ‖ 1 s.t. ‖ D − ‖ 2 2 ≤ ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and an equivalent formulation can be achieved by using the Lagrange multiplier,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">min‖ D − y‖ 2 2 + ‖ ‖ 1 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the parameter balances the sparsity of the solution and the fidelity of the approximation to .</p><p>As the sparse constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is still a bottleneck on training dictionaries considering the computation, an intuitive way to solve it is to relax the constraint again to 2 -norm. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of sparsity is challenged <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> by researchers as to whether sparsity or collaborative representation really helps in image classification and restoration. As a natural solution to that, Timofte et al. proposed an anchored neighborhood regression (ANR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> framework, where there is no sparse constraint in the model. ANR replaces the sparse-decomposition optimization ( 1 -norm) with a ridge regression (i.e. 2norm), where the coefficients can be computed offline and each coefficient can be stored as an atom (anchor) in the dictionary. This offline learning can greatly speed-up the prediction stage, and this approach has subsequently led to several variant algorithms.</p><p>Timofte et al. later extended the ANR approach to the A+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In A+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the coupled dictionaries are trained from a large pool of training samples (in the order of millions) rather than only from the anchoring atoms, which greatly improves the image quality. After that, more extensions based on ANR and A+ have emerged <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>However, in the above-mentioned dictionary-learning methods, the complexity of finding those similar patches by comparing an input patch with all the dictionary items has been overlooked. Recently, algorithms using random forest (RF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> have achieved state-of-the-art performances, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for classification and regression tasks. This is mainly due to the use of ensemble learning and sublinear search based on binary trees. Schulter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> adopted random forest and the clustering-regression scheme to learn regressors from the patches in leaf-nodes for SISR. With the same number of regressors, the RF-based algorithm can outperform or achieve comparable performance with A+ and its variants, in terms of accuracy but with less computational complexity.</p><p>In recent years, deep learning has achieved promising performances on image super-resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, milestone works on image super-resolution based on deep learning were presented, where a convolutional neural network (SRCNN) was proposed to learn an end-to-end mapping between LR and HR images for image super-resolution. Later a scheme with very deep networks for SISR was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, where the convergence rate of the deep network is improved by using residual learning and extremely high learning rates. In addition, Ledig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> introduced a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image super-resolution model (SRGAN), where the image perceptual loss function is reformulated as the combination of content loss and adversarial loss. Although deeplearning-based approaches have achieved promising progress on SISR, the heavy computational requirement is still a large burden even though the implementation is accelerated by GPU. This may limit them from those applications without powerful GPU, such as smart mobile terminals. In the inference stage, each decision tree returns a class probability ( | ) for a given test sample ∈ , and the final class label * is then obtained via averaging, as follows:</p></div>

The splitting function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">( ; Θ) = { 0, if (Θ ) &lt; Θ , 1, otherwise,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the outcome defines to which child node is routed, and 0 and 1 are the two labels belonging to the left and right child node, respectively. Each node chooses the best splitting function Θ * out of a randomly sampled set {Θ }, and the threshold Θ is determined by optimizing the following function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">= | | | |+| | ( ) + | | | |+| | ( ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where and are the sets of samples that are routed to the left and right child nodes, respectively, and | | represents the number of samples in the set . During the training of an RF, the decision trees are provided with a random subset of the training data (i.e. bagging), and are trained independently. Training a single decision tree involves recursively splitting each node, such that the training data in the newly created child node is clustered conforming to class labels. Each tree is grown until a stopping criterion is reached (e.g. the number of samples in a node is less than a threshold or the tree depth reaches a maximum value) and the class probability distributions are estimated in the leaf nodes. After fulfilling one of the stopping criteria, the density model ( ) in each leaf node is estimated by using all the samples falling into the leaf node, which will be used as a prediction of class probabilities in the inference stage. A simple way to estimate the probability distribution function ( ) is by averaging all the samples in the leaf node, and there are many variants, such as fitting a Gaussian distribution, kernel density estimation, etc.</p><p>In <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(9)</ref>, ( ) is the local score for a set of samples in S (S is either L or R), which is usually calculated by entropy, as shown in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and it can be replaced by variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> or by the Gini index <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( ) = − ∑ [ ( | ) * log( ( | ))] =1 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where is the number of classes, and ( | ) is the probability for class , which is estimated from the set .

Assuming that (. , . ) is of Gaussian distribution, and has only a set of finite samples, the differential entropy can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">( ) = 2 (1 − log(2π)) + 1 2 log(det(Σ )),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where det (Σ ) is the determinant of the estimated covariance matrix of the target variables in .</p><p>RF-based approaches hold some properties, which make them powerful classifiers as SVM (support vector machine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and AdaBoost (short for "Adaptive Boosting") <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Both SVM and AdaBoost work as to approximate the Bayes decision rule -known to be the optimal classifiers -via minimizing a margin-based global loss function.</p><p>RF-based image super-resolution (SR), following a recent emerging stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> on single-image SR, formulates the SR problem as a clustering-regression problem. These emerging approaches attempt to reconstruct an HR image from patches with the aid of an external database. These methods first decompose an image into patches, then classify the patches into different clusters, and later regressors are trained for all the clusters respectively, which generate mappings from an input LR patch's features to its corresponding HR patch. In the inference stage, an LR image follows the same procedures, such that it is divided into patches and features are extracted from each patch. Then, the patches are classified into different clusters using K-NN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> or RF <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, and their super-resolved HR patches are computed through regression in the leaf nodes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). This kind of clustering-regression-based random forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> methods has achieved state-of-the-art performance in SISR, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">FEATURE-AUGMENTED RANDOM FOREST</head><p>Classification and regression can be regarded as probability problems from the statistical theory.</p><p>Historical frequentist probability is the probability obtained from the relative frequency in a large number of trials. In contrast, the Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which probability is interpreted as an expectation taking the knowledge and personal belief into account. From the Bayesian theory, the posterior probability of a random event is a conditional probability, which can be calculated if the relevant evidence or context is considered. Therefore, the posterior probability is the probability ( | ) of the parameters given the evidence . We denote the probability distribution function of the prior for parameters as ( ), and the likelihood as ( | ), which is the probability of given . Then, based on the Bayesian rule, the posterior probability can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">( | ) = ( | ) ( ) ( ) .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>The posterior probability can be denoted in a memorable form as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∝ ℎ × .</formula><p>Based on the Bayesian framework, the likelihood term and the prior term are both required to be determined in order to solve the inverse problems, and the extracted features are normally worked as prior or likelihood, particularly on some image restoration problems. From this point of view, most research works, from classic feature extractors to deep-learning neural networks, are essentially done under the Bayesian inference framework.</p><p>Since SISR is a well-known ill-posed problem, researchers have put their efforts into the priors of the problem with skills from mathematics, computer vision and machine learning. One of the obvious and most studied priors is the edge prior, which can be found in many pioneering works: new edgedirected interpolation (NEDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, soft-decision adaptive interpolation (SAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, directional filtering and data-fusion (DFDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, modified edge-directed interpolation (MEDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and so on. The edge prior is effective on image processing, and the first and second-order gradients are studied and employed by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> in a pioneering dictionary-learning-based algorithm. However, the effect of edgebased features has not been investigated in depth. For the clustering and classification problems, feature engineering is a critical research point, and in some cases, the chosen feature may dominate the performance. As shown in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref>, a feature filter , whose coefficients are computed to fit the most relevant parts in the LR image patches, is employed, and the generated features can achieve more accurate predictions for reconstructing their counterpart HR image patches, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Augmented Features via Gradient Magnitude Filters</head><p>Normally it is unstable to directly use pixel intensities as features, which are susceptible to the environmental lighting variations and camera noise. Instead, the differences between the neighboring pixels' intensity values, which are computationally efficient, and are immune to lighting changes and noise, are examined. This type of features can be implemented efficiently through convolutional filters.</p><p>Typically, the feature filter can be chosen as a high-pass filter, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, the first and second-order gradient operators are used to generate an up-sampled version from a low-resolution image, then four patches are extracted from the gradient maps at each location, and finally the patches are concatenated to form feature vectors. The four 1-D filters used to extract the derivatives are described in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1 = [−1, 0, 1], 2 = 1 3 = [1, 0, −2, 0, 1], 4 = 3 }.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>These features can work well on dictionary-learning-based methods, because when searching a matched patch in a dictionary, the distance is calculated based on the whole feature vectors with the Euclidean distance.

Therefore, more discriminative features are required for RF, when compared with dictionary-learning-based methods. The first and second-order gradients of an image can provide the directions of edges in a perceptual manner as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>, which can be calculated as Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∇ = [ , ],<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where / and / are the gradients in the x-axis and y-axis directions, respectively, at a given pixel. Meanwhile, the gradient magnitude image can provide the edge strength, as described in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> shows a toy example of a man-made "circle" image, to demonstrate its discriminative property.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">‖∇ ‖ = √( ) 2 + ( ) 2 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>With a natural image shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>, it can be observed that the gradient magnitude image has more detailed textures than the gradient images ( / and / ), as well as the sum of the horizontal gradient and vertical gradient image, i.e. / + / , perceptually. An explanation for this phenomenon is that non-linear features are usually more discriminative. Thus, in our work, all the first and second-order gradients, and gradient magnitude are employed, and are concatenated to form more discriminative, augmented features.</p><p>On the other hand, the image orientation (gradient angle) is defined by the following formulation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">∠∇ = arctan ( / ),<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where atan( ) is the gradient orientation, with a value between -90 and 90. As shown in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>, when the value of is equal to 0 or close to 0, the value of ∠∇ becomes infinitely large and unstable, i.e., different will result in approximately the same ∠∇ value. Based on this analysis, we only use the two gradient magnitude filters derived from the four gradient filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to generate the augmented features. Experiments validate that the use of the augmented features can improve the conventional RF algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to achieve a performance gain of more than 0.1dB, which is a remarkable improvement, with the same setting and parameters.</p></div>

Inspired by the finelevel search using augmented features in CBIR frameworks, the high dimensional features in the leaf nodes in an RF can further improve the prediction accuracy in the regression step, which has not been studied previously. Consequently, we use the original features, rather than PCA or the LSH compressed features, to perform ridge regression in the leaf nodes. Experimental results show that the new RF scheme can greatly improve the quality of super-resolved images, by using this augmented feature. Another explanation for this is that the regression problems can benefit more from higher dimensional features than classification problems.  In the new scheme, we unify the research of LSH-based SISR and image retrieval (CBIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p><p>In brief, the new achievement on unsupervised LSH can be evaluated not only in CBIR systems, but also in the clustering-regression RF-based SISR methods. Moreover, as evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, proper unsupervised LSH models, e.g., iterative quantization (ITQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> used for feature dimension reduction instead of PCA, can reduce the damage on the image structure. This can further improve the superresolved image quality. Different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> using an ITQ-like algorithm to rotate the original features into a new feature space, with the use of the proposed original-compressed coupled feature sets, any unsupervised LSH generated features can directly be employed.</p></div>

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the local geometry prior of the data sub-space is used. However, all the weighted ridge regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> are constructed based on an existing dictionary, e.g., Zeyde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> used K-SVD to train a sparse-coding-based dictionary with 1024 items.

A solution to mentioned problem is inspired from the work on image classification using locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, where Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to describe the locality-constrained affine subspace coding (LASC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>We employ GMM to construct the data distribution in the sub-space for each leaf node, which derives the weights of all the entries in the ridge regression models.

Note that when the number of samples in a leaf node becomes bigger, the performance of the GWRR model will achieve less advantage than the normal regression model, because the higher weights will be averaged by a large number of other samples. Theoretically, the regression of a leaf node can benefit from the GWRR model, particularly when there are a few samples falling into the leaf node.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper presents a feature-augmented random forest (FARF) scheme for the single image superresolution (SISR) task by augmenting features and redesigning the inner structure of a random forest (RF), with different feature recipes at different stages, where the compressed features are used for clustering in the split nodes and the original features are used for regression in the leaf nodes. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) the more discriminative gradient magnitude-based augmented features are proposed for clustering on split nodes and regression on leaf nodes; (2) By extending principal component analysis (PCA) to a generalized unsupervised locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) model for dimensionality reduction, we lay out an original compressed coupled feature set for tackling the clustering-regression tasks, which unify SISR and content-based image retrieval (CBIR) for LSH evaluation; and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> we have extended WCR model to a generalized GWRR model for ridge regression. The proposed FAFR scheme can achieve highly competitive quality results, e.g., obtaining about a 0.3dB gain in PSNR, on average, when compared to conventional RF-based super-resolution approaches. Furthermore, a fine-tuned version of our proposed FARF approach is provided, whose performance is comparable to recent state-of-the-art deep-learning-based algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An overview of the proposed FARF framework for image super-resolution.</figDesc></figure>

FARF* is a further refined version of FARF, by performing further fine-tuning: (1) using the superior, unsupervised LSH projection, instead of PCA for dimensionality reduction, (2) employing IBP, instead of the traditional bicubic interpolation algorithm, to obtain the initial coarse estimation in the inference stage, (3) setting the proper number of trees (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45)</ref> for training an RF.Table-2: Results of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art works on 3 datasets in terms of PSNR (dB) using three different magnification factors (#) (×2, ×3, ×4).</figDesc><table><row><cell>dataset</cell><cell>#</cell><cell>bicubic</cell><cell>A+</cell><cell>RF</cell><cell>ARF</cell><cell>RF +</cell><cell>RF #</cell><cell>FARF -</cell><cell>FARF</cell><cell>FARF*</cell><cell>SRCNN</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×2</cell><cell>33.66</cell><cell>36.55</cell><cell>36.52</cell><cell>36.65</cell><cell>36.67</cell><cell>36.63</cell><cell>36.68</cell><cell>36.78</cell><cell>36.81</cell><cell>36.66</cell></row><row><cell>Set5</cell><cell>×3</cell><cell>30.39</cell><cell>32.59</cell><cell>32.44</cell><cell>32.53</cell><cell>32.56</cell><cell>32.53</cell><cell>32.62</cell><cell>32.73</cell><cell>32.78</cell><cell>32.75</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×4</cell><cell>28.42</cell><cell>30.29</cell><cell>30.10</cell><cell>30.17</cell><cell>30.18</cell><cell>30.22</cell><cell>30.27</cell><cell>30.39</cell><cell>30.45</cell><cell>30.48</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×2</cell><cell>30.23</cell><cell>32.28</cell><cell>32.26</cell><cell>32.33</cell><cell>32.37</cell><cell>32.32</cell><cell>32.37</cell><cell>32.41</cell><cell>32.45</cell><cell>32.42</cell></row><row><cell>Set14</cell><cell>×3</cell><cell>27.54</cell><cell>29.13</cell><cell>29.04</cell><cell>29.10</cell><cell>29.17</cell><cell>29.11</cell><cell>29.17</cell><cell>29.23</cell><cell>29.29</cell><cell>29.28</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×4</cell><cell>26.00</cell><cell>27.33</cell><cell>27.22</cell><cell>27.28</cell><cell>27.31</cell><cell>27.29</cell><cell>27.36</cell><cell>27.45</cell><cell>27.48</cell><cell>27.49</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×2</cell><cell>29.32</cell><cell>30.78</cell><cell>31.13</cell><cell>31.21</cell><cell>31.22</cell><cell>31.23</cell><cell>31.34</cell><cell>31.35</cell><cell>31.38</cell><cell>31.36</cell></row><row><cell>B100</cell><cell>×3</cell><cell>27.15</cell><cell>28.18</cell><cell>28.21</cell><cell>28.26</cell><cell>28.27</cell><cell>28.26</cell><cell>28.30</cell><cell>28.35</cell><cell>28.38</cell><cell>28.41</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>×4</cell><cell>25.92</cell><cell>26.77</cell><cell>26.74</cell><cell>26.77</cell><cell>26.78</cell><cell>26.79</cell><cell>26.83</cell><cell>26.88</cell><cell>26.91</cell><cell>26.90</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
