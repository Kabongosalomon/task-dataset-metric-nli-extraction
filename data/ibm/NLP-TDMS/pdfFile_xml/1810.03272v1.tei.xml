<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The number of empirical successes of deep learning keeps steadily increasing, and new technological and architectural breakthroughs become available practically every month. In particular, deep learning has become the default choice in most areas of computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, audio processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. Nevertheless, these breakthroughs often come at a price of expensive computational requirements, which hinders their direct applicability in tasks requiring real-time processing. The good part of this story is that it has been empirically shown by multiple researchers that oftentimes there are lots of redundant operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, and this redundancy can be (and should be) exploited in order to gain speed benefits while keeping performance mostly intact. The bad part of the story is that there are not (yet) general approaches on how to exploit such redundancies in most cases. For example, such methods as knowledge distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> and pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> require us to have an access to an already pre-trained large model in order to train a smaller model of the same (or near) performance. Obviously, there might be times when this is not feasible. In contrast, designing a novel architecture for a specific scenario of high-resolution inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref> limits c 2018. The copyright of this document resides with its authors. It may be distributed unchanged freely in print or electronic forms. arXiv:1810.03272v1 [cs.CV] 8 Oct 2018 the applicability of the same architecture on datasets with drastically different properties and often requires expensive training from scratch.</p><p>Here we are restricting ourselves to the task of semantic segmentation, which has proven to be pivotal on the way of solving scene understanding, and has been successfully exploited in multiple real-world applications, such as medical image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, road scene understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>, aerial segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. These applications tend to rely on realtime processing with high-resolution inputs, which is the Achilles' heel of most modern semantic segmentation networks.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned observations we aim to tackle the task of real-time semantic segmentation in a different way. In particular, we build our approach upon Re-fineNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, a powerful semantic segmentation architecture that can be seamlessly used with any backbone network, such as ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, DenseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, NASNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, or any other. This architecture belongs to the family of the 'encoder-decoder' segmentation networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, where the input image is first progressively downsampled, and later progressively upsampled in order to recover the original input size. We have chosen this particular architecture as it i) shows the best performance among the 'encoder-decoder' approaches, and ii) does not operate over large feature maps in the last layers as methods exploiting atrous convolution do <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. The processing of large feature maps significantly hinders real-time performance of such architectures as DeepLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and PSPNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> due to the increase in the number of floating point operations. As a weak point, the 'encoder-decoder' approaches tend to have a larger number of parameters due to the decoder part that recovers the high resolution output. In this work, we tackle the real-time performance problem by specifically concentrating on the decoder and empirically showing that both the number of parameters and floating point operations can be drastically reduced without a significant drop in accuracy.</p><p>In particular, i) we outline important engineering ameliorations that save the number of parameters by more than 50% in the original RefineNet; then ii) we pinpoint the redundancy of residual blocks in the architecture and show that the performance stays intact with those blocks being removed. We conduct extensive experiments on three competitive benchmarks for semantic segmentation -PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, NYUDv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and PASCAL Person-Part <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and with five different backbone networks -ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, along with recently released NASNet-Mobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, and MobileNet-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The first three backbones are used for the direct comparison between our approach and the original RefineNet, while the last two are used to showcase that our method is orthogonal to the backbone compression, and that we can further benefit from combining these methods.</p><p>Quantitatively, our fastest ResNet model achieves 55 FPS on inputs of size 512 × 512 on GTX 1080Ti, while having 81.1% mean intersection over union (mean iou) performance on PASCAL VOC, 41.7% mean iou on NYUDv2, and 64.9% mean iou on Person-Part. In contrast, our best performing model with 82.7% mean iou on VOC, 44.4% mean iou on NYUDv2, and 67.6% mean iou on Person-Part, still maintains solid 32 FPS.</p><p>All the models will be made publicly available to facilitate the usage of effective and efficient semantic segmentation in a multitude of applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Semantic segmentation. Early approaches in semantic segmentation relied on handcrafted features, such as HOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and SIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, in combination with plain classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> and hierarchical graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. This lasted until the resurgence of deep learning, and a pivotal work by Long et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, in which the authors converted a deep image classification network into a fully convolutional one, able to operate on inputs of different sizes. Further, this line of work was extended by using dilated convolutions and probabilistic graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Other works concentrated around the encoder-decoder paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, where the image is first progressively downsampled, and then progressively upsampled in order to generate the segmentation mask of the same size as the input. Most recently, Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, proposed RefineNet that extended the encoder-decoder approach by adding residual units inside the skip-connections between encoder and decoder. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> appended a multi-scale pooling layer to improve the information flow between local and global (contextual) information; Fu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> exploited multiple encoder-decoder blocks arranged in an hour glass manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> and achieved competitive results using DenseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The current state-of-the art on the popular benchmark dataset PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> belongs to DeepLab-v3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (86.9% mean intersection-over-union on the test set) and DeepLab-v3+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (89.0%) based on ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Xception <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, correspondingly, where the authors included batch normalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> layers inside the atrous spatial pyramid pooling block (ASPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, made use of a large multi-label dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, and added decoder in the latest version.</p><p>Real-Time Segmentation. Most methods outlined above either suffer from a large number of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, a large number of floating point operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. These issues constitute a significant drawback of exploiting such models in applications requiring real-time processing.</p><p>To alleviate them, there have been several task-specific approaches, e.g., ICNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, where the authors adapt PSPNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> to deal with multiple image scales progressively. They attain the speed of 30 FPS on 1024 × 2048 images, and 67% mean iou on the validation set of CityScapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but it is not clear whether this approach would still acquire solid performance on other datasets with low-resolution inputs. Alternatively, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> propose a cascading approach where in each progressive level of the cascade only a certain portion of pixels is being processed by explicitly setting a hard threshold on intermediate classifier outputs. They demonstrate performance of 14.3 FPS on 512 × 512 input resolution with 78.2% mean iou on PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We also note that several other real-time segmentation networks have been following the encoder-decoder paradigm, but have not been able to acquire decent performance levels. Concretely, SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> achieved 40 FPS on inputs of size 360 × 480 with only 57.0% mean iou on CityScapes, while ENet <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> were able to perform inference of 20 FPS on inputs of size 1920 × 1080 with 58.3% mean iou on CityScapes.</p><p>Real-Time Inference in Other Domains. Multiple task-agnostic solutions have been proposed to speed-up inference in neural networks by compression. Current methods achieve more than 100× compression rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Among them, most popular approaches include quantisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>, pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and knowledge distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>.</p><p>Other notable examples are centered around the idea of low-rank factorisation and decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, where a large layer can be decomposed into smaller ones by exploiting (linear) structure.</p><p>While all the methods above have proven to be effective in achieving significant compression rates, an initial powerful, but large pre-trained model for the task at hand must be acquired first. We further note that these methods can be applicable as a post-processing step on top of our approach, but we leave this direction for later exploration.</p><p>Finally  proposed, and it has empirically been shown that models with a smaller number of parameters are able to attain solid performance. To highlight that our approach is orthogonal to such advances in the design of classification networks, we conduct experiments with two light-weight architectures, namely, NASNet-Mobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, and MobileNet-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and show competitive results with very few parameters and floating point operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Light-Weight RefineNet</head><p>Here we will outline our approach aimed to decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations of the original RefineNet architecture, while keeping the performance levels the same. We start by describing the original setup, and then continue with the explanation and discussion of the changes that we propose to be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">RefineNet Primer</head><p>As mentioned above, the RefineNet architecture belongs to the family of the encoder-decoder approaches. As the encoder backbone, it can re-use most popular classification networks; in particular, the original contribution was showcased using residual networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The approach does not amend an underlying classification network in any way except for omitting last classification layers.</p><p>In the decoder part, RefineNet relies on two types of additional abstractions: residual convolutional unit (RCU) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(b)</ref>) and chained residual pooling (CRP) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(c)</ref>). The first one is a simplification of the original residual block <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> without batch normalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, while the second one is a sequence of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, also arranged in a residual manner. All of these blocks use 3 × 3 convolutions and 5 × 5 pooling with appropriate padding so that the spatial size would stay intact.</p><p>The decoding process starts with the propagation of the last output from the classifier (with the lowest resolution) through two RCU blocks followed by four pooling blocks of CRP and another three RCU blocks before being fed into a fusion block ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(d)</ref>) along with the second to last feature map. Inside the fusion block, each path is convolved with 3×3 convolution and upsampled to the largest resolution among the paths. Two paths are then summed up, and analagoulosly further propagated through several RCU, CRP and fusion blocks until the desired resolution is reached. The final convolutional layer produces the score map.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Replacing 3x3 convolutions</head><p>We start by highlighting that the most expensive parts in terms of both the number of parameters and the number of floating point operations of the original RefineNet stem from the ubiquitous usage of 3 × 3 convolutions. Thus, we focus on replacing them with simpler counterparts without performance drops.</p><p>Intuitively, convolutions with larger kernel sizes aim to increase the receptive field size (and the global context coverage), while 1 × 1 convolutions are merely transforming perpixel features from one space to another locally. We argue that in the case of RefineNet we do not require expensive 3 × 3 convolutions at all, and we are able to show empirically that replacing them with 1 × 1 convolutions does not hurt performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the empirical receptive field size <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> for both cases, and do not find any significant difference (Section 8). In particular, we replace 3 × 3 convolutions within CRP and fusion blocks with 1 × 1 counterpart ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(f-g)</ref>), and we amend RCU into the one with the bottleneck design <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1(e)</ref>). This way, we reduce the number of parameters by more than 2× times, and the number of FLOPs by more than 3× times <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, we might have reverted to recently proposed depthwise separable convolutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that are proven to save lots of parameters without sacrificing performance, but our approach is even simpler as it does not use any 3 × 3 convolutions at all, except for the last classification layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Omitting RCU blocks</head><p>We proceeded with initial experiments and trained the light weight architecture outlined in the previous section using PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We were able to achieve close to the original network performance, and, furthermore, observed that removing RCU blocks did not lead</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>Parameters,M FLOPs,B RefineNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> 118 263 RefineNet-101-LW-WITH-RCU 54 76 RefineNet-101-LW 46 52 to any accuracy deterioration, and, in fact, the weights in RCU blocks almost completely saturated.</p><p>To confirm that this only occurs in the light weight case, we explored dropping RCU blocks in the original RefineNet architecture, and we experienced more than 5% performance drop on the same dataset. We argue that this happens due to the RCU blocks being redundant in the 1 × 1 convolution regime, as the only important goal of increasing the contextual coverage is essentially performed by pooling layers inside CRP. To back up this claim, we conduct a series of ablation experiments which are covered later in Section 5.2.</p><p>Our final architecture does not contain any RCU blocks and only relies on CRP blocks with 1 × 1 convolutions and 5 × 5 max-pooling inside, which makes our method extremely fast and light-weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Adaptation to different backbones</head><p>A significant practical benefit of the RefineNet architecture is that it can be mixed with any backbone network as long as the backbone has several subsampling operations inside (which is the case for most SOTA classifiers). Thus, there are no specific changes needed to be made in order to apply the RefineNet architecture using any other model. In particular, in the experiments section, we showcase its adaptation using efficient NASNet-Mobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> and MobileNet-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> networks; we still achieve solid performance with the limited number of parameters and floating point operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In the experimental part, our aims are to prove empirically that we are able i) to achieve similar performance levels with the original RefineNet while ii) significantly reducing the number of parameters and iii) drastically increasing the speed of a forward pass; and iv) to highlight the possibility of applying our method using other architectures.</p><p>To this end, we consider three segmentation datasets, namely, NYUDv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and PASCAL Person-Part dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and five classification networks, i.e., ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, NASNet-Mobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> and MobileNet-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> (only for Pascal VOC), all of which have been pre-trained on ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. As a general practice, we report mean intersection over union <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> on each benchmark. Additional results on PASCAL Context <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and CityScapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are given in the supplementary material.</p><p>We perform all our experiments in PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. For all residual networks we start with the initial learning rate of 5e-4, for NASNet-mobile and MobileNet-v2 we start with the learning rate of 1e-3. We keep batch norm statistics frozen during the training.</p></div>

For benchmarking, we use a workstation with 8GB RAM, Intel i5-7600 processor, and one GT1080Ti GPU card under CUDA 9.0 and CuDNN 7.0. For fair comparison of runtime, we re-implement original RefineNet in PyTorch. We compute 100 forward passes with random inputs, and average the results; when reporting, we provide both the mean and standard deviation values.</p><p>NYUDv2. We first conduct a series of initial experiments on NYUDv2 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. This dataset comprises 1449 RGB-D images with 40 segmented class labels, of which 795 are used for training and 654 for testing, respectively. We do not make use of depth information in any way.

We note that for all ResNet networks we are able to closely match the performance of the original RefineNet, while having only a slight portion of the original parameters. This further leads to a significant twofold speedup.</p><p>Person-Part. PASCAL Person-Part dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> consists of 1716 training and 1817 validation images with 6 semantic classes, including head, torso, and upper/lower legs/arms, plus background. We follow the same training strategy as for NYUDv2, and provide our results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. Again, we achieve analagous to the original models results.</p><p>PASCAL VOC. We continue our experiments with a standard benchmark dataset for semantic segmentation, PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This dataset consists of 4369 images with 20 semantic classes plus background, of which 1464 constitute the training set, 1449 -validation, and 1456 -test, respectively. As commonly done, we augment it with additionally annotated VOC images from BSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, as well as images from MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>We train all the networks using the same strategy, but with different learning rates as outlined above: in particular, we reduce the learning rate by half after 20 epochs of COCO training and after 50 epochs of the BSD training, and keep training until 200 total epochs, or until the accuracy on the validation set stops improving.</p><p>Our quantitative results on validation and test sets are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> along with the results from the original RefineNet. We again notice that for all ResNet networks, we achieve performance on-par with the original RefineNet; for NASNet-Mobile and MobileNet-v2, we   outperform both MobileNet-v1+DeepLab-v3 and MobileNet-v2+DeepLab-v3 approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, which are closely related to our method. Qualitative results are provided on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>As noted above, we are able to achieve similar results by omitting more than half of the original parameters. This raises the question on how and why this does happen. We conduct a series of experiments aimed to provide some insights into this matter. More details are provided in the supplementary material.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Receptive field size</head><p>First, we consider the issue of the receptive field size. Intuitively, dropping 3×3 convolutions should significantly harm the receptive field size of the original architecture. Nevertheless, we note that we do not experience this due to i) the skip-design structure of RefineNet, where low-level features are being summed up with the high-level ones, and ii) keeping CRP blocks that are responsible for gathering contextual information.</p><p>In particular, we explore the empirical receptive field (ERF) size <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> in Light-Weight RefineNet-101 pre-trained on PASCAL VOC. Before CRP ERF is concentrated around small object parts, and barely covers the objects <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The CRP block tends to enlarge ERF, while the summation with the lower layer features further produces significantly larger activation contours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Representational power</head><p>Even though the RCU block seems not to influence the receptive field size of the network, it might still be responsible for producing important features for both segmentation and classification.</p><p>To evaluate whether it is the case indeed, we conduct ablation experiments by adding multi-label classification and segmentation heads in the lowest resolution block of RefineNet-101 pre-trained on PASCAL VOC 1) before RCU, 2) after RCU, and 3) after CRP. We fix the rest of the trained network and fine-tune only these heads separately using 1464 training images of the VOC dataset. We evaluate all the results on the validation subset of VOC.</p><p>As seen from  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we tackled the problem of rethinking an existing semantic segmentation architecture into the one suitable for real-time performance, while keeping the performance levels mostly intact. We achieved that by proposing simple modifications to the existing network and highlighting which building blocks were redundant for the final result. Our method can be applied along with any classification network for any dataset and can further benefit from using light-weight backbone networks, and other compression approaches. Quantitatively, we were able to closely match the performance of the original network while significantly surpassing its runtime and even acquiring 55 FPS on 512 × 512 inputs (from initial 20 FPS).</p><p>Besides that, we demonstrate that having convolutions with large kernel sizes can be unnecessary in the decoder part of segmentation networks, and we will devote future work to further cover this topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Material 7 Experiments</head><p>In addition to the experiments outlined in the main section, we evaluate our approach on PASCAL Context <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and CityScapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>PASCAL-Context. This dataset comprises 60 semantic labels (including background), and consists of 4998 training images, and 5105 validation images. During training, we divide the learning rate by half twice after 50 epochs and after 100 epochs, respectively, and keep training until 200 epochs, or earlier convergence. We do not pre-train on PASCAL VOC or COCO.</p><p>Our quantitative results are provided in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> and qualitative results are on <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>CityScapes. Finally, we turn our attention to the CityScapes dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, that contains 5000 high-resolution (1024 × 2048) images with 19 semantic classes, of which 2975 images are used for training, 500 for validation, and 1525 for testing, respectively. We use the same learning strategy as for Context. Our single-scale model with ResNet-101 as backbone, is able to achieve 72.1% mean iou on the test set, which is close to the original RefineNet result of 73.6% with multi-scale evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Visual results are presented on <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Receptive field size</head><p>To quantify why dropping 3 × 3 convolutions does not result in significant performance drop, we consider the issue of the empirical receptive field (ERF) size <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Intuitively, dropping 3 × 3 convolutions should significantly harm the receptive field size of the original architecture. Nevertheless, we note that we do not experience this due to i) the skip-design structure of RefineNet, where low-level features are being summed up with the high-level ones, and ii) keeping CRP blocks. Additionally to the results in the main text, we compare ERF of the last (classification) layer between original RefineNet-101 and RefineNet-LW-101, both been pre-trained on PASCAL VOC. From <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, it can be noticed that both networks exhibit semantically similar activation contours, although the original architecture tends to produce less jagged boundaries.</p></div>
