<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or stateof-the-art accuracy at moderate computational costs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Entity disambiguation (ED) is an important stage in text understanding which automatically resolves references to entities in a given knowledge base (KB). This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity between surface form mentions such as names and the entities they refer to. This many-to-many ambiguity can often be captured partially by name-entity co-occurrence counts extracted from entity-linked corpora.</p><p>ED research has largely focused on two types of contextual information for disambiguation: local information based on words that occur in a context window around an entity mention, and, global information, exploiting document-level coherence of the referenced entities. Many stateof-the-art methods aim to combine the benefits of both, which is also the philosophy we follow in this paper. What is specific to our approach is that we use embeddings of entities as a common representation to assess local as well as global evidence.</p><p>In recent years, many text and language understanding tasks have been advanced by neural network architectures. However, despite recent work, competitive ED systems still largely employ manually designed features. Such features often rely on domain knowledge and may fail to capture all relevant statistical dependencies and interactions. The explicit goal of our work is to use deep learning in order to learn basic features and their combinations from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to carry out this program with full rigor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Contributions and Related Work</head><p>There is a vast prior research on entity disambiguation, highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ji, 2016)</ref>. We will focus here on a discussion of our main contributions in relation to prior work. Entity Embeddings. We have developed a simple, yet effective method to embed entities and words in a common vector space. This follows the popular line of work on word embeddings, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, which was recently extended to entities and ED by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamada et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zwicklbauer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huang et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast to the above methods that require data about entity-entity co-occurrences which often suffers from sparsity, we rather bootstrap entity embeddings from their canonical entity pages and local context of their hyperlink annotations. This allows for more efficient training and alleviates the need to compile co-linking statistics. These vector representations are a key component to avoid hand-engineered features, multiple disambiguation steps, or the need for additional ad hoc heuristics when solving the ED task. Context Attention. We present a novel attention mechanism for local ED. Inspired by mem-ory networks of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sukhbaatar et al., 2015)</ref> and insights of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lazic et al., 2015)</ref>, our model deploys attention to select words that are informative for the disambiguation decision. A learned combination of the resulting context-based entity scores and a mention-entity prior yields the final local scores. Our local model achieves better accuracy than the local probabilistic model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ganea et al., 2016)</ref>, as well as the feature-engineered local model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Globerson et al., 2016)</ref>. As an added benefit, our model has a smaller memory footprint and it's very fast for both training and testing.</p><p>There have been other deep learning approaches to define local context models for ED. For instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Francis-Landau et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">He et al., 2013)</ref> use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and stacked denoising auto-encoders, respectively, to learn representations of textual documents and canonical entity pages. Entities for each mention are locally scored based on cosine similarity with the respective document embedding. In a similar local setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sun et al., 2015)</ref> embed mentions, their immediate contexts and their candidate entities using word embeddings and CNNs. However, their entity representations are restrictively built from entity titles and entity categories only. Unfortunately, the above models are rather 'blackbox' (as opposed to ours which reveals the attention focus) and were never extended to perform joint document disambiguation.</p><p>Collective Disambiguation. Last, a novel deep learning architecture for global ED is proposed. Mentions in a document are resolved jointly, using a conditional random field <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lafferty et al., 2001)</ref> with parametrized potentials. We suggest to learn the latter by casting loopy belief propagation (LBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Murphy et al., 1999)</ref> as a rolled-out deep network. This is inspired by similar approaches in computer vision, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Domke, 2013)</ref>, and allows us to backpropagate through the (truncated) message passing, thereby optimizing the CRF potentials to work well in conjunction with the inference scheme. Our model is thus trained end-to-end with the exception of the pre-trained word and entity embeddings. Previous work has investigated different approximation techniques, including: random graph walks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Guo and Barbosa, 2016)</ref>, personalized PageRank <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pershina et al., 2015)</ref>, intermention voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010)</ref>, graph pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hoffart et al., 2011)</ref>, integer linear programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cheng and Roth, 2013)</ref>, or ranking SVMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ratinov et al., 2011)</ref>. Mostly connected to our approach is <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ganea et al., 2016)</ref> where LBP is used for inference (but not learning) in a probabilistic graphical model and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Globerson et al., 2016)</ref> where a single round of message passing with attention is performed. To our knowledge, we are one of the first to investigate differentiable message passing for NLP problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Learning Entity Embeddings</head><p>In a first step, we propose to train entity vectors that can be used for the ED task (and potentially for other tasks). These embeddings compress the semantic meaning of entities and drastically reduce the need for manually designed features or co-occurrence statistics.</p><p>Entity embeddings are bootstrapped from word embeddings and are trained independently for each entity. A few arguments motivate this decision: (i) there is no need for entity co-occurrence statistics that suffer from sparsity issues and/or large memory footprints; (ii) vectors of entities in a subset domain of interest can be trained separately, obtaining potentially significant speed-ups and memory savings that would otherwise be prohibitive for large entity KBs; 1 (iii) entities can be easily added in an incremental manner, which is important in practice; (iv) the approach extends well into the tail of rare entities with few linked occurrences; (v) empirically, we achieve better quality compared to methods that use entity cooccurrence statistics.</p><p>Our model embeds words and entities in the same low-dimensional vector space in order to exploit geometric similarity between them. We start with a pre-trained word embedding map x : W → R d that is known to encode semantic meaning of words w ∈ W; specifically we use word2vec pretrained vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. We extend this map to entities E, i.e. x : E → R d , as described below.</p><p>We assume a generative model in which words that co-occur with an entity e are sampled from a conditional distribution p(w|e) when they are generated. Empirically, we collect word-entity cooccurrence counts #(w, e) from two sources: (i) the canonical KB description page of the entity (e.g. entity's Wikipedia page in our case), and (ii) the windows of fixed size surrounding mentions of the entity in an annotated corpus (e.g. Wikipedia hyperlinks in our case). These counts define a practical approximation of the above word-entity conditional distribution, i.e.p(w|e) ∝ #(w, e). We call this the "positive" distribution of words related to the entity. Next, let q(w) be a generic word probability distribution which we use for sampling "negative" words unrelated to a specific entity. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, we choose a smoothed unigram distribution q(w) =p(w) α for some α ∈ (0, 1). The desired outcome is that vectors of positive words are closer (in terms of dot product) to the embedding of entity e compared to vectors of random words. Let w + ∼p(w|e) and w − ∼ q(w). Then, we use a max-margin objective to infer the optimal embedding for entity e:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J(z; e) := E w + |e E w − h z; w + , w − h(z; w, v) := [γ − z, x w − x v ] + (1) x e := arg min z: z =1 J(z; e)</formula><p>where γ &gt; 0 is a margin parameter and [·] + is the ReLU function. The above loss is optimized using stochastic gradient descent with projection over sampled pairs (w + , w − ). Note that the entity vector is directly optimized on the unit sphere which is important in order to obtain qualitative embeddings.</p><p>We empirically assess the quality of our entity embeddings on entity similarity and ED tasks as detailed in Section 7 and Appendix A. The technique described in this section can also be applied, in principle, for computing embeddings of general text documents, but a comparison with such methods is left as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Local Model with Neural Attention</head><p>We now explain our local ED approach that uses word and entity embeddings to steer a neural attention mechanism. We build on the insight that only a few context words are informative for resolving an ambiguous mention, something that has been exploited before in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lazic et al., 2015)</ref>. Focusing only on those words helps reducing noise and improves disambiguation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamada et al., 2016)</ref> observe the same problem and adopt the restrictive strategy of removing all non-nouns. Here, we assume that a context word may be relevant, if it is strongly related to at least one of the entity candidates of a given mention. Context Scores.</p><p>Let us assume that we have computed a mention-entity priorp(e|m) (procedure detailed in Section 6). In addition, for each mention m, a pruned candidate set Γ(m) of at most S entities has been identified. Our model, depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, computes a score for each e ∈ Γ(m) based on the K-word local context c = {w 1 , . . . , w K } surrounding m, as well as on the prior. It is a composition of differentiable functions, thus it is smooth from input to output, allowing us to easily compute gradients and backpropagate through it.</p><p>Each word w ∈ c and entity e ∈ Γ(m) is mapped to its embedding via the pre-trained map x (cf. Section 3). We then compute an unnormalized support score for each word in the context as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u(w) = max e∈Γ(m) x e Ax w<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where A is a parameterized diagonal matrix. The weight is high if the word is strongly related to at least one candidate entity. We often observe that uninformative words (e.g. similar to stop words) receive non-negligible scores which add undesired noise to our local context model. As a consequence, we (hard) prune to the top R ≤ K words with the highest scores 2 and apply a softmax function on these weights. Define the reduced context:c</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= {w ∈ c|u(w) ∈ topR(u)}<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Then, the final attention weights are explicitly</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β(w) = exp[u(w)] v∈c exp[u(v)] . if w ∈c 0 otherwise.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Finally, we define a β-weighted context-based entity-mention score via</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ψ(e, c) = w∈c β(w) x e B x w<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where B is another trainable diagonal matrix. We will later use the same architecture for the unary scores of our global ED model. Local Score Combination.</p><p>We integrate these context scores with the context-independent scores encoded inp(e|m). </p><p>We find a flexible choice for f to be important and superior to a naïve weighted average combination model. We therefore use a neural network with two fully connected layers of 100 hidden units and ReLU non-linearities, which we regularize as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Denton et al., 2015)</ref> by constraining the sum of squares of all weights in the linear layer. We use standard projected SGD for training. The same network is also used in Section 5.</p><p>Prediction is done independently for each mention m i and context c i by maximizing the Ψ(e, m i , c i ) score.</p><p>Learning the Local Model.</p><p>Entity and word embeddings are pre-trained as discussed in Section 3. Thus, the only learnable parameters are the diagonal matrices A and B, plus the parameters of f . Having few parameters helps to avoid overfitting and to be able to train with little annotated data. We assume that a set of known mention-entity pairs {(m, e * )} with their respective context windows have been extracted from a corpus. For model fitting, we then utilize a max-margin loss that ranks ground truth entities higher than other candidate entities. This leads us to the objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">θ * = arg min θ D∈D m∈D e∈Γ(m) g(e, m),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>g(e, m) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= [γ − Ψ(e * , m, c) + Ψ(e, m, c)] +</formula><p>where γ &gt; 0 is a margin parameter and D is a training set of entity annotated documents. We aim to find a Ψ (i.e. parameterized by θ) such that the score of the correct entity e * referenced by m is at least a margin γ higher than that of any other candidate entity e. Whenever this is not the case, the margin violation becomes the experienced loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Document-Level Deep Model</head><p>Next, we address global ED assuming document coherence among entities. We therefore introduce the notion of a document as consisting of a set of mentions m = m 1 , . . . , m n , along with their context windows c = c 1 , . . . c n . Our goal is to define a joint probability distribution over</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Γ(m 1 ) × . . . × Γ(m n ) e.</formula><p>Each such e selects one candidate entity for each mention in the document. Obviously, the state space of e grows exponentially in the number of mentions n. CRF Model.</p><p>Our model is a fully-connected pairwise conditional random field, defined on the log scale as </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">g(e, m, c) = n i=1 Ψ i (e i ) + i&lt;j Φ(e i ,<label>e</label></formula><p>where C is a diagonal matrix. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ganea et al., 2016)</ref>, the above normalization helps balancing the unary and pairwise terms across documents with different numbers of mentions.</p><p>The function value g(e, m, c) is supposedly high for semantically related sets of entities that also have local support. The goal of a global ED prediction method is to perform maximum-aposteriori on this CRF to find the set of entities e that maximize g(e, m, c). Differentiable Inference.</p><p>Training and prediction in binary CRF models as the one above is NP-hard. Therefore, in learning one usually maximizes a likelihood approximation and during operations (i.e. in prediction) one may use an approximate inference procedure, often based on message-passing. Among many challenges of these approaches, it is worth pointing out that weaknesses of the approximate inference procedure are generally not captured during learning. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Domke, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Domke, , 2013</ref>, we use truncated fitting of loopy belief propagation (LBP) to a fixed number of message passing iterations. Our model directly optimizes the marginal likelihoods, using the same networks for learning and prediction. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Domke, 2013)</ref>, this method is robust to model mis-specification, avoids inherent difficulties of partition functions and is faster compared to double-loop likelihood training (where, for each stochastic update, inference is run until convergence is achieved).</p><p>Our architecture is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. A neural network with T layers encodes T message passing iterations of synchronous max-product LBP 3 which is designed to find the most likely (MAP) entity assignments that maximize g(e, m, c). We also use message damping, which is known to speed-up and stabilize convergence of message passing. Formally, in iteration t, mention m i votes for entity candidate e ∈ Γ(m j ) of mention m j using the normalized log-message m t i→j (e) computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">m t+1 i→j (e) = max e ∈Γ(m i ) Ψ i (e ) + Φ(e, e ) + k =j m t k→i (e )} .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Herein the first part just reflects the CRF potentials, whereas the second part is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m t i→j (e) = log[δ · softmax(m t i→j (e))<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">+ (1 − δ) · exp(m t−1 i→j (e))]</formula><p>where δ ∈ (0, 1] is a damping factor. Note that, without loss of generality, we simplify the LBP procedure by dropping the factor nodes. The messages at first iteration (layer) are set to zero. After T iterations (network layers), the beliefs (marginals) are computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">µ i (e) = Ψ i (e) + k =i m T k→i (e)<label>(12)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">µ i (e) = exp[µ i (e)] e ∈Γ(m i ) exp[µ i (e )]<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Similar to the local case, we obtain accuracy improvement when combining the mention-entity priorp(e|m) with marginal µ i (e) using the same non-linear combination function f from Equation 6 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ρ i (e) := f (µ i (e), logp(e|m i ))<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The learned function f for global ED is nontrivial (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3)</ref>, showing that the influence of the prior tends to weaken for larger µ(e), whereas it has a dominating influence whenever the document-level evidence is weak. We also experimented with the prior integrated directly inside the unary factors Ψ i (e i ), but results were worse because, in some cases, the global entity interaction is not able to recover from strong incorrect priors (e.g. country names have a strong prior towards the respective countries as opposed to national sports teams).</p><p>Parameters of our global model are the diagonal matrices A, B, C and the weights of the f network. As before, we find a margin based objective to be the most effective and we suggest to fit parameters by minimizing a ranking loss 4 defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L(θ) = D∈D m i ∈D e∈Γ(m i ) h(m i , e) (15) h(m i , e) = [γ − ρ i (e * i ) + ρ i (e)] +<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Computing this objective is trivial by running T times the steps described by Eqs. (10), (11), followed in the end by the step in Eq. (13). Each step is differentiable and the gradient of the model parameters can be computed on the resulting marginals and back-propagated over messages using chain rule. At test time, marginals ρ i (e) are computed jointly per document using this network, but prediction is done independently for each mention m i by maximizing its respective marginal score.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Training Details and (Hyper)Parameters</head><p>We explain training details of our approach. All models are implemented in the Torch framework. Entity Vectors Training &amp; Relatedness Evaluation. For entity embeddings only, we use  Wikipedia (Feb 2014) corpus for training. Entity vectors are initialized randomly from a 0mean normal distribution with standard deviation 1. We first train each entity vector on the entity's Wikipedia canonical description page (title words included) for 400 iterations. Subsequently, Wikipedia hyperlinks of the respective entities are used for learning until validation score (described below) stops improving. In each iteration, 20 positive words, each with 5 negative words, are sampled and used for optimization as explained in Section 3. We use Adagrad <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Duchi et al., 2011)</ref> with a learning rate of 0.3. We choose embedding size d = 300, pre-trained (fixed) Word2Vec word vectors 8 , α = 0.6, γ = 0.1 and window size of 20 for the hyperlinks. We remove stop words before training. Since our method allows to train the embedding of each entity independently of other entities, we decide for efficiency reasons (and without loss of generality) to learn only the vectors of all entities appearing as mention candidates in all the test datasets described in Sec. 7.1, a total of 270000 entities. Training of those takes 20 hours on a single TitanX GPU with 12GB of memory. We test and validate our entity embeddings on the entity relatedness dataset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ceccarelli et al., 2013)</ref>. It contains 3319 and 3673 queries for the test and validation sets. Each query consist of one target entity and up to 100 candidate entities with gold standard binary labels indicating if the two entities are related. The associated task requires ranking of related candidate entities higher than the others. Following previous work, we use different evaluation metrics: normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and mean average precision (MAP). The validation score used during learning is then the sum of the four metrics showed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We perform candidate ranking based on cosine similarity of entity pairs. Local and Global Model Training. Our local and global ED models are trained on AIDA-train (multiple epochs), validated on AIDA-A and tested on AIDA-B and other datasets mentioned in Section 7.1. We use Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kingma and Ba, 2014)</ref> with learning rate of 1e-4 until validation accuracy exceeds 90%, afterwards setting it to 1e-5. Variable size mini-batches consisting of all mentions in a document are used during training. We remove stop words. Hyper-parameters of the best validated global model are: γ = 0.01, K = 100, R = 25, S = 7, δ = 0.5, T = 10. For the local model, R = 50 was best. Validation accuracy is computed after each 5 epochs. To regularize, we use early stopping, i.e. we stop learning if the validation accuracy does not increase after 500 epochs. Training on a single GPU takes, on average, 2ms per mention, or 16 hours for 1250 epochs over AIDA-train.</p><p>By using diagonal matrices A, B, C, we keep the number of parameters very low (approx. 1.2K parameters). This is necessary to avoid overfitting when learning from a very small training set. We also experimented with diagonal plus low-rank matrices, but encountered quality degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Entity Similarity Results</head><p>Results for the entity similarity task are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Our method outperforms the well established Wikipedia link measure and the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamada et al., 2016)</ref> using less information (only word -entity statistics). We note that the best result on this dataset was reported in the unpublished work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huang et al., 2015)</ref>. Their entity embeddings are trained on many more sources of information (e.g. KG links, relations, entity types). However, our focus was to prove that lightweight trained embeddings useful for the ED task can also perform decently for the entity sim-  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: ED accuracy on AIDA-B for our best system splitted by Wikipedia hyperlink frequency and mention prior of the ground truth entity, in cases where the gold entity appears in the candidate set.</p><p>ilarity task. We emphasize that our global ED model outperforms Huang's ED model <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>, likely due to the power of our local and joint neural network architectures. For example, our attention mechanism clearly benefits from explicitly embedding words and entities in the same space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">ED Baselines &amp; Results</head><p>We compare with systems that report state-of-theart results on the datasets. Some baseline scores from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Guo and Barbosa, 2016)</ref>. The best results for the AIDA datasets are reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yamada et al., 2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Globerson et al., 2016)</ref>. We do not compare against <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pershina et al., 2015)</ref> since, as noted also by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Globerson et al., 2016)</ref>, their mention index artificially includes the gold entity (guaranteed gold recall), which is not a realistic setting. For a fair comparison with prior work, we use in-KB accuracy and micro F1 (averaged per mention) metrics to evaluate our approach. Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref>. We run our system 5 times, each time we pick the best model on the validation set, and report results on the test set for these models. We obtain state of the art accuracy on AIDA which is the largest and hardest (by the accuracy of thep(e|m) baseline) manually created ED dataset . We are also competitive on the other datasets. It should be noted that all the other methods use, at least partially, engineered features. The merit of our proposed method is to show that, with the exception of thep(e|m) feature, a neural network is able to learn the best features for ED without requiring expert input.</p><p>To gain further insight, we analyzed the accuracy on the AIDA-B dataset for situations where gold entities have low frequency or mention prior. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows that our method performs well in these harder cases.  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Examples of context words selected by our local attention mechanism. Distinct words are sorted decreasingly by attention weights and only words with non-zero weights are shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Hyperparameter Studies</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, we analyze the effect of two hyperparameters. First, we see that hard attention (i.e. R &lt; K) helps reducing the noise from uninformative context words (as opposed to keeping all words when R = K). Second, we see that a small number of LBP iterations (hard-coded in our network) is enough to obtain good accuracy. This speeds up training and testing compared to traditional methods that run LBP until convergence. An explanation is that a truncated version of LBP can perform well enough if used at both training and test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6">Qualitative Analysis of Local Model</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> we show some examples of context words attended by our local model for correctly solved hard cases (where the mention prior of the correct entity is low). One can notice that words relevant for at least one entity candidate are chosen by our model in most of the cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Error Analysis</head><p>We analyse some of the errors made by our model on the AIDA-B dataset. We mostly observe three situations: i) annotation errors, ii) gold entities that do not appear in mentions' candidate sets, or iii) gold entities with very low p(e|m) prior whose mentions have an incorrect entity candidate with high prior. For example, the mention "Italians" refers in some specific context to the entity "Italy national football team" rather than the entity representing the country. The contextual information is not strong enough in this case to avoid an incorrect prediction. On the other hand, there are situations where the context can be misleading, e.g. a document heavily discussing about cricket will favor resolving the mention "Australia" to the entity "Australia national cricket team" instead of the gold entity "Australia" (naming a location of cricket games in the given context).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed a novel deep learning architecture for entity disambiguation that combines entity embeddings, a contextual attention mechanism, an adaptive local score combination, as well as unrolled differentiable message passing for global inference. Compared to many other methods, we do not rely on hand-engineered features, nor on an extensive corpus for entity co-occurrences or relatedness. Our system is fully differentiable, although we chose to pre-train word and entity embeddings. Extensive experiments show the competitiveness of our approach across a wide range of corpora. In the future, we would like to extend this system to perform nil detection, coreference resolution and mention detection.</p><p>Our code and data are publicly available: http://github.com/dalab/deep-ed</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Local model with neural attention.
