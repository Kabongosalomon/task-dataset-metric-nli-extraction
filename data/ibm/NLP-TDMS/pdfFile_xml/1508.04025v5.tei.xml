<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) achieved state-of-the-art performances in large-scale translation tasks such as from English to French <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Luong et al., 2015)</ref> and English to German <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Jean et al., 2015)</ref>. NMT is appealing since it requires minimal domain knowledge and is conceptually simple. The model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luong et al. (2015)</ref> reads through all the source words until the end-ofsentence symbol &lt;eos&gt; is reached. It then starts <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Neural machine translation -a stacking recurrent architecture for translating a source sequence A B C D into a target sequence X Y Z. Here, &lt;eos&gt; marks the end of a sentence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">B C D &lt;eos&gt; X Y Z X Y Z &lt;eos&gt; A</formula><p>emitting one target word at a time, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. NMT is often a large neural network that is trained in an end-to-end fashion and has the ability to generalize well to very long word sequences. This means the model does not have to explicitly store gigantic phrase tables and language models as in the case of standard MT; hence, NMT has a small memory footprint. Lastly, implementing NMT decoders is easy unlike the highly intricate decoders in standard MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Koehn et al., 2003)</ref>. In parallel, the concept of "attention" has gained popularity recently in training neural networks, allowing models to learn alignments between different modalities, e.g., between image objects and agent actions in the dynamic control problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Mnih et al., 2014)</ref>, between speech frames and text in the speech recognition task (?), or between visual features of a picture and its text description in the image caption generation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. In the context of <ref type="bibr">NMT, Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref> has successfully applied such attentional mechanism to jointly translate and align words. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any other work exploring the use of attention-based architectures for NMT.</p><p>In this work, we design, with simplicity and ef-fectiveness in mind, two novel types of attentionbased models: a global approach in which all source words are attended and a local one whereby only a subset of source words are considered at a time. The former approach resembles the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref> but is simpler architecturally. The latter can be viewed as an interesting blend between the hard and soft attention models proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Xu et al., 2015)</ref>: it is computationally less expensive than the global model or the soft attention; at the same time, unlike the hard attention, the local attention is differentiable almost everywhere, making it easier to implement and train. 2 Besides, we also examine various alignment functions for our attention-based models. Experimentally, we demonstrate that both of our approaches are effective in the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. Our attentional models yield a boost of up to 5.0 BLEU over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. For English to German translation, we achieve new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for both WMT'14 and WMT'15, outperforming previous SOTA systems, backed by NMT models and n-gram LM rerankers, by more than 1.0 BLEU. We conduct extensive analysis to evaluate our models in terms of learning, the ability to handle long sentences, choices of attentional architectures, alignment quality, and translation outputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Neural Machine Translation</head><p>A neural machine translation system is a neural network that directly models the conditional probability p(y|x) of translating a source sentence, x 1 , . . . , x n , to a target sentence, y 1 , . . . , y m . 3 A basic form of NMT consists of two components: (a) an encoder which computes a representation s for each source sentence and (b) a decoder which generates one target word at a time and hence decomposes the conditional probability as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log p(y|x) = m j=1</formula><p>log p (y j |y &lt;j , s) (1)</p><p>A natural choice to model such a decomposition in the decoder is to use a 2 There is a recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gregor et al. (2015)</ref>, which is very similar to our local attention and applied to the image generation task. However, as we detail later, our model is much simpler and can achieve good performance for NMT.</p><p>3 All sentences are assumed to terminate with a special "end-of-sentence" token &lt;eos&gt;. recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which most of the recent NMT work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cho et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jean et al., 2015)</ref> have in common. They, however, differ in terms of which RNN architectures are used for the decoder and how the encoder computes the source sentence representation s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013)</ref> used an RNN with the standard hidden unit for the decoder and a convolutional neural network for encoding the source sentence representation. On the other hand, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sutskever et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luong et al. (2015)</ref> stacked multiple layers of an RNN with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden unit for both the encoder and the decoder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cho et al.

Such an approach is referred to as an attention mechanism, which we will discuss next.</p><p>In this work, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Luong et al., 2015)</ref>, we use the stacking LSTM architecture for our NMT systems, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We use the LSTM unit defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Zaremba et al., 2015)</ref>. Our training objective is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">J t = (x,y)∈D − log p(y|x)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with D being our parallel training corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Attention-based Models</head><p>Our various attention-based models are classifed into two broad categories, global and local. These classes differ in terms of whether the "attention" is placed on all source positions or on only a few source positions. We illustrate these two model types in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and 3 respectively. Common to these two types of models is the fact that at each time step t in the decoding phase, both approaches first take as input the hidden state h t at the top layer of a stacking LSTM. The goal is then to derive a context vector c t that captures relevant source-side information to help predict the current target word y t . While these models differ in how the context vector c t is derived, they share the same subsequent steps.</p><p>Specifically, given the target hidden state h t and the source-side context vector c t , we employ a simple concatenation layer to combine the information from both vectors to produce an attentional hidden state as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h t = tanh(W c [c t ; h t ])<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The attentional vectorh t is then fed through the softmax layer to produce the predictive distribution formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p(y t |y &lt;t , x) = softmax(W sht )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>We now detail how each model type computes the source-side context vector c t .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Global Attention</head><p>The idea of a global attentional model is to consider all the hidden states of the encoder when deriving the context vector c t . In this model type, a variable-length alignment vector a t , whose size equals the number of time steps on the source side, is derived by comparing the current target hidden state h t with each source hidden stateh s : a t (s) = align(h t ,h s )</p><p>= exp score(h t ,h s )</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s ′ exp score(h t ,h s ′ ) y th t c t a t h t h s</formula></div>

A global context vector c t is then computed as the weighted average, according to a t , over all the source states.</p><p>Here, score is referred as a content-based function for which we consider three different alternatives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">score(h t ,h s ) =      h ⊤ th s dot h ⊤ t W ahs general v ⊤ a tanh W a [h t ;h s ] concat</formula><p>Besides, in our early attempts to build attentionbased models, we use a location-based function in which the alignment scores are computed from solely the target hidden state h t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a t = softmax(W a h t )</formula><p>location <ref type="formula">(8)</ref> Given the alignment vector as weights, the context vector c t is computed as the weighted average over all the source hidden states. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref> -While our global attention approach is similar in spirit to the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref>, there are several key differences which reflect how we have both simplified and generalized from the original model. First, we simply use hidden states at the top LSTM layers in both the encoder and decoder as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref>, on the other hand, use the concatenation of the forward and backward source hidden states in the bi-directional encoder</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y th t c t a t h t p t h s</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Layer</head><p>Context vector Local weights Aligned position <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Local attention model -the model first predicts a single aligned position p t for the current target word. A window centered around the source position p t is then used to compute a context vector c t , a weighted average of the source hidden states in the window. The weights a t are inferred from the current target state h t and those source statesh s in the window. and target hidden states in their non-stacking unidirectional decoder. Second, our computation path is simpler; we go from h t → a t → c t →h t then make a prediction as detailed in Eq. (5), Eq. (6), and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. On the other hand, at any time t, Bahdanau et al. <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref> build from the previous hidden state h t−1 → a t → c t → h t , which, in turn, goes through a deep-output and a maxout layer before making predictions. 7 Lastly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref> only experimented with one alignment function, the concat product; whereas we show later that the other alternatives are better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Local Attention</head><p>The global attention has a drawback that it has to attend to all words on the source side for each target word, which is expensive and can potentially render it impractical to translate longer sequences, e.g., paragraphs or documents. To address this deficiency, we propose a local attentional mechanism that chooses to focus only on a small subset of the source positions per target word.</p><p>This model takes inspiration from the tradeoff between the soft and hard attentional models proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> to tackle the image caption generation task. In their work, soft attention <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We will refer to this difference again in Section 3.3. refers to the global attention approach in which weights are placed "softly" over all patches in the source image. The hard attention, on the other hand, selects one patch of the image to attend to at a time. While less expensive at inference time, the hard attention model is non-differentiable and requires more complicated techniques such as variance reduction or reinforcement learning to train.</p><p>Our local attention mechanism selectively focuses on a small window of context and is differentiable. This approach has an advantage of avoiding the expensive computation incurred in the soft attention and at the same time, is easier to train than the hard attention approach. In concrete details, the model first generates an aligned position p t for each target word at time t. The context vector c t is then derived as a weighted average over the set of source hidden states within the window [p t −D, p t +D]; D is empirically selected. 8 Unlike the global approach, the local alignment vector a t is now fixed-dimensional, i.e., ∈ R 2D+1 . We consider two variants of the model as below.</p><p>Monotonic alignment (local-m) -we simply set p t = t assuming that source and target sequences are roughly monotonically aligned. The alignment vector a t is defined according to Eq. (7). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Predictive alignment (local-p) -instead of assuming monotonic alignments, our model predicts an aligned position as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p t = S · sigmoid(v ⊤ p tanh(W p h t ))</formula><p>, (9) W p and v p are the model parameters which will be learned to predict positions. S is the source sentence length. As a result of sigmoid, p t ∈ [0, S]. To favor alignment points near p t , we place a Gaussian distribution centered around p t . Specifically, our alignment weights are now defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a t (s) = align(h t ,h s ) exp − (s − p t ) 2 2σ 2<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We use the same align function as in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref> and the standard deviation is empirically set as σ = D 2 . Note that p t is a real nummber; whereas s is an integer within the window centered at p t . 10 <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Input-feeding approach -Attentional vectorsh t are fed as inputs to the next time steps to inform the model about past alignment decisions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h t Attention Layer B C D &lt;eos&gt; X Y Z X Y Z &lt;eos&gt; A</formula><p>Comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Gregor et al., 2015)</ref> -have proposed a selective attention mechanism, very similar to our local attention, for the image generation task. Their approach allows the model to select an image patch of varying location and zoom. We, instead, use the same "zoom" for all target positions, which greatly simplifies the formulation and still achieves good performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Input-feeding Approach</head><p>In our proposed global and local approaches, the attentional decisions are made independently, which is suboptimal. Whereas, in standard MT, a coverage set is often maintained during the translation process to keep track of which source words have been translated. Likewise, in attentional NMTs, alignment decisions should be made jointly taking into account past alignment information. To address that, we propose an inputfeeding approach in which attentional vectorsh t are concatenated with inputs at the next time steps as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The effects of having such connections are two-fold: (a) we hope to make the model fully aware of previous alignment choices and (b) we create a very deep network spanning both horizontally and vertically.</p><p>Comparison to other work -Bahdanau et al. <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref> use context vectors, similar to our c t , in building subsequent hidden states, which can also achieve the "coverage" effect. However, there has not been any analysis of whether such connections are useful as done <ref type="bibr">11</ref> If n is the number of LSTM cells, the input size of the first LSTM layer is 2n; those of subsequent layers are n. in this work. Also, our approach is more general; as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, it can be applied to general stacking recurrent architectures, including non-attentional models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Xu et al. (2015)</ref> propose a doubly attentional approach with an additional constraint added to the training objective to make sure the model pays equal attention to all parts of the image during the caption generation process. Such a constraint can also be useful to capture the coverage set effect in NMT that we mentioned earlier. However, we chose to use the input-feeding approach since it provides flexibility for the model to decide on any attentional constraints it deems suitable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the effectiveness of our models on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions.</p><p>new-stest2013 (3000 sentences) is used as a development set to select our hyperparameters. Translation performances are reported in case-sensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) on newstest2014 (2737 sentences) and newstest2015 (2169 sentences). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Luong et al., 2015)</ref>, we report translation quality using two types of BLEU: (a) tokenized 12 BLEU to be comparable with existing NMT work and (b) NIST 13 BLEU to be comparable with WMT results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training Details</head><p>All our models are trained on the WMT'14 training data consisting of 4.5M sentences pairs (116M English words, 110M German words).

Additionally, we also use dropout with probability 0.2 for our LSTMs as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Zaremba et al., 2015)</ref>. For dropout models, we train for 12 epochs and start halving the learning rate after 8 epochs. For local attention models, we empirically set the window size D = 10. Our code is implemented in MATLAB. When running on a single GPU device Tesla K40, we achieve a speed of 1K target words per second. It takes 7-10 days to completely train a model.</p></div>

The attentional mechanism gives us +2.2 BLEU gain and on top of that, we obtain another boost of up to +1.0 BLEU from the input-feeding approach.

Our best model (the blue + curve) outperforms all other systems in all length buckets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Choices of Attentional Architectures</head><p>We examine different attention models <ref type="bibr">(global, local-m, local-p)</ref> and different alignment functions (location, dot, general, concat) as described in Section 3. Due to limited resources, we cannot run all the possible combinations. However, results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>    <ref type="bibr">15</ref> It is interesting to observe that dot works well for the global attention and general is better for the local attention. Among the different models, the local attention model with predictive alignments (localp) is best, both in terms of perplexities and BLEU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Alignment Quality</head><p>A by-product of attentional models are word alignments. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref> visualized <ref type="bibr">14</ref> There is a subtle difference in how we retrieve alignments for the different alignment functions. At time step t in which we receive yt−1 as input and then compute ht, at, ct, andht before predicting yt, the alignment vector at is used as alignment weights for (a) the predicted word yt in the location-based alignment functions and (b) the input word yt−1 in the content-based functions. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> With concat, the perplexities achieved by different models are 6.7 (global), 7.1 (local-m), and 7.1 (local-p). Such high perplexities could be due to the fact that we simplify the matrix Wa to set the part that corresponds tohs to identity.</p></div>

In contrast, we set out to evaluate the alignment quality using the alignment error rate (AER) metric.</p><p>Given the gold alignment data provided by RWTH for 508 English-German Europarl sentences, we "force" decode our attentional models to produce translations that match the references. We extract only one-to-one alignments by selecting the source word with the highest alignment weight per target word. Nevertheless, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, we were able to achieve AER scores comparable to the one-to-many alignments obtained by the Berkeley aligner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Liang et al., 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We also found that the alignments produced by local attention models achieve lower AERs than those of the global one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Sample Translations</head><p>We show in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> sample translations in both directions. It it appealing to observe the effect of attentional models in correctly translating names such as "Miranda Kerr" and "Roger Dow". Non-attentional models, while producing sensible names from a language model perspective, lack the direct connections from the source side to make correct translations. We also observed an interesting case in the second example, which requires translating the doubly-negated phrase, "not incompatible".

The visualization of the local attention model is much sharper than that of the global one. This contrast matches our expectation that local attention is designed to only focus on a subset of words each time. Also, since we translate from English to German and reverse the source English sentence, the white strides at the words "reality" and "." in the global attention model reveals an interesting access pattern: it tends to refer back to the beginning of the source sequence.</p><p>Compared to the alignment visualizations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, our alignment patterns are not as sharp as theirs. Such difference could possibly be due to the fact that translating from English to German is harder than translating into French as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>, which is an interesting point to examine in future work.  </p></div>			</div>
