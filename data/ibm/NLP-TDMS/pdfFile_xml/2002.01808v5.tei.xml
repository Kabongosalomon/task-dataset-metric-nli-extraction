<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We study the problem of injecting knowledge into large pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa. Existing methods typically update the original parameters of pre-trained models when injecting knowledge. However, when multiple kinds of knowledge are injected, the historically injected knowledge would be flushed away. To address this, we propose K-ADAPTER, a framework that retains the original parameters of the pre-trained model fixed and supports the development of versatile knowledge-infused model. Taking RoBERTa as the backbone model, K-ADAPTER has a neural adapter for each kind of infused knowledge, like a plug-in connected to RoBERTa. There is no information flow between different adapters, thus multiple adapters can be efficiently trained in a distributed way. As a case study, we inject two kinds of knowledge in this work, including (1) factual knowledge obtained from automatically aligned texttriplets on Wikipedia and Wikidata and (2) linguistic knowledge obtained via dependency parsing. Results on three knowledge-driven tasks, including relation classification, entity typing, and question answering, demonstrate that each adapter improves the performance and the combination of both adapters brings further improvements. Further analysis indicates that K-ADAPTER captures versatile knowledge than RoBERTa. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Language representation models, which are pretrained on large-scale text corpus through unsupervised objectives like (masked) language modeling, such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Radford et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Radford et al., , 2019</ref>, XLNet <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., *</ref> Work is done during internship at Microsoft. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Codes are publicly available at https://github. com/microsoft/k-adapter 2019), RoBERTa  and T5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Raffel et al., 2019)</ref>, have established state-of-the-art performances on various NLP downstream tasks. Despite the huge success of these pre-trained models in empirical studies, recent studies suggest that models learned in such an unsupervised manner struggle to capture rich knowledge. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Poerner et al. (2019)</ref> suggest that although language models do well in reasoning about the surface form of entity names, they fail in capturing rich factual knowledge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kassner and Schütze (2019)</ref> observe that BERT mostly did not learn the meaning of negation (e.g. "not"). These observations motivate us to study the injection of knowledge into pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa.</p><p>Recently, some efforts have been made to exploit injecting knowledge into pre-trained language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lauscher et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levine et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Peters et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">He et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Xiong et al., 2020)</ref>. Most previous works (as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) augment the standard language modeling objective with knowledge-driven objectives and update the entire model parameters. Although these methods obtain better performance on downstream tasks, they struggle at supporting the development of versatile models with multiple kinds of knowledge injected <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)</ref>. When new kinds of knowledge are injected, model parameters need to be retrained so that previously injected knowledge would fade away. Meanwhile, the resulting models produce entangled representations, so that it is hard to investigate the effect of each kind of knowledge.</p><p>In this paper, we propose K-ADAPTER, a flexible and simple framework that supports the infusion of multiple kinds of knowledge into large pretrained models. K-ADAPTER leaves the original representation of a pre-trained model unchanged and exports different representations for different types of infused knowledge.

In the pre-training phase, we train two adapters independently. Since adapters have much less trainable parameters compared with RoBERTa, the training process is memory efficient. We conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three knowledge-driven tasks, i.e., relation classification, entity typing, and question answering. Experiments show that K-ADAPTER consistently performs better than RoBERTa, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets. Case study and probing experiments indicate that K-ADAPTER captures versatile knowledge than RoBERTa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Our work relates to the area of injecting knowledge into pre-trained models. As stated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, previous works mainly differ from the knowledge sources and the objective used for training.</p><p>ERNIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2019)</ref> injects a knowledge graph into BERT. They align entities from Wikipedia sentences to fact triples in WikiData, and discard sentences with less than three entities. In the training process, the input includes sentences and linked facts, and the knowledge-aware learning objective is to predict the correct token-entity alignment. Entity embeddings are trained on fact triples from WikiData via TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bordes et al., 2013)</ref>. LIBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lauscher et al., 2019)</ref> injects pairs of words with synonym and hyponym-hypernym relations in WordNet. The model takes a pair of words separated by a special token as the input, and is optimized by a binary classification problem, which predicts whether the input holds a particular relation or not. SenseBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Levine et al., 2019)</ref> considers word-supersense knowledge. It inject knowledge by predicting the supersense of the masked word in the input, where the candidates are nouns and verbs and the ground truth comes from WordNet. <ref type="bibr">KnowBERT (Peters et al., 2019)</ref> incorporates knowledge bases into BERT using Knowledge attention and recontextualization, where the knowledge comes from synset-synset and lemmalemma relationships in WordNet, and entity linking information in Wikipedia. If entity linking supervision is available, the model is learned with an additional knowledge-aware log-likelihood or maxmargin objective. WKLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Xiong et al., 2020)</ref> replaces entity mentions in the original document with names of other entities of the same type. The model is trained to distinguish the correct entity mention from randomly chosen ones. BERT-MK <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(He et al., 2019)</ref> integrates fact triples from knowledge graph. For each entity, it sample incoming and outcoming instances from the neighbors on the knowledge graph, and replaces head or tail entity to create negative instances. The model is learned to discriminate between real and fake facts.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: (a) Pre-trained language models inject multiple kinds of knowledge with multi-task learning. Model parameters need to be retrained when injecting new kinds of knowledge, which may result in the catastrophic forgetting (b) Our K-ADAPTER injects multiple kinds of knowledge by training adapters independently on different pre-train tasks, which supports continual knowledge infusion. When we inject new kinds of knowledge, the existing knowledge-specific adapters will not be affected. KIA represents the adapter layer and TRM represents the transformer layer, both of which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As shown in</head><p>we consider both fact-related objective (i.e. predicate/relation prediction) and linguistic-related objective (i.e. dependency relation prediction). Second, the original parameter of BERT is clamped in the knowledge infusion process. Third, our approach supports continual learning, which means that the learning of different adapters are not entangled. This flexibility enables us to efficiently inject different types of knowledge independently, and inject more types of knowledge without any loss on the previously injected knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">K-ADAPTER</head><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (a), most of the previous works enhance pre-trained language models by injecting knowledge and update model parameters through multi-task learning. Regardless of these different versions of knowledge-injected methods with multi-task learning, common issues not fully studied are catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. To address this, we present K-ADAPTER as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b), where multiple kinds of knowledge are injected into different compact neural models (i.e., adapters in this paper) individually instead of directly injecting knowledge into pre-trained models. It keeps the original representation of a pre-trained model fixed and supports continual knowledge infusion, i.e., injecting each kind of knowledge into the corresponding knowledge-specific adapter and producing disen-tangled representation. Specifically, adapters are knowledge-specific models (with few parameters) plugged outside of a pre-trained model. The inputs of adapters are the output hidden-states of intermediate layers of the pre-trained model. Each adapter is pre-trained independently on different tasks for injecting discriminative knowledge while the original parameters of the pre-trained model are frozen. In this paper, we exploit RoBERTa  as the pre-trained model, and mainly infuse factual knowledge and linguistic knowledge with two kinds of adapters, i.e., factual adapter and linguistic adapter which are pre-trained on the relation classification task and dependency relation prediction task respectively. In this section, we first describe the structure of our adapter, and then present the process of pre-training knowledgespecific adapters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Adapter Structure</head><p>In this work, we present a different adapter structure as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, which is referred to as the knowledge-specific adapter. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Houlsby et al. (2019)</ref> add adapter layers into each transformer layer, our adapter works as outside plug-ins. Each adapter model consists of K adapter layers that contain N transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> layers and two projection layers. A skipconnection is applied across two projection layers. Specifically, for each adapter model, we plug adapter layers among different transformer layers of the pre-trained model. We concatenate the output hidden feature of the transformer layer in the pre-trained model and the output feature of the former adapter layer, as the input feature of the current adapter layer. For each knowledge-specific adapter, we concatenate the last hidden features of the pre-trained model and adapter as the final output feature of this adapter model. In the pre-training procedure, we train each knowledge-specific adapter on different pretraining tasks individually. For various downstream tasks, K-ADAPTER can adopt the fine-tuning procedure similar to RoBERTa and BERT. When only one knowledge-specific adapter is adopted, we can take the final output feature of this adapter model as the input for task-specific layers of the downstream task. When multiple knowledge-specific adapters are adopted, we concatenate the output features of different adapter models as the input for task-specific layers of the downstream task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Pre-training settings</head><p>We use RoBERTa LARGE (L=24, H=1024, A=16, 355M params) implementation by Huggingface 2 as the pre-trained model in all our experiments. As for each adapter layer, we denote the number of transformer layer as N , the hidden dimension of transformer layer as H A , the number of self-attention heads as A A , the hidden dimension of down-projection and up-projection layers as H d and H u . In detail, we have the following adapter size: N = 2, H A = 768, A A = 12, H u = 1024 and H d = 768. The RoBERTa lay-2 https://github.com/huggingface/transformers ers where adapter layers plug in are {0,11,23}, and different adapter layers do not share parameters. Thus the total parameters for each adapter model are about 42M, which are much smaller than RoBERTa LARGE and make the training process memory efficient. It should be noticed that RoBERTa is fixed during training and the parameters of adapters are trainable and initialized randomly. Then we describe how to inject different knowledge into knowledge-specific adapters as below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Factual Adapter</head><p>Factual knowledge can be described as the basic information that is concerned with facts. In this work, we acquire factual knowledge from the relationships among entities in natural language. We extract a sub-dataset T-REx-rc from T-REx <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(ElSahar et al., 2018)</ref> which is a large scale alignment dataset between Wikipedia abstracts and Wikidata triples. We discard all relations having less than 50 entity pairs, collecting 430 relations and 5.5M sentences. In order to inject factual knowledge, we propose to pre-train a knowledge-specific adapter called facAdapter on the relation classification task. This task requires a model to classify relation labels of given entity pairs based on context. Specifically, the last hidden features of RoBERTa and facAdapter are concatenated as the input representation, and the pooling layer is applied to the input representations of the given entities. Then, we concatenate two entity representations to perform relation classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Linguistic Adapter</head><p>Linguistic knowledge is implicitly contained in natural language texts, e.g., syntactic and semantic information. In this work, we acquire linguistic knowledge from dependency relationships among words in natural language text. We build a dataset consisting of 1M examples. In particular, we run the off-the-shell dependency parser from Stanford Parser 3 on a part of Book Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhu et al., 2015)</ref>. To inject linguistic knowledge, we pre-train another knowledge-specific adapter called linAdapter on the task of dependency relation prediction. This task aims to predict the head index of each token in the given sentence. We concatenate the last hidden features of RoBERTa and linAdapter as the input representation, and then apply a linear layer 3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.html  to input representations of each token to perform classification. More training details of facAdapter and linAdapter can be found in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate our K-ADAPTER on three knowledgedriven downstream tasks, i.e., entity typing, question answering and relation classification. Furthermore, we conduct detailed analyses with the case study and probing experiments to explore the effectiveness and ability of models for learning factual knowledge. The notations of K-ADAPTER (F+L), K-ADAPTER (F), and K-ADAPTER (L) denote our model which consists of both factual adapter and linguistic adapter, only factual adapter and only linguistic adapter, respectively. Implementation details, and statistics of datasets are in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Entity Typing</head><p>We conduct experiments on fine-grained entity typing which aims to predict the types of a given entity and its context. We evaluate our models on Ope-nEntity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Choi et al., 2018)</ref> and FIGER <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ling et al., 2015)</ref> following the same split setting as <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al. (2019)</ref>. To fine-tune our models for entity typing, we modify the input token sequence by adding the special token "@" before and after a certain entity, then the first "@" special token representation is adopted to perform classification. As for OpenEntity, we adopt micro F 1 score as the final metric to represent the model performance. As for FIGER, we adopt strict accuracy, loose macro, loose micro F 1 scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ling and Weld, 2012)</ref> for evaluation following the same evaluation criteria used in previous works.</p><p>Baselines NFGEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shimaoka et al., 2016)</ref> employs attentive recursive neural networks to compose context representations. KEPLER <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref> integrates factual knowledge with the supervision of the knowledge embedding objective.</p><p>RoBERTa+multitask is our RoBERTa model pretrained with multi-task learning (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  1(a)</ref>) for injecting multiple kinds of knowledge on two pre-training tasks. K-ADAPTER (w/o knowledge) consists of a RoBERTa model and an adapter without being injected knowledge. Other baseline models are described in Section 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The results on OpenEntity and FIGER are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. K-ADAPTER (F+L) achieves consistent improvements across these datasets. As for OpenEntity, our RoBERTa achieve better results than other baseline models. K-ADAPTER (F+L) further achieves improvement of 1.38% F 1 over RoBERTa, which means factual knowledge and linguistic knowledge help to predict the types more accurately. As for FIGER, it covers more entity types, and is more fine-grained than OpenEntity. Compared with WKLM, K-ADAPTER (F+L) improves the macro F 1 by 2.88%, micro F 1 by 2.54% and accuracy by 1.60%. This demonstrates that K-ADAPTER (F+L) benefits finegrained entity typing.</p><p>In addition, we further conduct several experiments on our ablated model K-ADAPTER (w/o knowledge), to explore whether the performance gains came from introducing knowledge or additional parameters. Results show that K-ADAPTER (F) significantly outperforms K-ADAPTER (w/o knowledge). Moreover, it is worth noting that on OpenEntity dataset, K-ADAPTER (w/o knowledge) even performs slightly worse than RoBERTa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Question Answering</head><p>We conduct experiments on two question answering (QA) tasks, i.e., commonsense QA and open-domain QA. Commonsense QA aims to answer questions with commonsense. We adopt CosmosQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huang et al., 2019)</ref> to evaluate our models.</p><p>CosmosQA requires commonsense-based reading comprehension, formulated as multiple-choice questions. To finetune our models for CosmosQA, the input token sequence is modified as "&lt;SEP&gt;context &lt;/SEP&gt;question&lt;/SEP&gt;answer&lt;/SEP&gt;", then the representation of the first token is adopted to perform classification, and will get a score for this answer. After getting four scores, the answer with the highest score will be selected. We report accuracy scores obtained from the leaderboard.</p><p>Open-domain QA aims to answer questions using external resources such as collections of documents and webpages. We evaluate our modes on two public datasets, i.e., Quasar-T <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dhingra et al., 2017)</ref> and SearchQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dunn et al., 2017)</ref>. Specifically, we first retrieve paragraphs corresponding to the question using the information retrieval system and then extract the answer from these retrieved paragraphs through the reading comprehension technique. Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lin et al., 2018)</ref>, we use the retrieved paragraphs provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al. (2017b)</ref> for these two datasets.</p><p>To fine-tune our models for this task, the input token sequence is modified as "&lt;SEP&gt;question &lt;/SEP&gt;paragraph&lt;/SEP&gt;". We apply linear layers over the last hidden features of our model to predict the start and end position of the answer span. We adopt two metrics including ExactMatch (EM) and loose F 1 (Ling and Weld, 2012) scores to evaluate our models.</p><p>Baselines BERT-FT RACE+SW AG <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huang et al., 2019</ref>) is the BERT model sequentially fine-tuned on both RACE and SWAG datasets. BiDAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Seo et al., 2016</ref>) adopts a bi-directional attention network. AQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Buck et al., 2018)</ref> proposes to re-write questions and aggregate the answers generated by the re-written questions. Rˆ3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wang et al., 2017a</ref>) is a reinforced model making use of a ranker for selecting most confident paragraph.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The results on Cos-mosQA are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. Compared with BERT-FT RACE+SW AG , our RoBERTa significantly achieves 11.89% improvement of accuracy. Compared to RoBERTa, K-ADAPTER (F+L) further improves the accuracy by 1.24%, which indicates that K-ADAPTER can obtain better commonsense inference ability. Moreover, the perfor-  mance of ablated K-ADAPTER models, i.e., K-ADAPTER (F) and K-ADAPTER (L) are clearly better than RoBERTa, but slightly lose compared with RoBERTa+multitask. It is notable that K-ADAPTER (F+L) makes obvious improvement comparing with RoBERTa+multitask. This demonstrates that the combination of multiple knowledgespecific adapters could achieve better performance.</p><p>The results for open-domain QA are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. K-ADAPTER models achieve better results compared to other baselines. This indicates that K-ADAPTER models can make full use of the infused knowledge and accordingly benefit understanding the retrieved paragraphs to answer the question. Specifically, on SearchQA, K-ADAPTER (F+L) makes significant improvement of 4.01% F 1 scores, comparing with WKLM where the ranking scores are not used, and even has a slight improvement as compared to WKLM+Ranking. It is worth noting that K-ADAPTER models do not consider the confidence of each retrieved paragraph, while WKLM+Ranking utilizes ranking scores from a BERT based ranker. On the Quasar-T dataset, K-ADAPTER (F+L) also outperforms WKLM by 3.1% F 1 score and slightly outperforms WKLM+Ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Relation Classification</head><p>Relation classification aims to determine the correct relation between two entities in a given sentence. We adopt a large-scale relation classification dataset TACRED <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. To fine-tune our models for this task, we modify the input token sequence by adding special token "@" before and after the first entity, adding "#" before and after the second entity. Then the token representations of the first special token "@" and "#" are concatenated to perform relation classification. We adopt micro F 1 score as the metric to represent the model performance as previous works.</p><p>Baselines C-GCN  employs graph convolutional networks to model dependency trees. BERT-large <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Baldini Soares et al., 2019)</ref> is a baseline BERT-large model. BERT+MTB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baldini Soares et al., 2019</ref>) is a method of training relation representation without supervision from a knowledge base by matching the blanks. Other baseline models are described in Section 2 and 4.1. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> shows the performances of different models on TACRED. The results indicate that K-ADAPTER models significantly outperform all baselines, which directly demonstrate our models can benefit relation classification. In particular, (1) K-ADAPTER models outperform RoBERTa, which proves the effectiveness of infusing knowledge into pre-trained model with adapters. (2) K-ADAPTER models gain more improvement compared with RoBERTa+multitask. This directly demonstrates injecting knowledge individually in K-ADAPTER way would help models make full use of knowledge. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> gives a qualitative comparison example between K-ADAPTER and RoBERTa on relation classification dataset TACRED. The results show that, in most cases, the wrongly predicted logit value of RoBERTa and the logit value of the true label are actually quite close. For example, given "New Fabris closed down ::::</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Case Study</head><p>June :: 16", RoBERTa predicts "no relation", but the true label "city of birth" ranks in second place. If a model could correctly predict the relationship between "New Fabris" and "June 16", then it needs to know that "New Fabris" is a company. Thanks to the factual knowledge in K-ADAPTER, it can help the model from predicting "no relation" to predicting the correct category label.</p><p>In addition, we utilize a LAMA (LAnguage Model Analysis) probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Petroni et al., 2019)</ref> to examine models' ability to memorize factual knowledge. Specifically, the LAMA probing task is under a zero-shot setting, which requires the language model to answer cloze-style questions about relational facts without fine-tuning, For example, given "Simon Bowman was born in [MASK]" as the input, models are asked to predict the correct token   which is masked. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> shows several examples for the generation of RoBERTa LARGE and K-ADAPTER for LAMA queries. From these examples, we can find that the objects predicted by K-ADAPTER are more accurate, which demonstrate that K-ADAPTER captures richer factual knowledge than RoBERTa. More details about this probing experiments can be found in the Appendix A and E.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a flexible and simple approach, called K-ADAPTER, to infuse knowledge into large pre-trained models. K-ADAPTER remains the original parameters of pre-trained models unchanged and supports continual knowledge infusion, i.e., new kinds of injected-knowledge will not affect the parameters learned for old knowledge. Specifically, factual knowledge and linguistic knowledge are infused into RoBERTa with two kinds of adapters, which are pre-trained on the relation classification task and dependency relation prediction task, respectively. Extensive experiments on three knowledge-driven downstream tasks demonstrate that the performance of each adapter achieves a significant improvement individually, and even more together. Detailed analyses further suggest that K-ADAPTER captures richer factual and commonsense knowledge than RoBERTa, and provide insights on the effectiveness of knowledge infusion. In future work, we will infuse more types of knowledge, and apply our framework to more pre-trained models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Results are shown in Table 7. It is surprising that BERT LARGE performs better than RoBERTa LARGE . There is one possible reason: BERT uses a character-level BPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gage, 1994)</ref> vocabulary, while RoBERTa considers bytelevel BPE vocabulary. This finding indicates that, although using bytes makes it possible to learn a subword vocabulary that can encode any text without introducing "unknown" tokens, it might indirectly harm the model's ability to learn factual knowledge, e.g., some proper nouns may be divided into bytes. Thus in the following experiments, we do not take BERT into account. K-ADAPTER outperforms other models (except for BERT) by a huge margin. As for LAMA, com-pared to RoBERTa LARGE , K-ADAPTER obtains 2.2% and 1.2% P@1 improvement across Google-RE and T-REx, respectively. Moreover, compared to RoBERTa LARGE , K-ADAPTER still achieves better results on LAMA-UHN. The results demonstrate that K-ADAPTER captures richer factual and commonsense knowledge than RoBERTa. The pre-trained model is fixed during training and the parameters of the factual adapter are trainable and initialized randomly. The model is trained with cross-entropy loss. To accelerate the training process, we set the max sequence length as 64 as the average sequence length of T-REx-rc is only 22.8. We train the model for 5 epochs using a batch size of 128. We use AdamW to optimize our models with the initial learning rate of 2e-5. We train the model with 4 16G NVIDIA V100 GPUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Linguistic Adapter</head><p>Same as the training process of the factual adapter, the pre-trained model is fixed during training and the parameters of the linguistic adapter are trainable and initialized randomly. The model is trained with BCEWithLogits loss. We set the max sequence length as 128. We train the model for 10 epochs using a batch size of 256. We use AdamW with the initial learning rate of 1e-5. We train the model with 4 16G NVIDIA V100 GPUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Applying K-adapter on Downstream Tasks</head><p>For the downstream tasks, the key point here is the combination of the pre-trained model's representations and adapter's representations, that is to say: leveraging the general information of the pre-trained model on one hand, and the specific knowledge in the adapter on the other. To use K-ADAPTER for downstream tasks is very simple as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. Usually, when we use pre-trained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa for downstream tasks, we feed the output features from the pre-trained model into the task-specific layer, and then do the corresponding downstream task. As for the K-ADAPTER, we finetune it just like what the orginal BERT or RoBERTa does. We concatenate the output features of the pretrained model with the features of the adapter, and then feed them to the task-specific layer.   <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: An overview of our K-ADAPTER to inject specific knowledge by training a knowledge-specific adapter on the pre-training task.</p></div>
