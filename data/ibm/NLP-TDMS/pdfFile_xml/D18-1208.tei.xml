			<abstract>
				<p>We carry out experiments with deep learning models of summarization across the domains of news, personal stories, meetings, and medical articles in order to understand how content selection is performed. We find that many sophisticated features of state of the art extractive summarizers do not improve performance over simpler models. These results suggest that it is easier to create a summarizer for a new domain than previous work suggests and bring into question the benefit of deep learning models for summarization for those domains that do have massive datasets (i.e., news). At the same time, they suggest important questions for new research in summarization; namely, new forms of sentence representations or external knowledge sources are needed that are better suited to the sumarization task.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Content selection is a central component in many natural language generation tasks, where, given a generation goal, the system must determine which information should be expressed in the output text <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gatt and Krahmer, 2018)</ref>. In summarization, content selection is usually accomplished through sentence (and, occasionally, phrase) extraction. Despite being a key component of both extractive and abstractive summarization systems, it is is not well understood how deep learning models perform content selection with only word and sentence embedding based features as input. Nonneural network approaches often use frequency and information theoretic measures as proxies for content salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hong and Nenkova, 2014</ref>), but these are not explicitly used in most neural network summarization systems.</p><p>In this paper, we seek to better understand how deep learning models of summarization perform content selection across multiple domains ( § 4): news, personal stories, meetings, and medical articles (for which we collect a new corpus). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We analyze several recent sentence extractive neural network architectures, specifically considering the design choices for sentence encoders ( § 3.1) and sentence extractors <ref type="bibr">( § 3.2)</ref>. We compare Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based sentence representations to the simpler approach of word embedding averaging to understand the gains derived from more sophisticated architectures. We also question the necessity of auto-regressive sentence extraction (i.e. using previous predictions to inform future predictions), which previous approaches have used ( § 2), and propose two alternative models that extract sentences independently.</p><p>Our main results ( § 5) reveal:</p><p>1. Sentence position bias dominates the learning signal for news summarization, though not for other domains. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Summary quality for news is only slightly degraded when content words are omitted from sentence embeddings. 2. Word embedding averaging is as good or better than either RNNs or CNNs for sentence embedding across all domains. 3. Pre-trained word embeddings are as good, or better than, learned embeddings in five of six datasets. 4. Non auto-regressive sentence extraction performs as good or better than auto-regressive extraction in all domains.</p><p>Taken together, these and other results in the paper suggest that we are over-estimating the abil-ity of deep learning models to learn robust and meaningful content features for summarization. In one sense, this might lessen the burden of applying neural network models of content to other domains; one really just needs in-domain word embeddings. However, if we want to learn something other than where the start of the article is, we will need to design other means of sentence representation, and possibly external knowledge representations, better suited to the summarization task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The introduction of the CNN-DailyMail corpus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hermann et al. (2015)</ref> allowed for the application of large-scale training of deep learning models for summarization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref> developed a sentence extractive model that uses a word level CNN to encode sentences and a sentence level sequence-to-sequence model to predict which sentences to include in the summary. Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a different model using word-level bidirectional RNNs along with a sentence level bidirectional RNN for predicting which sentences should be extracted. Their sentence extractor creates representations of the whole document and computes separate scores for salience, novelty, and location. These works represent the state-of-the-art for deep learningbased extractive summarization and we analyze them further in this paper.</p><p>Other recent neural network approaches include, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yasunaga et al. (2017)</ref>, who learn a graphconvolutional network (GCN) for multi-document summarization. They do not closely examine the choice of sentence encoder, which is one of the focuses of the present paper; rather, they study the best choice of graph structure for the GCN, which is orthogonal to this work.</p><p>Non-neural network learning-based approaches have also been applied to summarization. Typically they involve learning n-gram feature weights in linear models along with other non-lexical word or structural features <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sipos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durrett et al., 2016)</ref>. In this paper, we study representation learning in neural networks that can capture more complex word level feature interactions and whose dense representations are more compatible with current practices in NLP.</p><p>The previously mentioned works have focused on news summarization. To further understand the content selection process, we also explore other domains of summarization. In particular, we explore personal narrative summarization based on stories shared on Reddit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ouyang et al., 2017)</ref>, workplace meeting summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carletta et al., 2005)</ref>, and medical journal article summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mishra et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>While most work on these summarization tasks often exploit domain-specific features (e.g. speaker identification in meeting summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Galley, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gillick et al., 2009)</ref>), we purposefully avoid such features in this work in order to understand the extent to which deep learning models can perform content selection using only surface lexical features. Summarization of academic literature (including medical journals), has long been a research topic in NLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kupiec et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elhadad et al., 2005</ref>), but most approaches have explored facet-based summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jaidka et al., 2017)</ref>, which is not the focus of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>The goal of extractive text summarization is to select a subset of a document's text to use as a summary, i.e. a short gist or excerpt of the central content. Typically, we impose a budget on the length of the summary in either words or bytes. In this work, we focus on sentence extractive summarization, where the basic unit of extraction is a sentence and impose a word limit as the budget.</p><p>We model the sentence extraction task as a sequence tagging problem, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Conroy and O'Leary, 2001)</ref>. Specifically, given a document containing n sentences s 1 , . . . , s n we generate a summary by predicting a corresponding label sequence y 1 , . . . , y n ∈ {0, 1} n , where y i = 1 indicates the i-th sentence is to be included in the summary. Each sentence is itself a sequence of word embeddings s i = w</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(i) 1 , . . . , w (i)</formula><p>|s i | where |s i | is the length of the sentence in words. The word budget c ∈ N enforces a constraint that the total summary word length � n i=1 y i · |s i | ≤ c. For a typical deep learning model of extractive summarization there are two main design decisions: a) the choice of sentence encoder which maps each sentence s i to an embedding h i , and b) the choice of sentence extractor which maps a sequence of sentence embeddings h = h 1 , . . . , h n to a sequence of extraction decisions y = y 1 , . . . , y n . </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a) h1 h2 h3 y1 y2 y3 b) h1 h2 h3 − → h h1 h2 h3 ← − h y1 y2 y3 c) h1 h2 h3 h * h1 h2 y1 y2 y3 d) h1 h2 h3 y1 y2 y3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sentence Encoders</head><p>We experiment with three architectures for mapping sequences of word embeddings to a fixed length vector: averaging, RNNs, and CNNs. Hyperparameter settings and implementation details can be found in Appendix A.</p><p>Averaging Encoder Under the averaging encoder, a sentence embedding h is simply the average of its word embeddings, i.e. h = 1 |s| � |s| i=1 w i . RNN Encoder When using the RNN sentence encoder, a sentence embedding is the concatenation of the final output states of a forward and backward RNN over the sentence's word embeddings. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the RNN cell ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chung et al., 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CNN Encoder</head><p>The CNN sentence encoder uses a series of convolutional feature maps to encode each sentence. This encoder is similar to the convolutional architecture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kim (2014)</ref> used for text classification tasks and performs a series of "one-dimensional" convolutions over word embeddings. The final sentence embedding h is a concatenation of all the convolutional filter outputs after max pooling over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sentence Extractors</head><p>Sentence extractors take sentence embeddings h 1:n and produce an extract y 1:n . The sentence extractor is essentially a discriminative classifier p(y 1:n |h 1:n ). Previous neural network approaches to sentence extraction have assumed an auto-regressive model, leading to a semiMarkovian factorization of the extractor probabilities p(y 1:n |h) = � n i=1 p(y i |y &lt;i , h), where each prediction y i is dependent on all previous y j for all j &lt; i. We compare two such models proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Nallap- ati et al. (2017)</ref>. A simpler approach that does not allow interaction among the y 1:n is to model p(y 1:n |h) = � n i=1 p(y i |h), which we explore in two proposed extractor models that we refer to as the RNN and Seq2Seq extractors. Implementation details for all extractors are in Appendix B.</p><p>Previously Proposed Sentence Extractors We consider two recent state-of-the-art extractors.</p><p>The first, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref>, is built around a sequence-to-sequence model. First, each sentence embedding 3 is fed into an encoder side RNN, with the final encoder state passed to the first step of the decoder RNN. On the decoder side, the same sentence embeddings are fed as input to the decoder and decoder outputs are used to predict each y i . The decoder input is weighted by the previous extraction probability, inducing the dependence of y i on y &lt;i . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">See Fig- ure 1</ref>.c for a graphical layout of the extractor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a sentence extractor, which we refer to as the SummaRunner Extractor, that factorizes the extraction probability into contributions from different sources. First, a bidirectional RNN is run over the sentence em-beddings <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and the output is concatenated. A representation of the whole document is made by averaging the RNN output. A summary representation is also constructed by taking the sum of the previous RNN outputs weighted by their extraction probabilities. Extraction predictions are made using the RNN output at the i-th step, the document representation, and i-th version of the summary representation, along with factors for sentence location in the document. The use of the iteratively constructed summary representation creates a dependence of y i on all y &lt;i . See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.d for a graphical layout.</p><p>Proposed Sentence Extractors We propose two sentence extractor models that make a stronger conditional independence assumption p(y|h) = � n i=1 p(y i |h), essentially making independent predictions conditioned on h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNN Extractor</head><p>Our first proposed model is a very simple bidirectional RNN based tagging model. As in the RNN sentence encoder we use a GRU cell. The forward and backward outputs of each sentence are passed through a multi-layer perceptron with a logsitic sigmoid output to predict the probability of extracting each sentence. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.a for a graphical layout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seq2Seq</head><p>Extractor One shortcoming of the RNN extractor is that long range information from one end of the document may not easily be able to affect extraction probabilities of sentences at the other end. Our second proposed model, the Seq2Seq extractor mitigates this problem with an attention mechanism commonly used for neural machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al., 2014</ref>) and abstractive summarization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">See et al., 2017</ref>). The sentence embeddings are first encoded by a bidirectional GRU. A separate decoder GRU transforms each sentence into a query vector which attends to the encoder output. The attention weighted encoder output and the decoder GRU output are concatenated and fed into a multi-layer perceptron to compute the extraction probability. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.b for a graphical layout.</p></div>

While there is more performance variability in the Reddit and AMI data, there is less distinction among systems: no differences are significant on Reddit and every extractor has at least one configuration that is indistinguishable from the best system on the AMI corpus. This is probably due to the small test size of these datasets.</p><p>Word Embedding Learning Given that learning a sentence encoder (averaging has no learned parameters) does not yield significant improvement, it is natural to consider whether learning word embeddings is also necessary. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> we compare the performance of different extractors using the averaging encoder, when the word embeddings are held fixed or learned during training. In both cases, word embeddings are initialized with GloVe embeddings trained on a combination of Gigaword and Wikipedia. When learning embeddings, words occurring fewer than three times in the training data are mapped to an unknown token (with learned embedding).</p><p>In all but one case, fixed embeddings are as good or better than the learned embeddings. This is a somewhat surprising finding on the CNN/DM data since it is reasonably large, and learning embeddings should give the models more flexibility to identify important word features. 8 This sug- <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The AMI corpus is an exception here where learning gests that we cannot extract much generalizable learning signal from the content other than what is already present from initialization. Even on PubMed, where the language is quite different from the news/Wikipedia articles the GloVe embeddings were trained on, learning leads to significantly worse results.</p><p>POS Tag Ablation It is also not well explored what word features are being used by the encoders. To understand which classes of words were most important we ran an ablation study, selectively removing nouns, verbs (including participles and auxiliaries), adjectives &amp; adverbs, and function words (adpositions, determiners, conjunctions). All datasets were automatically tagged using the spaCy part-of-speech (POS) tagger <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . The embeddings of removed words were replaced with a zero vector, preserving the order and position of the non-ablated words in the sentence. Ablations were performed on training, validation, and test partitions, using the RNN extractor with averaging encoder. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the results of the POS tag ablation experiments. While removing any word class from the representation generally hurts performance (with statistical significance), on the news domains, the absolute values of the does lead to small performance boosts, however, only in the Seq2Seq extractor is this diference significant; it is quite possible that this is an artifact of the very small test set size. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> https://github.com/explosion/spaCy differences are quite small (.18 on CNN/DM, .41 on NYT, .3 on DUC) suggesting that the model's predictions are not overly dependent on any particular word types. On the non-news datasets, the ablations have a larger effect (max differences are 1.89 on Reddit, 2.56 on AMI, and 1.3 on PubMed). Removing nouns leads to the largest drop on AMI and PubMed. Removing adjectives and adverbs leads to the largest drop on Reddit, suggesting the intensifiers and descriptive words are useful for identifying important content in personal narratives. Curiously, removing the function word POS class yields a significant improvement on DUC 2002 and AMI. Document Shuffling Sentence position is a well known and powerful feature for news summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hong and Nenkova, 2014</ref>), owing to the intentional lead bias in the news article writing <ref type="bibr">10</ref> ; it also explains the difficulty in beating the lead baseline for single-document summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nenkova, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brandow et al., 1999</ref>). In examining the generated summaries, we found most of the selected sentences in the news domain came from the lead paragraph of the document. This is despite the fact that there is a long tail of sentence extractions from later in the document in the ground truth extract summaries (31%, 28.3%, and 11.4% of DUC, CNN/DM, and NYT training extract labels come from the second half of the document). Because this lead bias is so strong, it is questionable whether the models are learning to identify important content or just find the start of the document. We conduct a sentence order experiment where each document's sentences are randomly shuffled during training. We then evaluate each model performance on the unshuffled test data, comparing to the model trained on unshuffled data; if the models trained on shuffled data drop in performance, then this indicates the lead bias is the relevant factor. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the results of the shuffling experiments. The news domains and PubMed suffer a significant drop in performance when the document order is shuffled. By comparison, there is no significant difference between the shuffled and inorder models on the Reddit domain, and shuffling actually improves performance on AMI. This suggest that position is being learned by the models in the news/journal article domain even when the model has no explicit position features, and that this feature is more important than either content or function words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Learning content selection for summarization in the news domain is severely inhibited by the lead bias. The summaries generated by all systems described here-the prior work and our proposed simplified models-are highly similar to each other and to the lead baseline. The Cheng &amp; Lapata and Seq2Seq extractors (using the averaging encoder) share 87.8% of output sentences on average on the CNN/DM data, with similar numbers for the other news domains (see <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> for a typical example). Also on CNN/DM, 58% of the Seq2Seq selected sentences also occur in the lead summary, with similar numbers for DUC, NYT, and Reddit. Shuffling reduces lead overlap to 35.2% but the overall system performance drops significantly; the models are not able to identify important information without position.</p><p>The relative robustness of the news domain to part of speech ablation also suggests that models are mostly learning to recognize the stylistic features unique to the beginning of the article, and not the content. Additionally, the drop in performance when learning word embeddings on the news domain suggests that word embeddings alone do not provide very generalizable content features compared to recognizing the lead.</p><p>The picture is rosier for non-news summarization where part of speech ablation leads to larger performance differences and shuffling either does not inhibit content selection significantly or leads to modest gains. Learning better word-level representations on these domains will likely require much larger corpora, something which might remain unlikely for personal stories and meetings.</p><p>The lack of distinction among sentence encoders is interesting because it echoes findings in the generic sentence embedding literature where word embedding averaging is frustratingly difficult to outperform <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Iyyer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wieting et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arora et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wieting and Gim- pel, 2017)</ref>. The inability to learn useful sentence representations is also borne out in the SummaRunner model, where there are explicit similarity computations between document or summary representations and sentence embeddings; these computations do not seem to add much to the per-formance as the Cheng &amp; Lapata and Seq2Seq models which lack these features generally perform as well or better. Furthermore, the Cheng &amp; Lapata and SummaRunner extractors both construct a history of previous selection decisions to inform future choices but this does not seem to significantly improve performance over the Seq2Seq extractor (which does not). This suggests that we need to rethink or find novel forms of sentence representation for the summarization task.</p><p>A manual examination of the outputs revealed some interesting failure modes, although in general it was hard to discern clear patterns of behaviour other than lead bias. On the news domain, the models consistently learned to ignore quoted material in the lead, as often the quotes provide color to the story but are unlikely to be included in the summary (e.g. "It was like somebody slugging a punching bag."). This behavior was most likely triggered by the presence of quotes, as the quote attributions, which were often tokenized as separate sentences, would subsequently be included in the summary despite also not containing much information (e.g. Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented an empirical study of deep learning based content selection algorithms for summarization. Our findings suggest such models face stark limitations on their ability to learn robust features for this task and that more work is needed on sentence representation for summarization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Sentence extractor architectures: a) RNN, b) Seq2Seq, c) Cheng &amp; Lapata, and d) SummaRunner.

ent biases within each domain can affect content 
selection. The corpora come from the news do-
main (CNN-DailyMail, New York Times, DUC), 
personal narratives domain (Reddit), workplace 
meetings (AMI), and medical journal articles 
(PubMed). See Table 1 for dataset statistics. 

CNN-DailyMail We use the preprocessing and 
training, validation, and test splits of See et al. 
(2017). This corpus is a mix of news on differ-
ent topics including politics, sports, and entertain-
ment. 

New York Times The New York Times (NYT) 
corpus (Sandhaus, 2008) contains two types of ab-
stracts for a subset of its articles. The first sum-
mary is an archival abstract and the second is a 
shorter online teaser meant to entice a viewer of 
the webpage to click to read more. From this col-
lection, we take all articles that have a concate-
nated summary length of at least 100 words. We 
create training, validation, and test splits by parti-
tioning on dates; we use the year 2005 as the val-
idation data, with training and test partitions in-
cluding documents before and after 2005 respec-
tively. 

DUC We use the single document summariza-
tion data from the 2001 and 2002 Document 
Understanding Conferences (DUC) (Over and 
Liggett, 2002). We split the 2001 data into train-
ing and validation splits and reserve the 2002 data 
for testing. 

AMI The AMI corpus (Carletta et al., 2005) is a 
collection of real and staged office meetings anno-
tated with text transcriptions, along with abstrac-
tive summaries. We use the prescribed splits. </table></figure>

Reddit Ouyang et al. (2017) collected a corpus 
of personal stories shared on Reddit 5 along with 
multiple extractive and abstractive summaries. We 
randomly split this data using roughly three and 
five percent of the data validation and test respec-
