<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>State-of-the-art models for joint entity recognition and relation extraction strongly rely on external natural language processing (NLP) tools such as POS (part-of-speech) taggers and dependency parsers. Thus, the performance of such joint models depends on the quality of the features obtained from these NLP tools. However, these features are not always accurate for various languages and contexts. In this paper, we propose a joint neural model which performs entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, without the need of any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool. Specifically, we model the entity recognition task using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layer and the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem (i.e., potentially identify multiple relations for each entity). We present an extensive experimental setup, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using datasets from various contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch). Our model outperforms the previous neural models that use automatically extracted features, while it performs within a reasonable margin of feature-based neural models, or even beats them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The goal of the entity recognition and relation extraction is to discover relational structures of entity mentions from unstructured texts. It is a central problem in information extraction since it is critical for tasks such as knowledge base population and question answering.</p><p>The problem is traditionally approached as two separate subtasks, namely (i) named entity recognition (NER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nadeau &amp; Sekine, 2007)</ref> and (ii) relation extraction (RE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bach &amp; Badaskar, 2007)</ref>, in a pipeline setting. The main limitations of the pipeline models are: (i) error propagation between the components (i.e., NER and RE) and (ii) possible useful information from the one task is not exploited by the other (e.g., identifying a Works for relation might be helpful for the NER module in detecting the type of the two entities, i.e., PER, ORG and vice versa). On the other hand, more recent studies propose to use joint models to detect entities and their relations overcoming the aforementioned issues and achieving state-of-the-art performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Li &amp; Ji, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miwa &amp; Sasaki, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The previous joint models heavily rely on hand-crafted features. Recent advances in neural networks alleviate the issue of manual feature engineering, but some of them still depend on NLP tools (e.g., POS taggers, dependency parsers). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based joint model that uses a bidirectional sequential LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) to model the entities and a tree-LSTM that takes into account dependency tree information to model the relations between the entities. The dependency information is extracted using an external dependency parser. Similarly, in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2017)</ref> for entity and relation extraction from biomedical text, a model which also uses tree-LSTMs is applied to extract dependency information. <ref type="bibr">Gupta et al. (2016)</ref> propose a method that relies on RNNs but uses a lot of hand-crafted features and additional NLP tools to extract features such as POS-tags, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adel &amp; Schütze (2017)</ref> replicate the context around the entities with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Note that the aforementioned works examine pairs of entities for relation extraction, rather than modeling the whole sentence directly. This means that relations of other pairs of entities in the same sentence -which could be helpful in deciding on the relation type for a particular pair -are not taken into account. <ref type="bibr">Katiyar &amp; Cardie (2017)</ref> propose a neural joint model based on LSTMs where they model the whole sentence at once, but still they do not have a principled way to deal with multiple relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al. (2018)</ref> introduce a quadratic scoring layer to model the two tasks simultaneously. The limitation of this approach is that only a single relation can be assigned to a token, while the time complexity for the entity recognition task is increased compared to the standard approaches with linear complexity.</p><p>In this work, we focus on a new general purpose joint model that performs the two tasks of entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, and that can handle multiple relations together. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in a number of different contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch) without relying on any manually engineered features nor additional NLP tools. In summary, our proposed model (which will be detailed next in Section 3) solves several shortcomings that we identified in related works (Section 2) for joint entity recognition and relation extraction: (i) our model does not rely on external NLP tools nor hand-crafted features, (ii) entities and relations within the same text fragment (typically a sentence) are extracted simultaneously, where (iii) an entity can be involved in multiple relations at once. Specifically, the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> depends on dependency parsers, which perform particularly well on specific languages (i.e., English) and contexts (i.e., news). Yet, our ambition is to develop a model that generalizes well in various setups, therefore using only automatically extracted features that are learned during training.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2017)</ref> use exactly the same model in different contexts, i.e., news (ACE04) and biomedical data (ADE), respectively. Comparing our results to the ADE dataset, we obtain a 1.8% improvement on the NER task and ∼3% on the RE task. On the other hand, our model performs within a reasonable margin (∼0.6% in the NER task and ∼1% on the RE task) on the ACE04 dataset without the use of pre-calculated features. This shows that the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> strongly relies on the features extracted by the dependency parsers and cannot generalize well into different contexts where dependency parser features are weak.</p><p>Comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adel &amp; Schütze (2017)</ref>, we train our model by modeling all the entities and the relations of the sentence at once. This type of inference is beneficial in obtaining information about neighboring entities and relations instead of just examining a pair of entities each time. Finally, we solve the underlying problem of the models proposed by <ref type="bibr">Katiyar &amp; Cardie (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bekoulis et al. (2017)</ref>, who essentially assume classes (i.e., relations) to be mutually exclusive: we solve this by phrasing the relation extraction component as a multi-label prediction problem. 1</p><p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the largest experimental evaluation to date (to the best of our knowledge) in jointly performing both entity recognition and relation extraction (see Section 4 and Section 5), using different datasets from various domains (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch). Specifically, we apply our method to four datasets, namely ACE04 (news), Adverse Drug Events (ADE), Dutch Real Estate Classifieds <ref type="bibr">(DREC)</ref> and CoNLL'04 (news). Our method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods that do not rely on any additional features or tools, while performance is very close (or even better in the biomedical dataset) compared to methods that do exploit hand-engineered features or NLP tools.</p></div>

Thus, they do not simultaneously infer other potential entities and relations within the same sentence. Katiyar &amp; Cardie (2017) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al. (2018)</ref> investigate RNNs with attention for extracting relations between entity mentions without using any dependency parse tree features. Different from <ref type="bibr">Katiyar &amp; Cardie (2017)</ref>, in this work, we frame the problem as a multi-head selection problem by using a sigmoid loss to obtain multiple relations and a CRF loss for the NER component. This way, we are able to independently predict classes that are not mutually exclusive, instead of assigning equal probability values among the tokens. We overcome the issue of addi-   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 1</ref>: The multi-head selection model for joint entity and relation extraction.

Then the CRF and the sigmoid layers are able to produce the outputs for the two tasks. The outputs for each token (e.g., Smith) are: (i) an entity recognition label (e.g., I-PER) and (ii) a set of tuples comprising the head tokens of the entity and the types of relations between them (e.g., {(Center, Works for), (Atlanta, Lives in)}).</p><p>tional complexity described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Joint model</head><p>In this section, we present our multi-head joint model illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1</ref>. The model is able to simultaneously identify the entities (i.e., types and boundaries) and all the possible relations between them at once. We formulate the problem as a multi-head selection problem extending previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al., 2018)</ref> as described in Section 2.3. By multi-head, we mean that any particular entity may be the CoNLL04 dataset is presented. The input of our model is a sequence of tokens (i.e., words of the sentence) which are then represented as word vectors (i.e., word embeddings). The BiLSTM layer is able to extract a more complex representation for each word that incorporates the context via the RNN structure. Then the CRF and the sigmoid layers are able to produce the outputs for the two tasks. The outputs for each token (e.g., Smith) are twofold: (i) an entity recognition label (e.g., I-PER, denoting the token is inside a named entity of type PER) and (ii) a set of tuples comprising the head tokens of the entity and the types of relations between them (e.g., {(Center, Works for), (Atlanta, Lives in)}). Since we assume token-based encoding, we consider only the last token of the entity as head of another token, eliminating redundant relations.</p><p>For instance, there is a Works for relation between entities "John Smith" and "Disease Control Center". Instead of connecting all tokens of the entities, we connect only "Smith" with "Center". Also, for the case of no relation, we introduce the "N" label and we predict the token itself as the head.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Embedding layer</head><p>Given a sentence w = w 1 , ..., w n as a sequence of tokens, the word embedding layer is responsible to map each token to a word vector (w word2vec ). We use pre-trained word embeddings using the Skip-Gram word2vec model .</p><p>In this work, we also use character embeddings since they are commonly applied to neural NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ma &amp; Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al., 2016)</ref>. This type of embeddings is able to capture morphological features such as prefixes and suffixes. For instance, in the Adverse Drug Events (ADE) dataset, the suffix "toxicity" can specify an adverse drug event entity such as "neurotoxicity" or "hepatotoxicity" and thus it is very informative. Another example might be the Dutch suffix "kamer" ("room" in English) in the Dutch Real Estate Classifieds (DREC) dataset which is used to specify the space entities "badkamer" ("bathroom" in English) and "slaapkamer" ("bedroom" in English).</p><p>Character-level embeddings are learned during training, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ma &amp; Hovy (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al. (2016)</ref>. In the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al. (2016)</ref>, character embeddings lead to a performance improvement of up to 3% in terms of NER F 1 score. In our work, by incorporating character embeddings, we report in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> an increase of ∼2% overall F 1 scoring points.

In this work, we use multi-layer LSTMs, a specific kind of RNNs which are able to capture long term dependencies well <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bengio et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pascanu et al., 2013)</ref>. We employ a BiLSTM which is able to encode information from left to right (past to future) and right to left (future to past). This way, we can combine bidirectional information for each word by concatenating the forward ( h i ) and the backward ( h i ) output at timestep i. The BiLSTM output at timestep i can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h i = [ h i ; h i ], i = 0, ..., n<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Named entity recognition</head><p>We formulate the entity identification task as a sequence labeling problem, similar to previous work on joint learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Miwa &amp; Bansal, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Katiyar &amp; Cardie, 2017)</ref> and named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ma &amp; Hovy, 2016)</ref> using the BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) encoding scheme. Each entity consists of multiple sequential tokens within the sentence and we should assign a tag for every token in the sentence. That way we are able to identify the entity arguments (start and end position) and its type (e.g., ORG). To do so, we assign the B-type (beginning) to the first token of the entity, the I-type (inside) to every other token within the entity and the O tag (outside) if a token is not part of an entity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1</ref> shows an example of the BIO encoding tags assigned to the tokens of the sentence. In the CRF layer, one can observe that we assign the B-ORG and I-ORG tags to indicate the beginning and the inside tokens of the entity "Disease Control Center", respectively. On top of the BiLSTM layer, we employ either a softmax or a CRF layer to calculate the most probable entity tag for each token. We calculate the score of each token w i for each entity tag:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s (e) (h i ) = V (e) f (U (e) h i + b (e) )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the superscript (e) is used for the notation of the NER task, f (·) is an elementwise activation function (i.e., relu, tanh),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V (e) ∈ R p×l , U (e) ∈ R l×2d , b (e) ∈ R l ,</formula><p>with d as the hidden size of the LSTM, p the number of NER tags (e.g., B-ORG) and</p><p>l the layer width. We calculate the probabilities of all the candidate tags for a given</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">token w i as Pr(tag | w i ) = softmax(s(h i )) where Pr(tag | w i ) ∈ R p .</formula><p>In this work, we employ the softmax approach only for the entity classification (EC) task (which is similar to NER) where we need to predict only the entity types (e.g., PER) for each token assuming boundaries are given. The CRF approach is used for the NER task which includes both entity type and boundaries recognition.</p><p>In the softmax approach, we assign entity types to tokens in a greedy way at prediction time (i.e., the selected tag is just the highest scoring tag over all possible set of tags). Although assuming an independent tag distribution is beneficial for entity classification tasks (e.g., POS tagging), this is not the case when there are strong de-pendencies between the tags. Specifically, in NER, the BIO tagging scheme forces several restrictions (e.g., B-LOC cannot be followed by I-PER). The softmax method allows local decisions (i.e., for the tag of each token w i ) even though the BiLSTM captures information about the neighboring words. Still, the neighboring tags are not taken into account for the tag decision of a specific token. For example, in the entity "John Smith", tagging "Smith" as PER is useful for deciding that "John" is B-PER. To this end, for NER, we use a linear-chain CRF, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al. (2016)</ref> where an improvement of ∼1% F 1 NER points is reported when using CRF.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Relation extraction as multi-head selection</head><p>In this subsection, we describe the relation extraction task, formulated as a multi-head selection problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al., 2018)</ref>. In the general formulation of our method, each token w i can have multiple heads (i.e., multiple relations with other tokens). We predict the tuple (ŷ i ,ĉ i ) whereŷ i is the vector of heads andĉ i is the vector of the corresponding relations for each token w i . This is different for the previous standard head selection for dependency parsing method  since (i) it is extended to predict multiple heads and (ii) the decisions for the heads and the relations are jointly taken (i.e., instead of first predicting the heads and then in a next step the relations by using an additional classifier). Given as input a token sequence w and a set of relation labels R, our goal is to identify for each token w i , i ∈ {0, ..., n} the vector of the most probable headsŷ i ⊆ w and the vector of the most probable corresponding relation labelsr i ⊆ R. We calculate the score between tokens w i and w j given a label r k as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s (r) (z j , z i , r k ) = V (r) f (U (r) z j + W (r) z i + b (r) )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the superscript (r) is used for the notation of the relation task, f (·) is an elementwise activation function (i.e., relu, tanh),</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V (r) ∈ R l , U (r) ∈ R l×(2d+b) , W (r) ∈ R l×(2d+b) , b (r) ∈ R l , d</formula><p>is the hidden size of the LSTM, b is the size of the label embeddings and l the layer width. We define</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pr(head = w j , label = r k | w i ) = σ(s (r) (z j , z i , r k ))<label>(7)</label></formula><p>to be the probability of token w j to be selected as the head of token w i with the relation label r k between them, where σ(.) stands for the sigmoid function. We minimize the cross-entropy loss L rel during training:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L rel = n i=0 m j=0 − log Pr(head = y i,j , relation = r i,j | w i )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where y i ⊆ w and r i ⊆ R are the ground truth vectors of heads and associated relation labels of w i and m is the number of relations (heads) for w i . After training, we keep the combination of headsŷ i and relation labelsr i exceeding a threshold based on the estimated joint probability as defined in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(7)</ref>. Unlike previous work on joint models (Katiyar &amp; Cardie, 2017), we are able to predict multiple relations considering the classes as independent and not mutually exclusive (the probabilities do not necessarily sum to 1 for different classes). For the joint entity and relation extraction task, we calculate the final objective as L NER + L rel .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Results</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref>, we present the results of our analysis. The first column indicates the considered dataset. In the second column, we denote the model which is applied (i.e., previous work and the proposed models). The proposed models are the following:</p><p>(i) multi-head is the proposed model with the CRF layer for NER and the sigmoid loss for multiple head prediction, (ii) multi-head+E is the proposed model with addition of Edmonds' algorithm to guarantee a tree-structured output for the DREC dataset, (iii) single-head is the proposed method but it predicts only one head per token using a softmax loss instead of a sigmoid, and (iv) multi-head EC is the proposed method with a softmax to predict the entity classes assuming that the boundaries are given, and the sigmoid loss for multiple head selection. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> also indicates whether the different settings include hand-crafted features or features derived from NLP tools (e.g., POS taggers, dependency parsers). We use the symbol to denote that the model includes this kind of additional features and the symbol to denote that the model is only based on automatically extracted features. Note that all the variations of our model do not rely on any additional features. In the next column, we declare the type of evaluation conducted for each experiment. We include here different evaluation types to be able to compare our results against previous studies. Specifically, we use three evaluation types, namely: (iii) Relaxed: we score a multi-token entity as correct if at least one of its comprising token types is correct assuming that the boundaries are given; a relation is correct when the type of the relation and the argument entities are both correct.</p><p>In the next three columns, we present the results for the entity identification task (Precision, Recall, F 1 ) and then (in the subsequent three columns) the results of the relation extraction task (Precision, Recall, F 1 ). Finally, in the last column, we report an additional F 1 measure which is the average F 1 performance of the two subtasks. We mark with bold font in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref>  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2017)</ref>, the class probabilities do not necessarily sum up to one since the classes are considered independent. Moreover, we use a CRF-layer to model the NER task to capture dependencies between sequential tokens. Finally, we obtain more effective word representations by using character-level embeddings. On the other hand, our model performs within a reasonable margin (∼0.5% for the NER task and ∼1%</p><p>for the RE task) compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref>. This difference is explained by the fact that the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> relies on POS tagging and syntactic features derived by dependency parsing. However, this kind of features relies on NLP tools that are not always accurate for various languages and contexts. For instance, the same model is adopted by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2017)</ref> for the ADE biomedical dataset and in this dataset our model reports more than 3% improvement in the RE task. This shows that our model is able to produce automatically extracted features which perform reasonably well in all contexts (e.g., news, biomedical).</p><p>For the CoNLL04 dataset, there are two different evaluation settings, namely relaxed and strict. In the relaxed setting, we perform an EC task instead of NER assuming that the boundaries of the entities are given. We adopt this setting to produce comparable results with previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Gupta et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adel &amp; Schütze, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adel &amp; Schütze (2017)</ref>, we present results of single models and no ensembles. We observe that our model outperforms all previous models that do not rely on complex hand-crafted features by a large margin (&gt;4% for both tasks). Unlike these previous studies that consider pairs of entities to obtain the entity types and the corresponding relations, we model the whole sentence at once. That way, our method is able to directly infer all entities and relations of a sentence and benefit from their possible interactions that cannot be modeled when training is performed for each entity pair individually, one at a time. In the same setting, we also report the results of Gupta et al. <ref type="bibr">(2016)</ref> in which they use multiple complicated hand-crafted features coming from NLP tools. Our model performs slightly better for the EC task and within a margin of 1% in terms of overall F 1 score. The difference in the overall performance is due to the fact that our model uses only automatically generated features. We also report re-sults on the same dataset conducting NER (i.e., predicting entity types and boundaries) and evaluating using the strict evaluation measure, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miwa &amp; Sasaki (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our results are not directly comparable to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miwa &amp; Sasaki (2014)</ref> because we use the splits provided by <ref type="bibr">Gupta et al. (2016)</ref>. However, in this setting we present the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miwa &amp; Sasaki (2014)</ref> as reference. We report an improvement of ∼2% overall F 1 score, which suggests that our neural model is able to extract more informative representations compared to feature-based approaches.</p><p>We also report results for the DREC dataset, with two different evaluation settings.</p><p>Specifically, we use the boundaries and the strict settings. We transform the previous results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bekoulis et al. (2018)</ref> to the boundaries setting to make them comparable to our model since in their work, they report token-based F 1 score, which is not a common evaluation metric in relation extraction problems. Also, in their work, they focus on identifying only the boundaries of the entities and not the types (e.g., Floor, Space). In the boundaries evaluation, we achieve ∼3% improvement for both tasks.</p><p>This is due to the fact that their quadratic scoring layer is beneficial for the RE task, yet complicates NER, which is usually modeled as a sequence labeling task. Moreover, we report results using the strict evaluation which is used in most related works. Using the prior knowledge that each entity has only one head, we can simplify our model and predict only one head each time (i.e., using a softmax loss). The difference between the single and the multi-head models is marginal (&lt;0.1% for both tasks). This shows that our model (multi-head) can adapt to various environments, even if the setting is single head (in terms of the application, and thus also in both training and test data).</p><p>Finally, we compare our model with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al., , 2017</ref> on the ADE dataset. The previous models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al., , 2017</ref> both use hand-crafted features or features derived from NLP tools. However, our model is able to outperform both models using the strict evaluation metric. We report an improvement of ∼2% in the NER and ∼3% in the RE tasks, respectively. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al. (2017)</ref> is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016)</ref> and strongly relies on dependency parsers to extract syntactic information. A possible explanation for the better result obtained from our model is that the pre-calculated syntactic information obtained using external tools either is not so accurate or important for biomedical data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Analysis of feature contribution</head><p>We conduct ablation tests on the ACE04 dataset reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> to analyze the effectiveness of the various parts of our joint model. The performance of the RE task decreases (∼1% in terms of F 1 score) when we remove the label embeddings layer and only use the LSTM hidden states as inputs for the RE task. This shows that the NER labels, as expected, provide meaningful information for the RE component.</p><p>Removing character embeddings also degrades the performance of both NER (∼1%) and RE (∼2%) tasks by a relatively large margin. This illustrates that composing words by the representation of characters is effective, and our method benefits from additional information such as capital letters, suffixes and prefixes within the token (i.e., its character sequences).</p><p>Finally, we conduct experiments for the NER task by removing the CRF loss layer and substituting it with a softmax. Assuming independent distribution of labels (i.e., softmax) leads to a slight decrease in the F 1 performance of the NER module and a ∼2% decrease in the performance of the RE task. This happens because the CRF loss is able to capture the strong tag dependencies (e.g., I-LOC cannot follow B-PER) that are present in the dataset instead of just assuming that the tag decision for each token is independent from tag decisions of neighboring tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we present a joint neural model to simultaneously extract entities and relations from textual data. Our model comprises a CRF layer for the entity recognition task and a sigmoid layer for the relation extraction task. Specifically, we model the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem since one entity can have multiple relations. Previous models on this task rely heavily on external NLP tools (i.e., POS taggers, dependency parsers). Thus, the performance of these models is affected by the accuracy of the extracted features. Unlike previous studies, our model produces automatically generated features rather than relying on hand-crafted ones, or existing NLP tools. Given its independence from such NLP or other feature generating tools, our approach can be easily adopted for any language and context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting a large scale experimental study. Our model is able to outperform neural methods that automatically generate features while the results are marginally similar (or sometimes better) compared to feature-based neural network approaches.</p><p>As future work, we aim to explore the effectiveness of entity pre-training for the entity recognition module. This approach has been proven beneficial in the work of Miwa &amp; Bansal (2016) for both the entity and the relation extraction modules. In addition, we are planning to explore a way to reduce the calculations in the quadratic relation scoring layer. For instance, a straightforward way to do so is to use in the sigmoid layer only the tokens that have been identified as entities.</p><p>Gupta, P., <ref type="bibr">Schütze, H., &amp; Andrassy, B. (2016)</ref>. In this section, we report additional results for our multi-head selection framework.</p><p>Specifically, we (i) compare our model with the model of <ref type="bibr">Lample et al. (2016) (i.e.,</ref> optimize only over the NER task), (ii) explore several hyperparameters of the network (e.g., dropout, LSTM size, character embeddings size), and (iii) report F 1 score using different word embeddings compared to the embeddings used in previous works.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref> of the main paper, we focused on comparing our model against other joint models that are able to solve the two tasks (i.e., NER and relation extraction) simultaneously, mainly demonstrating superiority of phrasing the relation extraction as a multi-head selection problem (enabling the extraction of multiple relations at once).</p><p>Here, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table A1,</ref>  (2016) on the CoNLL-2003 test set is 0.01% and 0.17% F 1 points, respectively). This slight improvement suggests that the interaction of the two components by sharing the underlying LSTM layer is indeed beneficial (e.g., identifying a Works for relation might be helpful for the NER module in detecting the type of the two entities, i.e., PER, ORG and vice versa). Note that improving NER in isolation was not the objective of our multi-head model, but we rather aimed to compare our model against other joint models that solve the task of entity recognition and relation identification simultaneously.</p><p>We thus did not envision to claim or achieve state-of-the-art performance in each of the individual building blocks of our joint model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables A2, A3</ref> and A4 show the performance of our model on the test set for different values of the embedding dropout, LSTM layer dropout and the LSTM output dropout hyperparameters, respectively. Note that the hyperparameter values used for the results in Section 5 were obtained by tuning over the development set, and these are indicated in bold face in the tables below. We vary one hyperparameter at a time in order to assess the effect of a particular hyperparameter. The main outcomes from these tables are twofold: (i) low dropout values (e.g., 0, 0.1) lead to a performance decrease in the overall F 1 score (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table A3</ref> where a ∼3% F 1 decrease is reported on the ACE04 dataset) and (ii) average dropout values (i.e., 0.2-0.4) lead to consistently similar results.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Tables A5, A6</ref>  In the main results (see Section 5), to guarantee a fair comparison to previous work and to obtain comparable results that are not affected by the input embeddings, we use embeddings used also in prior studies. To assess the performance of our system to input       variations, we also report results using different word embeddings (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table A9</ref>) (i.e.,</p><p>Adel &amp; Schütze (2017); Li et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2017)</ref>) on the ACE04 dataset.

The reported results show that different hyperparameters settings do lead to noticeable performance differences, but we do not observe any clear trend. Moreover, we have not observed any significant performance improvement that affects the overall ranking of the models as reported inTable 1. On the other hand, the results indicate that increasing (character and label) embedding size and layer dimensions leads to a slight decrease in performance for the CoNLL04 dataset. This can be explained by the fact that the CoNLL04 dataset is relatively small and using more trainable model parameters (i.e., larger hyperparameter values) can make our multi-head selection method to overfit quickly on the training set. In almost any other case, variation of the hyperparameters does not affect the ranking of the models reported inTable 1.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Entity</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Model</cell><cell>P</cell><cell>R</cell><cell>F1</cell></row><row><cell>ACE</cell><cell>NER baseline</cell><cell>81.06</cell><cell>81.13</cell><cell>81.10</cell></row><row><cell>04</cell><cell>multi-head</cell><cell>81.01</cell><cell>81.31</cell><cell>81.16</cell></row><row><cell>CoNLL</cell><cell>NER baseline</cell><cell>84.38</cell><cell>83.13</cell><cell>83.75</cell></row><row><cell>04</cell><cell>multi-head</cell><cell>83.75</cell><cell>84.06</cell><cell>83.90</cell></row><row><cell>DREC</cell><cell>NER baseline multi-head</cell><cell>78.22 78.97</cell><cell>84.89 83.98</cell><cell>81.42 81.39</cell></row><row><cell>ADE</cell><cell>NER baseline multi-head</cell><cell>83.97 84.72</cell><cell>88.59 88.16</cell><cell>86.22 86.40</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
