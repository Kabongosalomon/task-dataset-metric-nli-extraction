				<p>Temporal expressions are words or phrases that describe a point, duration or recurrence in time. Automatically annotating these expressions is a research goal of increasing interest. Recognising them can be achieved with supervised machine learning, but interpreting them accurately (normalisation) is a complex task requiring human knowledge. In this paper, we present TIMEN, a community-driven tool for temporal expression normalisation. TIMEN is derived from current best approaches and is an independent tool, enabling easy integration in existing systems. We argue that temporal expression normalisation can only be effectively performed with a large knowledge base and set of rules. Our solution is a framework and system with which to capture this knowledge for different languages. Using both existing and newly-annotated data, we present results showing competitive performance and invite the IE community to contribute to the resource in order to solve the temporal expression normalisation problem.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper addresses temporal expression processing in natural language, which is framed in the field of information extraction (IE). We present an open, extensible and state-of-the-art temporal normalisation library TIMEN (http://www.timen.org/), that improves upon all other publicly available system performances. A temporal expression (or timex) is a linguistic expression referring to a time, period, or recurring pattern in time (for example "May 2012", "next month", "3 hours", "weekly"). Timex annotation involves the recognition of these expressions and then their interpretation, resulting in an annotation encoding a standardised representation of the timex's semantics, e.g. an ISO 8601 compliant specification of a calendrical time. This interpretation task is called timex normalisation. The comprehension of temporal expressions is critical to accurate processing of discourse semantics. Achieving this has been a long-standing research task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Mani and Wilson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Verhagen et al., 2010)</ref>. Aside from its intrinsic importance for discourse understanding, understanding temporal information is crucial for language processing applications including question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Saquete et al., 2009</ref>), text summarisation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Daniel et al., 2003)</ref>, information retrieval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alonso et al., 2007</ref>) and knowledge base population <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ji et al., 2011</ref>). Timexes can be recognised using machine learning and has been achieved with relatively simple feature sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Llorens et al., 2011</ref>). However, any practical approach to timex normalisation requires a hand-crafted rule set. The scale of annotated data and intelligent reasoning required to automatically infer, for example, the rules about the date of Easter Sunday or the associations between hemispheres and seasons from just text is too great to be practically feasible.</p><p>Previous approaches to timex normalisation have included their own custom rule sets and typically reach 60%-90% accuracy depending on evaluation dataset. Scant efforts have been made to build upon prior systems' performance. Instead, each system has incorporated a new, unique built-in rule set that captures the majority of timexes for a given training set that arise from a limited range of phrase types. This performance cap demonstrates the inherent disadvantages of rule-based approaches. Neither closed, integrated nor proprietary rule bases are equipped to normalise unseen timexes, or to grow in order to handle them. Further, much of the normalisation effort is inherently languageindependent, working with structures such as calendars and simple temporal constructs such as month and day names. Separating the logic for dealing with this from language-specific requirements enables effective normalisation across languages. Finally, the limited amount of temporally annotated training data and its restriction to the newswire genre suggest that the real accuracy rate of existing systems will be lower than their evaluation indicates. In light of this, our overall research question is: How can we reach 100% normalisation accuracy in timex interpretation? 1 Towards this goal, the questions we address in this paper are:</p><p>1. How can we create a high-performance multi-lingual timex normalisation system? E.g. how will we normalise timexes to improve upon prior work? 2. How can a normalisation system be made permanent, reusable and extensible? That is, what features must such system have so that it can grow over time?</p><p>To <ref type="table">address the first we propose an approach involving hand- crafted rules and a rule processing engine. This builds on  various rule sets extracted or intuited from previous systems  and includes an evaluation component.  In response to the second, we</ref> propose a rule creation strategy that includes a constant performance evaluation component and is driven by corpus-based failure analysis. This is openly accessible via a community editable rule base. The remainder of our paper is as follows. In Section 2., we provide descriptions of timexes according to modern standards and summarise previous approaches to timex normalisation in Section 3. We describe our system in Section 4. and present a comparative evaluation of state-of-theart timex normalisation systems with a new gold-standard corpus in Section 5. before concluding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Temporal Expressions and Normalisation</head><p>Timex processing consists of recognising temporal expressions in text, as well as classifying and normalising them.</p><p>The normalisation subtask consists of obtaining the absolute value of a timex regardless of the linguistic expression used. Example 1 shows the normalisation of two timexes.</p><p>(1) a. He was born in June 19831983−06. b. He was born in 06/19831983−06.</p><p>The timexes underlined in (1a) and (1b) normalise to the same value . All semantically equivalent timexes encode to the same value. Currently, the standard temporal annotation scheme is TimeML 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pustejovsky et al., 2003a</ref>), which includes a specification of the TIMEX3 standard. According to this scheme, the normalised value of a timex is commonly expressed in one of the following notations: (i) a Gregorian calendar time or date formatted in the ISO 8601 standard as in (2a), or (ii) a period formatted as P, a number and an abbreviated temporal unit as in (2b).</p><p>(2) a. October 2012: 2012-10 b. Two weeks: P2W</p><p>The complexity of the task comes from the variability of language for expressing time and also the fact that there are timexes whose accurate interpretation depends on other contextual and linguistic features -see Example (3). In (3a), we need the utterance or document creation time (DCT) and the tense to obtain the normalised value. In (3b), we need to refer to a previously-mentioned temporal expression to perform normalisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Timex Normalisation Taxonomy</head><p>Establishing a taxonomy of timexes is a useful first step in a "divide and conquer" approach to the normalisation problem. Most analyses agree that timexes can be:</p><p>• Explicit, absolute, or self-contained: These can be directly translated to a particular granularity date/time.</p><p>• Implicit, relative, or context-dependent: These need the document creation time (deictic) or a previously mentioned temporal reference/anchoring (anaphoric) to obtain a explicit date/time.</p><p>• Durative: Describing a bounded interval (or duration) that is not inherently anchored to a timeline.</p><p>• Set or frequency: Regularly recurring times, such as "every Christmas" or "each Tuesday".</p><p>• Vague: generic mentions like "recently" or "today" in "today's fashions"; see TIDES standard Section 4.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ferro et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>The information and reasoning required to type and interpret temporal expressions is complex. One must rely on contextual clues, world knowledge and discourse anaphora in order to correctly perform timex normalisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Previous Work</head><p>There have been many previous approaches to the timex normalisation task. We first describe early systems which laid the foundation for timex normalisation, and then stateof-the-art systems focusing on those involved in the last international evaluation, TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al., 2010).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Pre-TIMEX3</head><p>One of the first relevant approaches to the normalisation task was <ref type="bibr">TempEx (Mani and Wilson, 2000</ref>) later extended and released as GUTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Verhagen et al., 2005</ref>). This was an early approach to the robust temporal processing of news. It defined an annotation scheme and a system to recognise and normalise timexes, excluding durations (e.g., "two years"), generics (e.g., "today's youth") and fuzzy expressions (e.g., "in a few hours"). Its normalisation component distinguished explicit (self-contained or SC) and implicit (context-dependent or DP) timexes. Furthermore, within the implicit ones they differentiated those relative to the DCT and those relative to a previously mentioned timex (temporal focus). For normalising, the system used the following features relative to a timex: words, the reference time (DCT or focus) and governing tense.</p><p>In the TERN 2004 evaluation, the Chronos system <ref type="bibr">(Ne- gri and Marseglia, 2004</ref>) reached the highest performance. This system followed the TIMEX2 3 annotation guidelines. Similar to GUTime, the approach differentiated absolute and relative timexes. Again, these were divided into those relative to DCT and those relative to a previous temporal reference. TERSEO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Saquete et al., 2006</ref>) is a later TIMEX2 system that improves upon Chronos. It accounts for period and fuzzy expressions. The system includes a FOL-based rule syntax and a method to automatically extend rules to other languages. DANTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mazur and Dale, 2007</ref>) also uses rules and follows TIMEX2. The differentiation of underspecified timexes and the definition of their local semantics is the main contribution of this work. TimexTag ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahn et al., 2005</ref>) is another rule-based approach to normalisation which follows TIMEX2 specifications. This defines a taxonomy consisting of points, which includes explicit, deictic (relative to DCT) and anaphoric (relative to previous reference) timexes, durations, vague points (e.g., "in the past") and recurrences (e.g., "each Sunday"). TEA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Han et al., 2006</ref>) uses rules but follows the recent TIMEX3 standard. Both TimexTag and TEA rely on hierarchical constraint satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">State of the art</head><p>Recently, systems have focused on the TIMEX3 standard, which was also used in TempEval-2. The best systems in the normalisation task were rule-based.</p><p>HeidelTime <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2010</ref>) performed recognition and normalisation with rules, and catered for explicit, durative, implicit (relative to DCT) and relative timexes.</p><p>Its regex-based rules use an internal symbol set encoding for temporal concepts such as months and calendar events. This system had the best normalisation performance over the TempEval-2 expressions that it recognised (85%). TRIPS/TRIOS (UzZaman and Allen, 2010) had a datadriven recognition component, with rule-based timex typing and normalisation. TIPSem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Llorens et al., 2010</ref>) implemented a hybrid strategy for normalisation. Firstly a learned classifier determines the normalisation type (explicit, relative to DCT, relative to previous reference, duration, set or vague). Then, handcrafted rules based on pattern matching are applied depending on normalisation type. Finally, although not part of the TempEval-2 exercise, TERNIP (Northwood, 2010) is a modern reimplementation of GUTime, using a system-independent rule base and sophisticated syntax. From the described systems, the following are publicly available and will work with TIMEX3-annotated TimeML: TERNIP 4 (based on GUTime), TIPSem 5 and HeidelTime 6 . Therefore, these are the systems to which we will compare TIMEN (see Section 5.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TIMEN Overview</head><p>We introduce our approach in this section. The overall operation of TIMEN is as follows. Firstly, the timex phrase to be normalised is selected together with some contextual information. Next this is converted into a symbolic representation using a knowledge base (KB). Rules are then matched against the representation. Finally, a normalised output is produced in TIMEX3 format. The distinguishing characteristics of TIMEN are independence from other timex processing tasks, an open philosophy and multilinguality. Its architecture clearly separates: (i) the algorithms (source code) which conduct the task and (ii) the knowledge and rules necessary for the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">TIMEN Library</head><p>We developed TIMEN as a resource that outputs a timex's normalised value given a timex, a set of features (a DCT, a time ref and a tense) and an input language. The architecture is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. To obtain the normalised value To better explain the processing flow of TIMEN, we describe the steps below using an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Input Data</head><p>Suppose that we run TIMEN with the following input data: timex is October 25, DCT is 2012-02-02, the tense is past and the language is English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Symbolic Representation</head><p>Firstly, TIMEN parses the timex using the English KB (see Section 4.3.) to obtain a normalised text (normtext) and a pattern, which is the original text with certain phrasessuch as weekday names -converted to language independent symbols. The pattern is used to match rules in the rulebase, and the normtext is used to obtain the final normalised value from a simplified text (e.g., always in lower case, spelled numbers are translated to numbers, tokenisation where is the separator). Example: For October 25, the pattern is TMonth Num. This would be the same for any month followed by a number (e.g., Mar 1999). For October 25, the normtext is october 25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">Rule Matching</head><p>The next step is querying the rulebase with the pattern obtained. In cases where multiple rules match, TIMEN follows a disambiguation process. This consists of checking in order if the found rules have conditions and if so checking whether normtext matches them. The first rule found that matches the conditions (or does not have conditions) is applied.</p><p>Example:</p><p>In the current TIMEN rulebase, we find two rules for TMonth Num. The first one refers to a month followed by a day and has the condition TOKEN(1)&lt;32, which means that the word in position 1 (starting at 0) of normtext is a number and it is lower than 32. The second one refers to a month followed by a year and has no conditions. Since the rules are stored and retrieved in order of priorty, the first one will be always checked before the second.</p><p>For october 25, the condition of the first rule is matched.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIMEN applies the rule's expression -DATE MONTH DAY(DCT,TOKEN(0),TOKEN(1)) -to obtain the TIMEX3 normalisation of a month followed by a day, by use of a built-in function (DATE MONTH DAY).</head><p>Below in the subsection dedicated to the knowledgebase and the rulebase (4.3.) we further explain the elements of the patterns and the syntax of the rules 7 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">TIMEX3 Output</head><p>In order to apply the matched rule TIMEN will use the symbolic representation of the input text and the supplied input features. Example: Information required at this point is tense, DCT and the values october and 25. In this case, since the tense is past and the DCT is set to 2nd of February 2012, the normalised output will be 2011-10-25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5.">Discourse Management</head><p>Since TIMEN is just a library we need an application which uses it and handles discourse-level information and document processing. In order to give to final users an example application, we developed TIMEN CONSUMER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Exmple Application Using TIMEN</head><p>TIMEN CONSUMER is an example application developed to show how to integrate TIMEN in major projects. TIMEN CONSUMER performs timex normalisation in two basic situations:</p><p>1. There is a timex without any context (e.g., "October") and you want to know its normalised value. 2. There is a TimeML file where DCT and timexes are annotated and you want to add or update the normalisation values of the timexes.</p><p>As discussed above, a timex often cannot be normalised in isolation -contextual information such as temporal references and the tense of the verbs governing the timexes is often required. Therefore, to demonstrate the benefits of TIMEN over prior timex processing systems, we focus on the second situation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the architecture of TIMEN CONSUMER integrating the TIMEN library. TIMEN CONSUMER controls discourse-level information, saving previously normalised timexes in order to track reference time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Reichenbach, 1947)</ref> and also handling tenses which affect timexes. It takes a TimeML document containing delimited timexes as input and manages their presentation to the TIMEN library, which generates normalisations. Because TIMEN is available as a decoupled library, anyone may implement their own wrapper strategy for handling context; TIMEN CONSUMER is provided as an example, to allow rapid standalone normalisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Knowledgebase and Rulebase</head><p>TIMEN relies on external knowledge, stored as symbolic or axiomatic representations. Here we describe the management of fixed language-specific knowledge and the rule format for temporal reasoning and normalisation. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> A complete technical reference to the knowledge base and rule syntax, as well as the syntax of rule conditions, is described at http://timen.org/. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Knowledgebase Construction</head><p>The knowledgebases are simple files which contain regular expressions for different time-related expressions. For example, the knowledgebase for English has an expression for months (TMonth) as shown in example (4). TIMEN uses this knowledge to build language-independent representations from input timexes. For optimisation, the rulebases are maintained as static Java class files, automatically recompiled after modification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Rule Storage</head><p>The rulebases are SQLite databases, which contain tables of rules. Rules operate on a priority and constraintsatisfaction basis. Rules chosen for normalisation are those that match the timex's pattern, in order of priority, highest first. In the case that a rule has conditions, it can only be applied if the timex satisfies them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Rule Syntax</head><p>Some of the basic constants and functions which can be used in the rules are the following.</p><p>Constants: This are elements that are replaced by the corresponding value set at TIMEN initialisation time.</p><p>• DCT: The value of the document creation time.</p><p>• REFTIME: The value of the current reference time.</p><p>• DCTYEAR: The four-digit year of the DCT.</p><p>• DCTMONTH: The two-digit month of the DCT.</p><p>• DCTDAY: The two-digit day of the DCT.</p><p>Functions: These are elements used to calculate and print different normalisation values. Examples follow.</p><p>• "STRING": Prints any quoted text string.</p><p>• TO YEAR(number): If a number does not have four digits the missing digits are guessed taking into account DCT and tense. For example, if the tense is past and the DCT is in 2012, TO YEAR(99), this function will return 1999. If the tense is future it will return 2099 instead.</p><p>• DATE MONTH(date, month): Returns a date using the tense given a reference date and a month. For example, if the tense is future, DATE MONTH(2012-02-02,october) returns 2012-10.</p><p>• ADD(date, granularity, number): Outputs the date resulting of adding the number in the corresponding granularity. For example, ADD(2012-03-01,day,-1) equals 2012-02-29.</p><p>The complete rule syntax as well as the condition syntax is included in TIMEN documentation 8 . Note that a rule might consist of one or more constants or functions separated by the semi-colon character. Furthermore these can be combined, e.g., ADD(DCT,TOKEN(1),TOKEN(0)). To illustrate some real rules, a screen-shot of the rulebase containing some actual rule entries is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. The example rule used in Section 4.1. can be seen here. TIMEN and TIMEN CONSUMER have been made available on-line, at the TIMEN website. This website also serves as an interface for the community integration of the resource explained in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Community Integration</head><p>In this section, we describe how we manage the collaborative community-led management of TIMEN's normalisation rulebase. Our approach to timex interpretation relies on the premise that the normalisation problem can only be completely solved with some application of hand-crafted rules. A universal tool needs a hugely comprehensive rulebase; one that cannot be constructed in a short amount of time or by a small group of people. To overcome this, TIMEN's collaborative rule repository can be edited by any interested party. Modification and addition of rules must be enabled in a way that ensures quality. Each rule includes a full TIMEX3 annotation that shows a <ref type="bibr">8</ref> See http://timen.org. timex in context and also its type and value. Using this, each rule can be verified. When a rule is to be modified or added, a testing component, which is part of TIMEN, verifies the rule set and highlights failing or broken rules. We enable the community aspect of TIMEN with a website that lets users submit/modify rules, using:</p><p>• Rule ID: a numeric id for the rule.</p><p>• Rule pattern: the pattern to match.</p><p>• Rule type: the type in the taxonomy.</p><p>• Rule code: the encoded rule.</p><p>• Rule conditions: conditions if any.</p><p>• Rule priority: the importance of the rule (optional).</p><p>• Language: a two-letter language code representing which language rulebase this entry is destined for.</p><p>• Example timex: a sentence containing a TIMEX3 tag, that is normalisable using the rule. The normalised text and the annotated TIMEX3 value are compared to validate the rule's operation.</p><p>We manually moderate new rules, but they will be automatically rejected if the rule reduces performance on a predefined test set, the rule does not work for the example timex or the example can already by normalised by the existing ruleset. The process for moderating and accepting new rules is detailed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Rule priority is dealt with in more detail in the technical documentation on the TIMEN website. TIMEN also includes an update mechanism which can au-tomatically download new rulebase and knowledgebase entries into an existing installation. The website used for this process is based on Wordpress, and new rules use the "posts" mechanism, allowing us to re-use the moderation and comments facilities without building a new management system from scratch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we evaluate TIMEN using an existing dataset that is commonly used for normalisation evaluation, and using a newly created corpus which we also introduce. The evaluation of TIMEN has two primary goals: (i) measuring the performance of TIMEN itself over gold TimeML annotated data, and (ii) measuring whether or not the application of TIMEN over currently available timex processing systems leads to an improvement of their performance in normalisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Development Data</head><p>The evaluation in this section is intended to reflect results based on resources that other state-of-the-art normalisation systems have. Therefore, the development dataset consists of the TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) and AQUAINT TimeML corpora plus the TempEval-2 English training TIMEX3 annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">TIMEX3 Evaluation Datasets</head><p>There are two evaluations dataset: the TempEval-2 test dataset and a newly created dataset (TimenEval). Both TIMEN and, possibly, other existing systems, have developed their normalisation rule sets using the TempEval-2 training dataset, a part of TimeBank 1.2 corpus 9 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">New Dataset: TimenEval</head><p>For TIMEN evaluation, not only do we evaluate using a well-known prior dataset, we also create and include a new resource for timex normalisation evaluation. Most existing systems have been built using the same datasets for development -TimeBank, AQUAINT and TempEval-2. We therefore generated new data to see how the systems (including TIMEN) perform on unseen timexes. The dataset is intended to focus on diversity of both expression of time (e.g. input text) and value (normalised value). To this end, it contains a significant amount of non-newswire material. Vital statistics of the datasets are summarised in For the new dataset (TimenEval), we took care to achieve a good distribution of dates, times, durations and sets. Two annotators manually selected English test documents from the TAC KBP Source Collection <ref type="bibr">10</ref> . Annotations were validated both with the CAVaT TimeML checking tool <ref type="bibr">(Der- czynski and Gaizauskas, 2010)</ref> and also via XML Schema. TempEval-2's test data set had only 6 TIMEs and no SETtype timexes; TimenEval improves notably on both these counts <ref type="bibr">(43 TIMEs and 16 SETs)</ref>. TimenEval is available at http://www.timen.org/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">TIMEN Performance</head><p>For the first goal, we run TIMEN over the gold annotations of both the test set in the TempEval-2 evaluation and our newly created dataset. Our initial evaluation measures intrinsic normalisation accuracy using gold-standard timex annotations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the obtained results.  A priori, these results seem comparable to those obtained by the best normalisation system in TempEval-2 (e.g., HeidelTime: 0.85). However, because HeidelTime only recognised 86% of all timexes in the TempEval-2 test set, that 0.85 means that HeidelTime normalised correctly only 85% of the 86% of timexes it was exposed to. Results are not thus comparable and we can therefore only assert with full certainty that HeidelTime normalised correctly at least 0.73 (0.85 * 0.86) out of the total timexes. To conduct a fair, comparable and rigorous evaluation, we carried out the second experiment detailed below, in which each system is evaluated and combined with TIMEN to detect if TIMEN gives an improvement in the normalisation performance -which is its goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Using TIMEN with other systems</head><p>For the second goal, measuring the performance change TIMEN offers over other systems' normalisation components, we compare the performance of three other publiclyavailable state-of-the-art timex processing systems (i.e., TIPSem, TERNIP, HeidelTime); firstly with their own normalisation code's TIMEX3 values and secondly with those supplied by TIMEN. Specifically, we run these systems over a dataset and measure their own normalisation performance. Then, we substitute their normalisation component with TIMEN and re-evaluate, using their recognised timex extents as input. This is made possible by TIMEN CONSUMER's support for operation as a drop-in component that can take existing TIMEX3 annotations and overwrite only the attributes relevant to normalisation. We carried out the described evaluation over both the TempEval-2 test data and the TimenEval dataset, which, unlike the TempEval-2 dataset, can be guaranteed not to have been used to develop the evaluated systems or TIMEN. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 3 and 4</ref> show the results obtained for each dataset. Performance is scored as in TempEval-2; that is, "Extents" is the F1 measure of strict extent detection, and the normalisation scores are the percentage of correct TIMEX3 values determined for the subset of detected timexes.   Results on the TimenEval dataset are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. This evaluation treats normalisation equally, as no system has seen the dataset before. Again, TIMEN provides a visible performance boost in all cases, even over HeidelTime's normalisation. It is interesting to see an increase here, as HeidelTime uses an integrated recognition and normalisation ruleset, and might not be expected to recognise timexes that it could not normalise. TIPSemB's low results are due to the variable quality of the text in the dataset. Timex annotations are not as structured as those in TempEval-2, but instead include some noise (e.g. newline breaks in timexes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>The lack of variety in genre in existing TimeML corpora, which are all newswire, also makes it harder for existing approaches based on machine learning to recognise timexes in TimenEval. To improve recognition, re-training on informal/unformatted text is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Error analysis and discussion</head><p>Development of the gold standard dataset was hard, particularly because of variation in available standards. ISO-8601, TIDES TIMEX2 and TimeML TIMEX3 all contribute to the normalisation value format. Example cases include the treatment of negative dates, where (for historic reasons) TIDES and ISO-8601 diverge; for date delimitation, where ISO-8601 permits a variety of schemes, TIMEX2 and TIMEX3 are non-specific, but all existing tools and resources use hyphenated dates; and treatment of generic temporal pronouns, such as in "this time". Our experience suggests that future clarification and improvement of the TimeML TIMEX3 guidelines is warranted (especially in terms of adding examples and of dealing with SETs), perhaps as a contribution to ISO-TimeML.</p><p>The normalization granularity (level of detail) of some timexes is often complex. For example, when discussing the third quarter of 1989 with a DCT of 1989, "a year ago" could be interpreted as 1988-Q3 instead of 1988. In the evaluation datasets, there are ambiguities in this kind of expression.</p><p>Words that describe times briefly using contextual clues were also hard to normalise, as in "Why 10am? Why not twelve, or two, or four?". Complex cases were also difficult, such as with "Every 2 weeks at 16:00 on Saturday".</p><p>Finally, unusual phrases were difficult to interpret. These should be the easiest category of all for which to add rules to a communal resource. They include items such as "Purim", "the intercalary day" and "Mid-Autumn Festival". Gazetteers and other lists of holiday events contain explicit rules for resolving a holiday name to a date, given a year. Combing through these resources and adding them to TIMEN will improve our normalisation coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented an open and independent state-of-the-art tool for timex normalisation: TIMEN.</p><p>Its performance results show improvement in normalisation over recent approaches, demonstrating that TIMEN is a new effective resource for normalisation regardless of timex recognition approach. Furthermore, it removes the cost of re-developing a timex normalisation system. This saves time and favors the improvement of the resource via community contribution and evaluation. This makes TIMEN an extensible and reusable tool, finally overcoming the boundary that all previous timex normalisation systems have suffered from at the end of their development.</p><p>Regarding future work, the central effort is the ongoing extension and refinement of TIMEN's rule base. We encourage community participation in this. Improving performance through building up the rule base, will make TIMEN a viable long-term choice for timex normalisation.</p><p>We plan to extensively evaluate TIMEN over more data and publish a high-coverage normalisation resource not limited to English but including other languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Italian and Danish. As the TempEval-2 dataset includes many languages, initial construction of these rule bases can be data-driven. The nature of our framework reduces the barrier to adding new languages and to contribute to the normalisation of those languages, as it uses only a simple purpose-built rule syntax.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: TIMEN Architecture</figDesc></figure>

Recall 1.0 reflects that these results apply to all timexes in 
the datasets, since TIMEN does not do any timex recogni-
tion. 
So far, the current TIMEN version has only 76 rules 
covering only the most common timexes. Furthermore, 
TIMEN CONSUMER does not use sophisticated NLP 
such as syntactic or semantic parsing but just tense recog-
nition and timex tracking. With this young and incomplete 
rule set we obtained high results -90% in TempEval-2 and 
68% in TimenEval.

Results for TempEval-2 data are shown in Table 3. Given 
timexes with extents determined by each system, TIMEN 
performs better than built-in normalisation components in 
all cases except HeidelTime's, where it matches perfor-

just as TIMEN has.
