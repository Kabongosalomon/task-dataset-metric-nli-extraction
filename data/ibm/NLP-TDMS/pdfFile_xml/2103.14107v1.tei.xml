<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose to predict the future trajectories of observed agents (e.g., pedestrians or vehicles) by estimating and using their goals at multiple time scales. We argue that the goal of a moving agent may change over time, and modeling goals continuously provides more accurate and detailed information for future trajectory estimation. In this paper, we present a novel recurrent network for trajectory prediction, called Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet). Unlike prior work that models only a single, long-term goal, SGNet estimates and uses goals at multiple temporal scales. In particular, the framework incorporates an encoder module that captures historical information, a stepwise goal estimator that predicts successive goals into the future, and a decoder module that predicts future trajectory. We evaluate our model on three first-person traffic datasets (HEV-I, JAAD, and PIE) as well as on two bird's eye view datasets (ETH and UCY), and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both average and final displacement errors on all datasets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Predicting the future behavior of other agents is crucial in the real world <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: safe driving requires predicting future movements of other cars and pedestrians, for example, while effective social interactions require anticipating the actions of social partners. However, predicting another agent's future actions is challenging because it depends on numerous factors including the environment and the agent's internal state (e.g., its intentions and goals). Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> has explored goal-driven methods for future trajectory prediction, which explicitly estimate the goal state (e.g., destination) of an object to help * Equal contribution † Currently at Amazon/AWS AI <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Comparison between SGNet and other goaldriven methods for trajectory prediction. Unlike prior work that estimates only a distant goal to guide the prediction (dotted orange line), our approach estimates multiple goals to better model the future context (dotted cyan line). guide future trajectory estimation.</p><p>Although these recent models make an important step forward, they make the simplistic assumption that agents' trajectories are based only on a long-term goal that they are working towards. However, work in psychology and cognitive science shows that people base their actions not on a single long-term goal, but instead on series of goals at different time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. For example, a pedestrian wishing to cross the street needs to solve multiple smaller problems along the way: finding the crosswalk, waiting for cars to stop, avoiding other pedestrians, etc.</p><p>Based on this intuition from psychology, in this paper, we propose new techniques for future trajectory prediction. These techniques are based on three main hypotheses: (1) estimating the future at multiple time spans, even on a coarse level, provides guidance in decoding the trajectory (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>); (2) inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, these future goals can be used as supplementary input to aid in disentangling and encoding the current and past information, resulting in more discriminative representations that implicitly model the intention of the agent; and (3) inaccu-rate future goals may mislead the prediction, so adaptively learned weights can help the model to distinguish the importance of each stepwise goal.</p><p>To validate these hypotheses, we present a new recurrent encoder-decoder architecture, Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet), to address trajectory prediction. SGNet consists of three main components: (1) A stepwise goal estimator that predicts coarse successive goals into the future. Unlike prior work that models only a single, long-term goal, we use a lightweight module to estimate sequences of goals at multiple temporal scales. Attention mechanism is employed to enhance the important goal features.</p><p>(2) An encoder module that captures historical information along with predicted stepwise goals, to embed a better hidden representation, and better understand what will happen in the future. (3) A decoder module that takes advantage of goal information to predict future trajectories. SGNet can also incorporate a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) module that learns future trajectory distributions conditioned on the observed trajectories through a stochastic latent variable, and outputs multiple proposals. We evaluate our model on multiple first-person and third-person datasets, including both vehicles and pedestrians, and compare to an extensive range of existing work ranging from deterministic to stochastic approaches. We achieve the stateof-the-art performance on all benchmarks.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, our work highlights a novel direction for goal-driven trajectory prediction by using predicted stepwise goals. Second, we show how to effectively incorporate these goals into both encoder and decoder with attention mechanism. Our stepwise goal estimator is a very general module that can be used in numerous scenarios. Finally, our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including both first-and third-person viewpoints and different agents (i.e., car and pedestrians).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet)</head><p>At time step t, given an object's observed trajectory in the last e steps, X t = {x t− e +1 , x t− e+2 , . . . , x t }, where x t includes its bounding box position (i.e., centroid position, width, and height) and motion properties (e.g., optical flow, velocity, and acceleration), our goal is to predict its future positions Y t = {y t+1 , y t+2 , . . . , y t+ d } in the next d frames. Unlike state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> that estimate and use only an object's distant target, we hypothesize that explicitly incorporating both long-and shortterm goals at multiple time steps provides more comprehensive contextual information.

In general, SGNet decomposes trajectory prediction into three stages: encoder, SGE, and decoder (summarized in Alg. 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"># !#$ # !#% # !#&amp;! Goal t+ !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Encoder</head><p>The encoder captures an agent's movement behavior as a latent vector by embedding its historical trajectory X t using a single fully-connected layer. If additional motion features (e.g., optical flow) are available, they are also embedded using a separate fully-connected layer and concatenated with the trajectory representations,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x e t = ReLU (W T α X t + b α ).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The input feature x e t is then concatenated with the aggregated goal information x e t from the previous time step t − 1, and then the new hidden state h e t is updated through a recurrent cell,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h e t+1 = RNNCell e ([x e t+1 , x e t+1 ], h e t ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the brackets indicate concatenation. h e t+1 and x e t+1 are set to zero for the first time step. We next discuss how to obtain the aggregated goal input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Stepwise Goal Estimator (SGE)</head><p>The main idea of SGE is to generate coarse stepwise future goals to assist the trajectory prediction in a coarseto-fine manner. These goals also help the network better understand what probably will happen next. Consequently, we design SGE to predict and convey the predicted coarse stepwise goals to both encoder and decoder. For encoder, at each time step t, a set of stepwise goals from t − 1 is concatenated with the input to serve as supplementary features, helping the encoder learn a more discriminative representation of the sequence. Since inaccurate future goals may mislead the prediction, we use a goal aggregator that adaptively learns the importance of each stepwise goal by using an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, for decoder, at each time step t + i (i ∈ [1, d ]), a subset of stepwise goals h t+i: serves as coarse guidance to help trajectory prediction, and a goal aggregator again gathers and weights the selected goals.</p><p>We define a generic SGE module f SGE as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h g t+1: = f SGE (ReLU (W T γ h e t + b γ ))<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where encoder hidden state h e t is the input to SGE at time t. Then SGE module outputs a sequence of stepwise goals,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h g t+1: = {h g t+1 , h g t+2 , . . . , h g t+ d }.</formula><p>We found that SGE is open to different implementations including recurrent, convolution, and fully-connected layers, as will be described in Sec. 4.4. To regularize SGE to generate goals that contain precise future information, we regress the goal position Y g t using the same regressor defined in Sec. 3.4 to minimize the distance between goal position and the ground truth.</p><p>Goal Aggregator for Encoder. We hypothesize that anticipated goals can serve as supplementary features to help the encoder learn a more discriminative representation, and that each individual goal has different impact on the prediction. We thus define an attention function f e attn that takes stepwise goals h g t+1: = {h g t+1 , h g t+2 , ..., h g t+ d }, calculates corresponding weights over estimated goals, and outputs x e t+1 as additional input for the encoder,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x e t+1 = f e attn (h g t+1: ) = d s=t+1 w e s h g s (4) w e = Softmax(W T ζ Tanh(h g t+1: ) + b ζ ),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where w e is an attention vector corresponding to the probability distribution over d estimated goals, and w e s is the weight for each individual goal h g s . Goal Aggregator for Decoder. Stepwise goals are fed into the decoder at each time step in an incremental manner. For example, at time step t + i, the decoder receives goals between time step t + i and t + d , and the goals before t + i are ignored, because these are redundant and have been encoded in the historical information. Similar to how we aggregating goals for encoder, we implement an attention network to learn the weights of each subset of goals adaptively. The decoder input x d t+i is defined as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x d t+i = f d attn (h g t+i: ) = d s=t+i w d s h g s (6) w d = Softmax(W T η Tanh(h g t+i: ) + b η ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where w d is an attention vector corresponding to the probability distribution over d − i + 1 estimated goals, and w d s is the weight for each individual goal h g s .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)</head><p>SGNet can also include a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) module to learn and predict the distribution of future trajectory Y t conditioned on the observed trajectory X t , by introducing a Gaussian latent variable z ∼ N (µ z , σ z ). Following most prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, our CVAE consists of three main components: recognition network Q φ (z|X t , Y t ), prior network P ν (z|X t ), and generation network P θ (h d t |X t , z), where φ, ν, θ denote the parameter of these three networks, and h d t is the trajectory encoded by the generation network that will be fed into the decoder for trajectory prediction. In particular, recognition, prior, and generation networks are all realized by fully-connected layers.</p><p>During training, the ground truth future trajectory Y t is fed into the target encoder to output the hidden state h Yt . To capture the dependencies between observed and ground truth trajectories, the recognition network takes encoder hidden states h e t and h Yt and predicts the distribution mean µ q z and standard deviation σ q z . The prior network takes h e t only and predicts µ p z and σ p z . Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) loss is used to regularize the distribution between N (µ q z , σ q z ) and N (µ p z , σ p z ). We sample z from N (µ q z , σ q z ) and concatenate it with h e t to generate h d t with the generation network. During testing, the ground truth future trajectory Y t is not available, so we directly sample z from Update h e t with (x e t , x e t ) and h e t−1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Loss Functions</head><p>We train our model in an end-to-end manner. We choose to use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as loss function to supervise trajectory prediction from our decoder. For our stochastic model using CAVE, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> and adapt best-of-many (BoM) approach to minimize the distance between our best prediction Y t and target Y t . This approach leads to more accurate and diverse predictions and encourages the model to capture the true variation in data. To   ensure SGE to predict accurate goal states, we also optimize the prediction from SGE using RMSE between goal prediction Y g t and ground truth Y t . Finally, we add KLdivergence loss (KLD) to optimize the prior network in the CVAE. Thus, for each training sample, our final loss is summarized as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L total = min ∀k∈K RMSE( Y k t , Y t ) + RMSE( Y g t , Y t ) + KLD(Q φ (z|X t , Y t ), P ν (z|X t )),<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where Y k t is the k-th trajectory hypothesis from CVAE, Y g t is the predicted stepwise goal location, and Y t is the object's ground truth location at time t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>We evaluated SGNet against multiple state-of-the-art methods on three first-person datasets (Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving (JAAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and Honda Egocentric View Intersection (HEV-I) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>) and two bird's eye view datasets (ETH <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and UCY <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). These diverse datasets with different viewpoints (first-and third-person) and agent types (pedestrians and vehicles) challenge our model's robustness in complex, dynamic situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Datasets</head><p>JAAD and PIE include egocentric videos of pedestrians in traffic scenes and dynamic conditions. JAAD contains 2,800 trajectories, while PIE's includes 1,835 trajectories. All videos are captured 1920 × 1080 pixels at 30fps. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and sample tracks with an overlap ratio of 0.5, discard tracks with length below 2 sec, and use 0.5 sec of observed data as input to predict future trajectories of length 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 sec.</p><p>HEV-I contains 230 first-person videos of vehicles at 10 fps. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, we split the data into 40,000 train (70%) and 17,000 test (30%) samples. HEV-I does not include human annotations, so we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and use Mask-RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Sort <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to generate "ground truth" trajectories. We use 1.6 sec of observed data as input to predict future trajectories of length 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 sec.</p><p>ETH and UCY focus on pedestrians with multi-human interaction scenarios from a bird's eye view, and contain diverse behaviors such as couples walking together, groups passing by each other, and groups forming and dispersing. The dataset is captured at 25 fps and annotated at 2.5 fps, and includes 1536 pedestrians in 5 sets of data with 4 unique scenes. Following prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, we use a leave-one-out strategy to split the train and test partitions. We use 3.2 sec as observed input data to predict 4.8 sec future trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Implementation Details</head><p>We implement our networks in PyTorch, and perform all experiments with Nvidia Titan Xp Pascal GPUs. We use Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) as the backbone for both encoder and decoder with 512 hidden size. The length of the observation e is determined by the default setting of each benchmark: e is 16 on HEV-I, 15 on JAAD, 15 on PIE, and 8 on ETH-UCY. Object bounding boxes are taken as inputs for JAAD and PIE, and following <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, optical flow is also included on HEV-I. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to use object centroid, velocities, and accelerations as inputs for ETH and UCY. We use the Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> optimizer with default parameters and initial learning rate 5 × 10 −4 , which is dynamically reduced based on the validation loss. Our models are optimized end-to-end with batch size 128 and the training is terminated after 50 epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Evaluation Protocols</head><p>Our main evaluation metrics include average displacement error (ADE), which measures accuracy along the whole trajectory, and final displacement error (FDE), which measures accuracy only at the trajectory end point. We use mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate our per-   formance on JAAD and PIE, calculated according to the upper-left and lower-right coordinates of the bounding box. We also adopt Center mean squared error (C M SE ) and center final mean squared error (CF M SE ) as evaluation metrics on JAAD and PIE. These two error metrics are similar to MSE except they are computed based on the bounding box centroids. To fairly compare with prior work on HEV-I dataset, we use the upper-left coordinates of bounding boxes to calculate ADE and FDE. In the bird's eye view ETH and UCY datasets, we follow prior work to use the centroid points to calculate ADE and FDE. To compare to the state-of-the-art method <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> in HEV-I, we also use final intersection over union (FIOU), the overlap between the predicted bounding box and ground truth at the final step, which measures the model's ability to predict both the scale and location of bounding boxes in the long-term. All results metrics used for HEV-I, JAAD, and PIE dataset are in pixels, while for ETH and UCY we compute the ADE and FDE in Euclidean space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Exploration Study</head><p>We begin with experiments for design trade-offs and training strategies of our architecture with JAAD and PIE.</p><p>How to implement SGE? We considered three instantia-tions of f attn in the SGE module. First, we implement SGE with GRUs (named SGNet-ED-GRU). The hidden size is set to 128, since we only need a lightweight module to produce a coarse goal prediction. h g t+i is defined to be the hidden state at time t + i, which is initialized by using the encoder hidden state h e t after a linear transformation. The GRU input x g t+1 is initialized with a zero vector and updated using the auto-regressive strategy, and the sequence of the output hidden state at each time step is used as the stepwise goals. Second, we try SGE with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that takes the encoder hidden states h e t as input, and directly outputs d goals of size 128. We call this SGNet-ED-MLP. Third, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and implement a convolution-deconvolution framework for SGE to predict the stepwise goals, called SGNet-ED-CNN.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, all of the above variants achieve the state-of-the-art results, indicating that the SGE module is not sensitive to the choice of f attn . The results also suggest that using temporal models, such as GRU, as SGE is more effective and robust in future trajectory prediction. Since SGNet-ED-GRU achieves the best performance, we use this version in the remaining experiments (named SGNet-ED).</p><p>What if decoder does not receive predicted goals? To evaluate the importance of using predicted goals in the de-   coder, we implement a baseline (SGNet-E) without the connection between SGE and the decoder. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> shows that our best model significantly outperforms this baseline, indicating that using predicted goals in the decoder is important for achieving more accurate results.</p><p>What if encoder does not receive predicted goals? To evaluate the importance of using predicted goals in the encoder, we remove the connection between SGE and encoder (SGNet-D). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, the performance of our best model is also better than this baseline on both datasets. These results confirm the importance of using predicted goals in the encoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does SGE need supervision?</head><p>To investigate whether supervised stepwise goals offer more accurate information for trajectory prediction, we train our network without the goal module loss, RMSE( Y g t , Y t ). This change increases the error of our best model by 13/68/208 and 15/57/181 on JAAD and PIE, respectively, in terms of 0.5s/1.0s/1.5s MSE. This suggests that supervision on SGE leads to better goal representation to help predicting trajectory, and thus using loss to optimize SGE is important in our model.</p><p>To conclude, our full model, called SGNet-ED, uses GRU as the backbone for SGE, and the output stepwise goals are fed into both encoder and decoder. Our final loss function includes the SGE loss, BoM trajectory loss, and KLD loss, as shown in Eq. 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Comparison with the State of the Art</head><p>In this section, we compare our best model (SGNet-ED) with the state-of-the-art methods under two different settings: deterministic, in which the model returns a single trajectory, and stochastic, in which it generates a set of K possible trajectories and we report the best-performing sample. More specifically, to obtain the deterministic results, we replace the CVAE module with a non-linear embedding to predict a single trajectory. Both results are compared with an extensive set of published baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1">Deterministic Results</head><p>First-person benchmarks. We start by evaluating our model's performance on predicting pedestrian trajectory in two first-person datasets. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>, our best model (SGNet-ED) significantly outperforms the state-ofthe art on the first-person pedestrian detection datasets. On JAAD, our model reduces the MSE error by 11, 50, and 157 pixels for 0.5s, 1.0s and 1.5s prediction, respectively, compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. On PIE, our model reduces MSE error by 7, 28, and 69 for 0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s prediction, respectively. As the prediction length increases (and thus the problem becomes harder), comparing to prior work, our improvement is even larger, suggesting that SGE is especially helpful for  long-term prediction. We get similar results by using other evaluation metrics, as shown in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> presents comparisons between SGNet and prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> on vehicle trajectory prediction in HEV-I. SGNet-ED outperforms this baseline by 0.42, 1.25, and 2.13 in terms of 0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 4.24 in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE). Moreover, the improvement in 1.5s FIOU shows that our model can also accurately predict the scale of objects.</p><p>Third-person benchmarks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> shows that, on average, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 10% in terms of ADE and FDE on the bird's eye view datasets. The results demonstrate that our model predicts persistent and stable future trajectories. As with the first-person datasets, our model leads to a larger improvement as the prediction length increases, suggesting that estimated stepwise goals offer better temporal information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2">Stochastic Results</head><p>First-person benchmarks. To fairly compare with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we generate K = 20 possible proposals and report the best-performance sample during evaluation. For the firstperson datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 14% on average on JAAD and 25% on average on PIE, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>. We do not report results on HEV-I since there is no existing stochastic benchmark to our knowledge.</p><p>Third-person benchmarks. For ETH-UCY, we follow the leave-one-out evaluation protocol with K = 20 by following the prior work in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref>. SGNet-ED outperforms the current state-of-the-art stochastic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> by 5% on average on ETH, ZARA1 and ZARA2, and achieves comparable results on HOTEL and UNIV. Our model does not explicitly model interaction, but has a relatively strong temporal model, which may explain why our model is better on less complex scenes (ETH, ZARA1 and ZARA2). Including interaction and map features may help our model to improve on crowd scenes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Qualitative Results</head><p>The first row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows four examples of our best model's deterministic predictions. the first example, the ego-vehicle is stopping at the intersection and a pedestrian is walking along the marked crosswalk. In the second example, the shape of the marked vehicles change as they are making turns, making it challenging to predict their size and distance. In the third and fourth examples, we show our model's deterministic prediction result on ETH and UCY.</p><p>The second row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> shows four examples of our best model's stochastic predictions. We show all K = 20 stochastic trajectories generated by our best model. Most of the predictions are close to the ground truth trajectory and bounding box, demonstrating the stability of our stochastic prediction model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> studies four failure cases of our model. In the top-left example, the vehicle pulls to the right suddenly and drives forward in the scene, but the observed trajectory of the pedestrian is nearly still. Since we only use the bounding boxes to represent the agents' states, it is difficult for our model to predict the agent's relative movement caused by an unexpected and large motion of the ego-vehicle. However, using ego-motion information in our model may help to improve this. In the bottom-left example, the marked person is descending the stairs in the near future, but our model fails to predict the correct trajectory due to the lack of context information and interaction between pedestrians. In the top-right example, most of the stochastic predictions show the pedestrian walking along the road, but one prediction indicates the possibility that the pedestrian may cross the road along the zebra crossing. However, this error may be a "blessing in disguise", for example helping an autonomous driving system to prepare for a potential future risk. In the bottom-right example, our stochastic model fails to predict the future when the target pedestrian interacts with another. We believe taking object interaction into consideration is a good direction for our future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet) to tackle the trajectory prediction problem. Unlike most existing goal-driven models that only estimates final destination or distant goals, SGNet predicts both longand short-term goals and explicitly incorporates these estimated future states into both encoder and decoder. We show that these goals can help to predict the trajectory as well as to better capture the historical observations. Our Stepwise Goal Estimator (SGE) can be used as a general plugin module, and is robust to various ways to be implemented. We conducted extensive experiments on three first-person and two bird's eye view datasets to evaluate both the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that our models outperform the state-of-theart methods. In the future, we plan to include object interaction and environment information to enhance our model, and to consider ego-motion which would help our model in first-person trajectory prediction.</p></div>
