<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ECENTLY, a plethora of approaches to Mixed Sample Data Augmentation (MSDA) have been proposed which obtain state-of-the-art results, particularly in classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. MSDA involves combining data samples according to some policy to create an augmented data set on which to train the model. The policies so far proposed can be broadly categorised as either combining samples with interpolation (e.g. MixUp) or masking (e.g. CutMix). Traditionally, augmentation is viewed through the framework of statistical learning as Vicinal Risk Minimisation (VRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. Given some notion of the vicinity of a data point, VRM trains with vicinal samples in addition to the data points themselves. This is the motivation for MixUp <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; to provide a new notion of vicinity based on mixing data samples. In the classical theory, validity of this technique relies on E. Harris, A. Marcu and M. Painter contributed equally to this work. the strong assumption that the vicinal distribution precisely matches the true distribution of the data. As a result, the classical goal of augmentation is to maximally increase the data space, without changing the data distribution. Clearly, for all but the most simple augmentation strategies, the data distribution is in some way distorted. Furthermore, there may be practical implications to correcting this, as is demonstrated in Touvron et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. In light of this, three important questions arise regarding MSDA: What is good measure of the similarity between the augmented and the original data? Why is MixUp so effective when the augmented data looks so different? If the data is distorted, what impact does this have on trained models?</p><p>To construct a good measure of similarity, we note that the data only need be 'perceived' similar by the model. As such, we measure the mutual information between representations learned from the real and augmented data, thus characterising how well learning from the augmented data simulates learning from the real data. This measure shows the data-level distortion of MixUp by demonstrating that learned representations are compressed in comparison to those learned from the unaugmented data. To address the efficacy of MixUp, we look to the information bottleneck theory of deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. By the data processing inequality, summarised as 'post-processing cannot increase information', deep networks can only discard information about the input with depth whilst preserving information about the targets. Tishby and Zaslavsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> assert that more efficient generalisation is achieved when each layer maximises the information it has about the target and minimises the information it has about the previous layer. Consequently, we posit that the distortion and subsequent compression induced by MixUp promotes generalisation. Another way to view this is that compression prevents the network from learning about highly sample-specific features in the data. Regarding the impact on trained models, and again armed with the knowledge that MixUp distorts learned functions, we show that MixUp acts as a kind of adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, promoting robustness to additive noise. This accords with the theoretical result of Perrault-Archambault et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and the robustness results of Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, we further show that MSDA does not generally improve adversarial robustness when measured as a worst case accuracy following multiple attacks as suggested by Carlini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Ultimately, our adversarial robustness experiments show that the distortion in the data observed by our mutual information analysis corresponds to practical differences in learned function.</p><p>In contrast to our findings regarding MixUp, our mutual information analysis shows that CutMix causes learned models to retain a good knowledge of the real data, which we argue derives from the fact that individual features extracted by a convolutional model generally only derive from one of the mixed data points. This is further shown by our adversarial robustness results, where CutMix is not found to promote robustness in the same way. We therefore suggest that CutMix limits the ability of the model to over-fit by dramatically increasing the number of observable data points without distorting the data distribution, in keeping with the original intent of VRM. However, by restricting to only masking a square region, CutMix imposes some unnecessary limitations. First, the number of possible masks could be much greater if more mask shapes could be used. Second, it is likely that there is still some distortion since all of the images used during training will involve a square edge. It should be possible to construct an MSDA which uses masking similar to CutMix whilst increasing the data space much more dramatically. Motivated by this, we introduce FMix, a masking MSDA that uses binary masks obtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images sampled randomly from Fourier space. Using our mutual information measure, we show that learning with FMix simulates learning from the real data even better than CutMix. We subsequently demonstrate performance of FMix for a range of models and tasks against a series of augmented baselines and other MSDA approaches. FMix obtains a new single model state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> without external data and improves the performance of several state-ofthe-art models (ResNet, SE-ResNeXt, DenseNet, WideResNet, PyramidNet, LSTM, and Bert) on a range of problems and modalities.</p><p>In light of our experimental results, we go on to suggest that the compressing qualities of MixUp are most desirable when data is limited and learning from individual examples is easier. In contrast, masking MSDAs such as FMix are most valuable when data is abundant. We suggest that there is no reason to see the desirable properties of masking and interpolation as mutually exclusive. In light of these observations, we plot the performance of MixUp, FMix, a baseline, and a hybrid policy where we alternate between batches of MixUp and FMix, as the number of CIFAR-10 training examples is reduced. This experiment confirms our above suggestions and shows that the hybrid policy can outperform both MixUp and FMix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we review the fundamentals of MSDA. Let p X (x) denote the input data distribution. In general, we can define MSDA for a given mixing function, mix(X 1 , X 2 , Λ), where X 1 and X 2 are independent random variables on the data domain and Λ is the mixing coefficient. Synthetic minority over-sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a predecessor to modern MSDA approaches, can be seen as a special case of the above where X 1 and X 2 are dependent, jointly sampled as nearest neighbours in feature space. These synthetic samples are drawn only from the minority class to be used in conjunction with the original data, addressing the problem of imbalanced data. The mixing function is linear interpolation, mix(x 1 , x 2 , λ) = λx 1 + (1 − λ)x 2 , and p Λ = U(0, 1). More recently, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Tokozume et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and Inoue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> concurrently proposed using this formulation (as MixUp, Between-Class (BC) learning, and sample pairing respectively) on the whole data set, although the choice of distribution for the mixing coefficients varies for each approach. Tokozume et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> subsequently proposed BC+, which uses a normalised variant of the mixing function. We refer to these approaches as interpolative MSDA, where, following Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we use the symmetric Beta distribution, that is p Λ = Beta(α, α).</p><p>Recent variants adopt a binary masking approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Let M = mask(Λ) be a random variable with mask(λ) ∈ {0, 1} n and µ(mask(λ)) = λ, that is, generated masks are binary with average value equal to the mixing coefficient. The mask mixing function is mix(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 , x 2 , m) = m x 1 + (1 − m) x 2 , where</formula><p>denotes point-wise multiplication. A notable masking MSDA which motivates our approach is CutMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. CutMix is designed for two dimensional data, with mask(λ) ∈ {0, 1} w×h , and uses mask(λ) = rand rect(w</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">√ 1 − λ, h √ 1 − λ),</formula><p>where rand rect(r w , r h ) ∈ {0, 1} w×h yields a binary mask with a shaded rectangular region of size r w ×r h at a uniform random coordinate. CutMix improves upon the performance of MixUp on a range of experiments.</p><p>In all MSDA approaches the targets are mixed in some fashion, typically to reflect the mixing of the inputs. For the typical case of classification with a cross entropy loss (and for all of the experiments in this work), the objective function is simply the interpolation between the cross entropy against each of the ground truth targets. It could be suggested that by mixing the targets differently, one might obtain better results. However, there are key observations from prior art which give us cause to doubt this supposition; in particular, Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> performed a number of experiments on the importance of the mixing ratio of the labels in MixUp. They concluded that when the targets are not mixed in the same proportion as the inputs the model can be regularised to the point of underfitting. However, despite this conclusion their results show only a mild performance change even in the extreme event that targets are mixed randomly, independent of the inputs. For these reasons, we focus only on the development of a better input mixing function for the remainder of the paper. Attempts to explain the success of MSDAs were not only made when they were introduced, but also through subsequent empirical and theoretical studies. In addition to their experimentation with the targets, Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> argue that linear interpolation of inputs limits the memorisation ability of the network. Gontijo-Lopes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> propose two measures to explain the impact of augmentation on generalisation when jointly optimised: affinity and diversity. While the former captures the shift in the data distribution as perceived by the baseline model, the latter measures the training loss when learning with augmented data. A more mathematical view on MSDA was adopted by Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, who argue that MixUp regularises the model by constraining it outside the data manifold. They point out that this could lead to reducing the space of possible hypotheses, but could also lead to generated examples contradicting original ones, degrading quality. Upon Taylor-expanding the objective, Carratino et al.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> take a statistical learning view of MSDA, basing their study on the observation that MSDA distorts the data distribution and thus does not perform VRM in the traditional sense. They subsequently propose separating features into 'minor' and 'major', where a feature is referred to as 'minor' if it is highly sample-specific. Augmentations that significantly affect the distribution are said to make the model predominantly learn from 'major' features. From an information theoretic perspective, ignoring these 'minor' features corresponds to increased compression of the input by the model. Although He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> noted the importance of characterising the effect of data augmentation from an information perspective, they did not explore any measures that do so. Instead, He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> analysed the variance in the learned representations. This is analogous to the entropy of the representation since entropy can be estimated via the pairwise distances between samples, with higher distances corresponding to both greater entropy and variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. In proposing Manifold MixUp, Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> additionally suggest that MixUp works by increasing compression. The authors compute the singular values of the representations in early layers of trained networks, with smaller singular values again corresponding to lower entropy. A potential issue with these approaches is that the entropy of the representation is only an upper bound on the information that the representation has about the input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ANALYSIS</head><p>We now analyse both interpolative and masking MSDAs with a view to distinguishing their impact on learned representations and finding answers to the questions established in our introduction. We first desire a measure which captures the extent to which learning about the augmented data simulates learning about the original data. We propose training unsupervised models on real data and augmented data and then measuring the mutual information, the reduction in uncertainty about one variable given knowledge of another, between the representations they learn. To achieve this, we use Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, which provide a rich depiction of the salient or compressible information in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Note that we do not expect these representations to directly relate to those of trained classifiers. Our requirement is a probabilistic model of the data, for which a VAE is well suited. We wish to estimate the mutual information between the representation learned by a VAE from the original data set, Z X , and the representation learned from some augmented data set,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Z A , written I(Z X ; Z A ) = E Z X D p (Z A | Z X ) p Z A .</formula><p>This quantity acts as a good measure of the similarity between the augmented and the original data since it captures only the similarity between learnable or salient features. VAEs comprise an encoder, p (Z | X) , and a decoder, p (X | Z) . We impose a Normal prior on Z, and train the model to maximise the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) objective</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L = E X E Z | X log(p (X | Z) ) − D p (Z | X) N (0, I) . (1)</formula><p>Denoting the outputs of the decoder of the VAE trained on the augmentation asX = decode(Z X ), and by the data processing inequality, we have I(Z A ;X) ≤ I(Z A ; Z X ) with equality when the decoder retains all of the information in Z. Now, we need only observe that we already have a model of p (Z A | X) , the encoder trained on the augmented data. Estimating the marginal p Z A presents a challenge as it is a Gaussian mixture. However, we can measure an alternative form of the mutual information that is equivalent up to an additive constant, and for which the divergence has a closed form solution, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">EX D p (Z A |X) p Z A = EX D p (Z A |X) N (0, I) − D p Z A N (0, I) . (2)</formula><p>The above holds for any choice of distribution that does not depend onX. Conceptually, this states that we will always lose more information on average if we approximate p (Z A |X) with any constant distribution other than the marginal p Z A . Additionally note that we implicitly minimise D p Z A N (0, I) during training of the VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. In light of this fact, we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I(Z A ;X) ≈ EX [D p (Z A |X) N (0, I) ].</formula><p>We can now easily obtain a helpful upper bound of I(Z A ; Z X ) such that it is bounded on both sides. Since Z A is just a function of X, again by the data processing inequality, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I(Z A ; X) ≥ I(Z A ; Z X )</formula><p>. This is easy to compute since it is just the relative entropy term from the ELBO objective.</p><p>To summarise, we can compute our measure by first training two VAEs, one on the original data and one on the augmented data. We then generate reconstructions of data points in the original data with one VAE and encode them in the other. We now compute the expected value of the relative entropy between the encoded distribution and an estimate of the marginal to obtain an estimate of a lower bound of the mutual information between the representations. We then recompute this using real data points instead of reconstructions to obtain an upper bound. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table I</ref> gives these quantities for MixUp, CutMix, and a baseline. The results show that MixUp consistently reduces the amount of information that is learned about the original data. In contrast, CutMix manages to induce greater mutual information with the data than is obtained from just training on the un-augmented data. Crucially, the results present concrete evidence that interpolative MSDA differs fundamentally from masking MSDA in how it impacts learned representations.</p><p>Having shown this is true for VAEs, we now wish to understand whether the finding also holds for trained classifiers. To this end, we analysed the decisions made by a classifier using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Grad-CAM finds the regions in an image that contribute the most to the network's prediction by taking the derivative of the model's output with respect to the activation maps and weighting them according to their contribution. If MixUp prevents the network from learning about highly specific features in the data we would expect more of the early features to contribute to the network output. It would be difficult to ascertain qualitatively whether this is the case. Instead, we compute the average sum of Grad-CAM heatmaps over the CIFAR-10 test set for 5 repeats (independently trained PreAct-ResNet18 models). We obtain the following scores: baseline -146 ±5 , MixUp -162 ±3 , CutMix -131 ±6 . The result suggests that more of the early features contribute to the decisions made by MixUp trained models and that this result is consistent across independent runs.</p><p>Having established that MixUp distorts learned functions, we now seek to answer the third question from our introduction by determining the impact of data distortion on trained classifiers. Since it is our assessment that models trained with MixUp have an altered 'perception' of the data distribution, we suggest an analysis based on adversarial attacks, which involve perturbing images outside of the perceived data distribution to alter the given classification. We perform fast gradient sign method, standard gradient descent, projected gradient descent, additive uniform noise, and DeepFool <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> attacks over the whole CIFAR-10 test set on PreAct-ResNet18 models subject to ∞ constraints using the Foolbox library <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. The plots for the additive uniform noise and DeepFool attacks, given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, show that MixUp provides an improvement over CutMix and the augmented baseline in this setting. This is because MixUp acts as a form of adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, equipping the models with valid classifications for images of a similar nature to those generated by the additive noise and DeepFool attacks. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we additionally plot the worst case robustness following all attacks as suggested by Carlini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. These results show that the adversarial training effect of MixUp is limited and does not correspond to a general increase in robustness. The key observation regarding these results is that there may be practical consequences to training with MixUp that are present but to a lesser degree when training with CutMix. There may be value to creating a new MSDA that goes even further than CutMix to minimise these practical consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. FMIX: IMPROVED MASKING</head><p>Our principle finding is that the masking MSDA approach works because it effectively preserves the data distribution in a way that interpolative MSDAs do not, particularly in the perceptual space of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This derives from the fact that each convolutional neuron at a particular spatial position generally encodes information from only one of the inputs at a time. This could also be viewed as local consistency in the sense that elements that are close to each other in space typically derive from the same data point. To the detriment of CutMix, the number of possible examples is limited by only using square masks. In this section we propose FMix, a masking MSDA which maximises the number of possible masks whilst preserving local consistency.</p><p>For local consistency, we require masks that are predominantly made up of a single shape or contiguous region. We might think of this as trying to minimise the number of times the binary mask transitions from '0' to '1' or vice-versa. For our approach, we begin by sampling a low frequency greyscale mask from Fourier space which can then be converted to binary with a threshold. We will first detail our approach for obtaining the low frequency image before discussing our approach for choosing the threshold. Let Z denote a complex random variable with values on the domain Z = C w×h , with density p (Z) = N (0, I w×h ) and p (Z) = N (0, I w×h ), where and return the real and imaginary parts of their input respectively. Let freq(w, h) [i, j] denote the magnitude of the sample frequency corresponding to the i, j'th bin of the w × h discrete Fourier transform. We can apply a low pass filter to Z by decaying its high frequency components. Specifically, for a given decay power δ, we use</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">filter(z, δ)[i, j] = z[i, j] freq(w, h) [i, j] δ .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Defining F −1 as the inverse discrete Fourier transform, we can obtain a grey-scale image with</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">G = F −1 filter Z, δ .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>All that now remains is to convert the grey-scale image to a binary mask such that the mean value is some given λ. Let top(n, x) return a set containing the top n elements of the input x. Setting the top λwh elements of some grey-scale image g to have value '1' and all others to have value '0' we obtain a binary mask with mean λ. Specifically, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">mask(λ, g)[i, j] = 1, if g[i, j] ∈ top(λwh, g) 0, otherwise .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>To recap, we first sample a random complex tensor for which both the real and imaginary part are independent and Gaussian. We then scale each component according to its frequency via the parameter δ such that higher values of δ correspond to increased decay of high frequency information. Next, we perform an inverse Fourier transform on the complex tensor and take the real part to obtain a grey-scale image. Finally, we set the top proportion of the image to have value '1' and the rest to have value '0' to obtain our binary mask. Although we have only considered two dimensional data here it is generally possible to create masks with any number of dimensions. We provide some example two dimensional masks and mixed images (with δ = 3 and λ = 0.5) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  2</ref>. We can see that the space of artefacts is significantly increased, furthermore, FMix achieves I(Z A ; X) = 83.67 ±0.89 , I(Z A ;X) = 80.28 ±0.75 , and MSE = 0.255 ±0.003 , showing that learning from FMix simulates learning from the un-augmented data to an even greater extent than CutMix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We now perform a series of experiments to compare the performance of FMix with that of MixUp, CutMix, and augmented baselines. For each problem setting and data set, we provide exposition on the results and any relevant caveats. Throughout, we use the hyper-parameters and light augmentations (flipping, normalisation, cropping, etc.) which yield the best results in the literature for each setting.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, we perform an ablation study in order to identify sensible default values for the FMix hyperparameters α and δ. We see that all α values perform similarly, with a slight peak at α = 1, which is equivalent to sampling the mixing coefficients from a uniform distribution. Consequently, we choose this value for the majority of our experiments. For decay powers δ &lt; 2, we see decreased accuracy and δ ≥ 2 offering relatively consistent accuracy. We choose δ = 3 for this reason and since it was found to produce large artefacts with sufficient diversity as seen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>For all experiments, we perform repeats where possible and report the average performance and standard deviation after the last epoch of training. A complete discussion of the experimental set-up can be found in Appendix A along with the standard augmentations used for all models on each data set. In all tables, we give the best result and results that are within its margin of error in bold. We discuss any cases where the results obtained by us do not match the results obtained by the authors in the accompanying text, and give the authors results in parentheses. Uncertainty estimates are the standard deviation over 5 repeats. Code for all experiments is provided at https://github.com/ecs-vlc/FMix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Image Classification</head><p>We first discuss image classification results on the CIFAR-10/100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, Fashion MNIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, and Tiny-ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> data sets. Our experiments use the original version of the Fashion MNIST data set (the same data used with Random Erase <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>), which had some overlap between the train and test sets. As such, on the most recent version of the data set we would expect slightly (around 0.3%) lower test performance. We train: PreAct-ResNet18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, WideResNet-28-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, DenseNet-BC-190 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and PyramidNet-272-200 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. For PyramidNet, we additionally apply Fast AutoAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, a successor to AutoAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, and ShakeDrop <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> following Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table II</ref> show that FMix offers a significant improvement (greater than one standard deviation) over the other methods on test, with the exception  of the WideResNet on CIFAR-10/100 and the PreAct-ResNet on Tiny-ImageNet. In combination with PyramidNet, FMix achieves, to the best of our knowledge, a new state-of-theart single model classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 without use of external data. By the addition of Fast AutoAugment, this setting bares some similarity to the recently proposed AugMix <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> which performs MixUp on heavily augmented variants of the same image. Note that Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> also performed experiments with the PreAct-ResNet18, WideResNet-28-10, and DenseNet-BC-190 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. There are some discrepancies between the authors results and the results obtained by our implementation. Whether any differences are significant is difficult to ascertain as no measure of deviation is provided in Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, since our implementation is based on the implementation from Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and most of the differences are small, we have no reason to doubt it. We speculate that these discrepancies are simply a result of random initialisation, but could also be due to differences in reporting or training configuration (we report the average terminal accuracy, some works report the best accuracy achieved at any point during training). Next, we obtain classification results on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC2012) data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. We train a ResNet-101 on the full data set (ImageNet), additionally evaluating on ImageNet-a <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, a set of natural adversarial examples to ImageNet models, to further assess adversarial robustness. We train for 90 epochs with a batch size of 256. We perform experiments with both α = 1.0 and α = 0.2 (as this was used by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). The results, given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table III</ref>, show that FMix was the only MSDA to provide an improvement over the baseline with these hyper-parameters. Note that MixUp obtains an accuracy of 78.5 in Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> when using a batch size of 1024. Additionally note that MixUp obtains an accuracy of 79. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> and CutMix obtains an accuracy of 79.83 in Yun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> when training for 300 epochs. Due to hardware constraints we cannot replicate these settings and so it is not known how FMix would compare. On ImageNet-a, the general finding is that MSDA gives a good improvement in robustness to adversarial examples. Interestingly, MixUp with α = 1.0 yields a lower accuracy on ImageNet but a much higher accuracy on ImageNet-a. Since the ImageNet-a examples are chosen specifically to fool an ImageNet trained ResNet, good performance on ImageNet-a does not necessarily imply greater adversarial robustness. Instead, ImageNet-a performance can be viewed as a measure of how much the learned function differs from the baseline. These results support our argument since models which were less distorted (worse ImageNet-a performance) tended to perform better on ImageNet.</p><p>For a final experiment with image data, we use the Bengali.AI handwritten grapheme classification data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, from a recent Kaggle competition. Classifying graphemes is a multiclass problem, they consist of a root graphical form (a vowel or consonant, 168 classes) which is modified by the addition of other vowel (11 classes) or consonant (7 classes) diacritics. To correctly classify the grapheme requires classifying each of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> with an SE-ResNeXt-50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>. these individually, where only the root is necessarily always present. We train separate models for each sub-class, and report the individual classification accuracies and the combined accuracy (where the output is considered correct only if all three predictions are correct). We report results for 5 folds where 80% of the data is used for training and the rest for testing. We extract the region of the image which contains the grapheme and resize to 64 × 64, performing no additional augmentation. The results for these experiments, with an SE-ResNeXt-50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>, are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table IV</ref>. FMix and CutMix both clearly offer strong improvement over the baseline and MixUp, with FMix performing significantly better than CutMix on the root and vowel classification tasks. As a result, FMix obtains a significant improvement when classifying the whole grapheme. In addition, note that FMix was used in the competition by Singer and Gordeev <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> in their second place prize-winning solution. This was the best result obtained with MSDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Audio Classification</head><p>We now perform experiments on the Google Commands data set, which was created to promote deep learning research on speech recognition problems. It is comprised of 65,000 one second utterances of one of 30 words, with 10 of those words being the target classes and the rest considered unrelated or background noise. We perform MSDA on a Mel-frequency spectrogram of each utterance. The results for a PreAct ResNet-18 are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table II</ref>. We evaluate FMix, MixUp, and CutMix for the standard α = 1 used for the majority of our experiments and α = 0.2 recommended by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for MixUp. We see in both cases that FMix and CutMix improve performance over MixUp outside the margin of error, with the best result achieved by FMix with α = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Point Cloud Classification</head><p>We now demonstrate the extension of FMix to 3D through point cloud classification on ModelNet10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. We transform the pointclouds to a voxel representation before applying a 3D FMix mask. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table II</ref> reports the average median accuracy from the last 5 epochs, due to large variability in the results. Although mild, FMix does improve performance in this setting where neither MixUp nor CutMix can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Sentiment Analysis</head><p>We can further extend the MSDA formulation for classification of one dimensional data. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table V</ref>, we perform a series </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Combining MSDAs</head><p>We have established through our analysis that models trained with interpolative MSDA perform a different function to models trained with masking. We now wish to understand whether the benefits of interpolation and masking are mutually exclusive. We therefore perform experiments with simultaneous action of multiple MSDAs, alternating their application per batch with a PreAct-ResNet18 on CIFAR-10. A combination of interpolation and masking, particularly FMix+MixUp (96.30 ±0.08 ), gives the best results, with CutMix+MixUp performing slightly worse (96.26 ±0.04 ). In contrast, combining FMix and CutMix gives worse results (95.85 ±0.1 ) than using either method on its own. For a final experiment, we note that our results suggest that interpolation performs better when there is less data available (e.g. the IMDb data set) and that masking performs better when there is more data available (e.g. ImageNet and the Bengali.AI data set). This finding is supported by our analysis since it is always easier for the model to learn specific features, and so we would naturally expect that preventing this is of greater utility, when there is less data. We confirm this empirically by varying the size of the CIFAR-10 training set and training with different MSDAs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Notably, the FMix+MixUp policy obtains superior performance irrespective of the amount of available data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper we have introduced FMix, a masking MSDA that improves classification performance for a series of models, modalities, and dimensionalities. We believe the strength of masking methods resides in preserving local features and we improve upon existing approaches by increasing the number of possible mask shapes. We have verified this intuition through a novel analysis. Our analysis shows that interpolation causes models to encode more general features, whereas masking causes models to encode the same information as when trained with the original data whilst eliminating memorisation. Our preliminary experiments suggest that combining interpolative and masking MSDA could improve performance further, although further work is needed to fully understand this phenomenon. Future work should also look to expand on the finding that masking MSDA works well in combination with Fast AutoAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, perhaps by experimenting with similar methods like AutoAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> or RandAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS</head><p>In this section we provide the experimental details for all experiments presented in the main paper. Unless otherwise stated, the following parameters are chosen: α = 1, δ = 3, weight decay of 1 × 10 4 and optimised using SGD with momentum of 0.9. For cross validation experiments, 3 or 5 folds of 10% of the training data are generated and used for a single run each. Test set experiments use the entire training set and give evaluations on the test sets provided. If no test set is provided then a constant validation set of 10% of the available data is used. All experiments were run on a single GTX1080ti or V100, with the exceptions of ImageNet experiments (4 × GTX1080ti) and DenseNet/PyramidNet experiments (2 × V100). ResNet18 and LSTM experiments ran within 2 hours in all instances, PointNet experiments ran within 10 hours, WideResNet/DenseNet experiments ran within 2.5 days and auto-augment experiments ran within 10 days. For all image experiments we use standard augmentations to normalise the image to [0, 1] and perform random crops and random horizontal flips. For the google commands experiment we used the transforms and augmentations implemented here https://github. com/tugstugi/pytorch-speech-commands for their solution to the tensorflow speech recognition challenge. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Robustness of PreAct-ResNet18 models trained on CIFAR-10 with standard augmentations (Baseline) and the addition of MixUp and CutMix to the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), simple gradient descent, projected gradient descent, uniform noise, DeepFool<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, and the worst case performance after all attacks.

In order for MSDA to be effective, we group elements into batches of similar sequence length as is already a standard practice. This ensures that the mixing does not introduce multiple end tokens or other strange artefacts (as would be the case if batches were padded to a fixed length). The models used are: pre-trained FastText-300d<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> embedding followed by a simple three layer CNN<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, the FastText embedding followed by a two layer bi-directional LSTM<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>, and pretrained Bert<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> provided by the HuggingFace transformers library<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. For the LSTM and CNN models we compare MixUp and FMix with a baseline. For the Bert fine-tuning we do not compare to MixUp as the model input is a series of tokens, interpolations between which are meaningless. We first report results on the Toxic Comments<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> data set, a Kaggle competition to classify text into one of 6 classes. For this data set we report the ROC-AUC metric, as this was used in the competition. Note that these results are computed over the whole test set and are therefore not comparable to the competition scores, which were computed over a subset of the test data. In this setting, both MixUp and FMix provide an improvement over the baseline, with FMix consistently providing a further improvement over MixUp. The improvement when fine-tuning Bert with FMix is outside the margin of error of the baseline, but mild in comparison to the improvement obtained in the other settings. We additionally report results on the IMDb<ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, Yelp binary, and Yelp fine-grained<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref> data sets. For the IMDb data set, which has one tenth of the number of examples, we found α = 0.2 to give the best results for both MSDAs. Here, MixUp provides a clear improvement over both FMix and the baseline for both models. This suggests that MixUp may perform better when there are fewer examples.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Data set</cell><cell>Model</cell><cell>Baseline</cell><cell>FMix</cell><cell>MixUp</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">Toxic (ROC-AUC) 96.04 Yelp Fine-grained CNN CNN 63.78</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
