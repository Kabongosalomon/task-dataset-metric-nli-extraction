<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Neural networks have revolutionized many areas of machine intelligence, enabling superhuman accuracy for challenging image recognition tasks. However, the drive to improve accuracy often comes at a cost: modern state of the art networks require high computational resources beyond the capabilities of many mobile and embedded applications.</p><p>This paper introduces a new neural network architecture that is specifically tailored for mobile and resource constrained environments. Our network pushes the state of the art for mobile tailored computer vision models, by significantly decreasing the number of operations and memory needed while retaining the same accuracy.</p><p>Our main contribution is a novel layer module: the inverted residual with linear bottleneck. This module takes as an input a low-dimensional compressed representation which is first expanded to high dimension and filtered with a lightweight depthwise convolution. Features are subsequently projected back to a low-dimensional representation with a linear convolution. The official implementation is available as part of TensorFlow-Slim model library in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>This module can be efficiently implemented using standard operations in any modern framework and allows our models to beat state of the art along multiple performance points using standard benchmarks. Furthermore, this convolutional module is particularly suitable for mobile designs, because it allows to significantly reduce the memory footprint needed during inference by never fully materializing large intermediate tensors. This reduces the need for main memory access in many embedded hardware designs, that provide small amounts of very fast software controlled cache memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Tuning deep neural architectures to strike an optimal balance between accuracy and performance has been an area of active research for the last several years. Both manual architecture search and improvements in training algorithms, carried out by numerous teams has lead to dramatic improvements over early designs such as AlexNet <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, VGGNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, GoogLeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. , and ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Recently there has been lots of progress in algorithmic architecture exploration included hyperparameter optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11]</ref> as well as various methods of network pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref> and connectivity learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref>. A substantial amount of work has also been dedicated to changing the connectivity structure of the internal convolutional blocks such as in ShuffleNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> or introducing sparsity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>, opened up a new direction of bringing optimization methods including genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning to architectural search. However one drawback is that the resulting networks end up very complex. In this paper, we pursue the goal of developing better intuition about how neural networks operate and use that to guide the simplest possible network design. Our approach should be seen as complimentary to the one described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> and related work. In this vein our approach is similar to those taken by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22]</ref> and allows to further improve the performance, while providing a glimpse on its internal operation. Our network design is based on MobileNetV1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. It retains its simplicity and does not require any special operators while significantly improves its accuracy, achieving state of the art on multiple image classification and detection tasks for mobile applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Depthwise Separable Convolutions</head><p>Depthwise Separable Convolutions are a key building block for many efficient neural network architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref> and we use them in the present work as well. The basic idea is to replace a full convolutional operator with a factorized version that splits convolution into two separate layers. The first layer is called a depthwise convolution, it performs lightweight filtering by applying a single convolutional filter per input channel. The second layer is a 1 × 1 convolution, called a pointwise convolution, which is responsible for building new features through computing linear combinations of the input channels.</p><p>Standard convolution takes an h i × w i × d i input tensor L i , and applies convolutional kernel K ∈ R k×k×di×dj to produce an h i × w i × d j output tensor L j . Standard convolutional layers have the compu-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">tational cost of h i · w i · d i · d j · k · k.</formula><p>Depthwise separable convolutions are a drop-in replacement for standard convolutional layers. Empirically they work almost as well as regular convolutions but only cost:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h i · w i · d i (k 2 + d j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>which is the sum of the depthwise and 1 × 1 pointwise convolutions. Effectively depthwise separable convolution reduces computation compared to traditional layers by almost a factor of k 21 . MobileNetV2 uses k = 3 (3 × 3 depthwise separable convolutions) so the computational cost is 8 to 9 times smaller than that of standard convolutions at only a small reduction in accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Linear Bottlenecks</head><p>Consider a deep neural network consisting of n layers L i each of which has an activation tensor of dimensions h i × w i × d i . Throughout this section we will be discussing the basic properties of these activation tensors, which we will treat as containers of h i × w i "pixels" with d i dimensions. Informally, for an input set of real images, we say that the set of layer activations (for any layer L i ) forms a "manifold of interest". It has been long assumed that manifolds of interest in neural networks could be embedded in low-dimensional subspaces. In other words, when we look at all individual d-channel pixels of a deep convolutional layer, the information encoded in those values actually lie in some manifold, which in turn is embeddable into a low-dimensional subspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</p><p>At a first glance, such a fact could then be captured and exploited by simply reducing the dimensionality of a layer thus reducing the dimensionality of the operating space. This has been successfully exploited by MobileNetV1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> to effectively trade off between computation and accuracy via a width multiplier parameter, and has been incorporated into efficient model designs of other networks as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Following that intuition, the width multiplier approach allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the activation space until the manifold of interest spans this entire space. However, this intuition breaks down when we recall that deep convolutional neural networks actually have non-linear per coordinate transformations, such as ReLU. For example, ReLU applied to a line in 1D space produces a 'ray', where as in R n space, it generally results in a piece-wise linear curve with n-joints.</p><p>It is easy to see that in general if a result of a layer transformation ReLU(Bx) has a non-zero volume S, the points mapped to interior S are obtained via a linear transformation B of the input, thus indicating that the part of the input space corresponding to the full dimensional output, is limited to a linear transformation. In other words, deep networks only have the power of a linear classifier on the non-zero volume part of the Input Output/dim=2 Output/dim=3 Output/dim=5 Output/dim=15 Output/dim=30</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1:</head><p>Examples of ReLU transformations of low-dimensional manifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. In these examples the initial spiral is embedded into an n-dimensional space using random matrix T followed by ReLU, and then projected back to the 2D space using T −1 . In examples above n = 2, 3 result in information loss where certain points of the manifold collapse into each other, while for n = 15 to 30 the transformation is highly non-convex. output domain. We refer to supplemental material for a more formal statement. On the other hand, when ReLU collapses the channel, it inevitably loses information in that channel. However if we have lots of channels, and there is a a structure in the activation manifold that information might still be preserved in the other channels. In supplemental materials, we show that if the input manifold can be embedded into a significantly lower-dimensional subspace of the activation space then the ReLU transformation preserves the information while introducing the needed complexity into the set of expressible functions.</p><p>To summarize, we have highlighted two properties that are indicative of the requirement that the manifold of interest should lie in a low-dimensional subspace of the higher-dimensional activation space:</p><p>1. If the manifold of interest remains non-zero volume after ReLU transformation, it corresponds to a linear transformation.</p><p>(a) Residual block (b) Inverted residual block <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: The difference between residual block <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref> and inverted residual. Diagonally hatched layers do not use non-linearities. We use thickness of each block to indicate its relative number of channels. Note how classical residuals connects the layers with high number of channels, whereas the inverted residuals connect the bottlenecks. Best viewed in color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>ReLU is capable of preserving complete information about the input manifold, but only if the input manifold lies in a low-dimensional subspace of the input space.</p><p>These two insights provide us with an empirical hint for optimizing existing neural architectures: assuming the manifold of interest is low-dimensional we can capture this by inserting linear bottleneck layers into the convolutional blocks. Experimental evidence suggests that using linear layers is crucial as it prevents nonlinearities from destroying too much information. In Section 6, we show empirically that using non-linear layers in bottlenecks indeed hurts the performance by several percent, further validating our hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . We note that similar reports where non-linearity was helped were reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> where non-linearity was removed from the input of the traditional residual block and that lead to improved performance on CIFAR dataset.</p><p>For the remainder of this paper we will be utilizing bottleneck convolutions. We will refer to the ratio between the size of the input bottleneck and the inner size as the expansion ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Inverted residuals</head><p>The bottleneck blocks appear similar to residual block where each block contains an input followed by several bottlenecks then followed by expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. However, inspired by the intuition that the bottlenecks actually contain all the necessary information, while an expansion layer acts merely as an implementation detail that accompanies a non-linear transformation of the tensor, we use shortcuts directly between the bottlenecks. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> provides a schematic visualization of the difference in the designs. The motivation for inserting shortcuts is similar to that of classical residual connections: we want to improve the ability of a gradient to propagate across multiplier layers. However, the inverted design is considerably more memory efficient (see Section 5 for details), as well as works slightly better in our experiments.</p><p>Running time and parameter count for bottleneck convolution The basic implementation structure is illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For a block of size h × w, expansion factor t and kernel size k with d input channels and d output channels, the total number of multiply add required is h · w · d · t(d + k 2 + d ). Compared with (1) this expression has an extra term, as indeed we have an extra 1 × 1 convolution, however the nature of our networks allows us to utilize much smaller input and output dimensions. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> we compare the needed sizes for each resolution between MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Information flow interpretation</head><p>One interesting property of our architecture is that it provides a natural separation between the input/output domains of the building blocks (bottleneck layers), and the layer transformation -that is a non-linear function that converts input to the output. The former can be seen as the capacity of the network at each layer, whereas the latter as the expressiveness. This is in contrast with traditional convolutional blocks, both regular and separable, where both expressiveness and capacity are tangled together and are functions of the output layer depth.</p><p>In particular, in our case, when inner layer depth is 0 the underlying convolution is the identity function thanks to the shortcut connection. When the expansion ratio is smaller than 1, this is a classical residual convolutional block <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref>. However, for our purposes we show that expansion ratio greater than 1 is the most useful.</p><p>This interpretation allows us to study the expressiveness of the network separately from its capacity and we believe that further exploration of this separation is warranted to provide a better understanding of the network properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Model Architecture</head><p>Now we describe our architecture in detail. As discussed in the previous section the basic building block is a bottleneck depth-separable convolution with residuals. The detailed structure of this block is shown in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input</head><p>Operator Output <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Bottleneck residual block transforming from k to k channels, with stride s, and expansion factor t. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers described in the <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We use ReLU6 as the non-linearity because of its robustness when used with low-precision computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. We always use kernel size 3 × 3 as is standard for modern networks, and utilize dropout and batch normalization during training.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h × w × k 1x1 conv2d , ReLU6 h × w × (tk) h × w × tk 3x3 dwise s=s, ReLU6 h s × w s × (tk) h s × w s × tk linear 1x1 conv2d h s × w s × k</formula><p>With the exception of the first layer, we use constant expansion rate throughout the network. In our experiments we find that expansion rates between 5 and 10 result in nearly identical performance curves, with smaller networks being better off with slightly smaller expansion rates and larger networks having slightly better performance with larger expansion rates.</p><p>For all our main experiments we use expansion factor of 6 applied to the size of the input tensor. For example, for a bottleneck layer that takes 64-channel input tensor and produces a tensor with 128 channels, the intermediate expansion layer is then 64 · 6 = 384 channels.</p><p>Trade-off hyper parameters As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> we tailor our architecture to different performance points, by using the input image resolution and width multiplier as tunable hyper parameters, that can be adjusted depending on desired accuracy/performance trade-offs. Our primary network (width multiplier 1, 224 × 224), has a computational cost of 300 million multiply-adds and uses 3.4 million parameters. We explore the performance trade offs, for input resolutions from 96 to 224, and width multipliers of 0.35 to 1.4. The network computational cost ranges from 7 multiply adds to 585M MAdds, while the model size vary between 1.7M and 6.9M parameters.</p><p>One minor implementation difference, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> is that for multipliers less than one, we apply width multiplier to all layers except the very last convolutional layer. This improves performance for smaller models.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: MobileNetV2 : Each line describes a sequence of 1 or more identical (modulo stride) layers, repeated n times. All layers in the same sequence have the same number c of output channels. The first layer of each sequence has a stride s and all others use stride 1. All spatial convolutions use 3 × 3 kernels. The expansion factor t is always applied to the input size as described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: The max number of channels/memory (in Kb) that needs to be materialized at each spatial resolution for different architectures. We assume 16-bit floats for activations. For ShuffleNet, we use 2x, g = 3 that matches the performance of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2. For the first layer of MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet we can employ the trick described in Section 5 to reduce memory requirement. Even though ShuffleNet employs bottlenecks elsewhere, the nonbottleneck tensors still need to be materialized due to the presence of shortcuts between the non-bottleneck tensors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">7 2 × 320 conv2d 1x1 -1280 1 1 7 2 × 1280 avgpool 7x7 - - 1 - 1 × 1 × 1280 conv2d 1x1 - k -</formula></div>

The computation is scheduled in order to minimize the total number of tensors that needs to be stored in memory. In the most general case, it searches over all plausible computation orders Σ(G) and picks the one that minimizes</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M (G) = min π∈Σ(G) max i∈1..n   A∈R(i,π,G) |A|   + size(π i ).</formula><p>where R(i, π, G) is the list of intermediate tensors that are connected to any of π i . . . π n nodes, |A| represents the size of the tensor A and size(i) is the total amount of memory needed for internal storage during operation i.</p><p>For graphs that have only trivial parallel structure (such as residual connection), there is only one nontrivial feasible computation order, and thus the total amount and a bound on the memory needed for infer-ence on compute graph G can be simplified:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M (G) = max op∈G   A∈op inp |A| + B∈op out |B| + |op|   (2)</formula><p>Or to restate, the amount of memory is simply the maximum total size of combined inputs and outputs across all operations. In what follows we show that if we treat a bottleneck residual block as a single operation (and treat inner convolution as a disposable tensor), the total amount of memory would be dominated by the size of bottleneck tensors, rather than the size of tensors that are internal to bottleneck (and much larger). For our networks N = ReLU6 • dwise • ReLU6 , but the results apply to any per-channel transformation. Suppose the size of the input domain is |x| and the size of the output domain is |y|, then the memory required to compute F (X) can be as low as |s 2 k| + |s 2 k | + O(max(s 2 , s 2 )).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bottleneck Residual Block</head><p>The algorithm is based on the fact that the inner tensor I can be represented as concatenation of t tensors, of size n/t each and our function can then be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">F(x) = t i=1 (A i • N • B i )(x)</formula><p>by accumulating the sum, we only require one intermediate block of size n/t to be kept in memory at all times. Using n = t we end up having to keep only a single channel of the intermediate representation at all times. The two constraints that enabled us to use this trick is (a) the fact that the inner transformation (which includes non-linearity and depthwise) is per-channel, and (b) the consecutive non-per-channel operators have significant ratio of the input size to the output. For most of the traditional neural networks, such trick would not produce a significant improvement.</p><p>We note that, the number of multiply-adds operators needed to compute F (X) using t-way split is independent of t, however in existing implementations we find that replacing one matrix multiplication with several smaller ones hurts runtime performance due to in-    creased cache misses. We find that this approach is the most helpful to be used with t being a small constant between 2 and 5. It significantly reduces the memory requirement, but still allows one to utilize most of the efficiencies gained by using highly optimized matrix multiplication and convolution operators provided by deep learning frameworks. It remains to be seen if special framework level optimization may lead to further runtime improvements.</p><p>6. Experiments</p></div>

We denote by output stride the ratio of input image spatial resolution to final output resolution, which is controlled by applying the atrous convolution properly. For semantic segmentation, we usually employ output stride = 16 or 8 for denser feature maps. We conduct the experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with extra annotated images from <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> and evaluation metric mIOU.</p><p>To build a mobile model, we experimented with three design variations: (1) different feature extractors, (2) simplifying the DeepLabv3 heads for faster computation, and (3) different inference strategies for boosting the performance. Our results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>. We have observed that: (a) the inference strategies, including multi-scale inputs and adding leftright flipped images, significantly increase the MAdds and thus are not suitable for on-device applications, (b) using output stride = 16 is more efficient than output stride = 8, (c) MobileNetV1 is already a powerful feature extractor and only requires about 4.9 − 5.7 times fewer MAdds than ResNet-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> (e.g., mIOU: 78.56 vs 82.70, and MAdds: 941.9B vs 4870.6B), (d) it is more efficient to build DeepLabv3 heads on top of the second last feature map of MobileNetV2 than on the original last-layer feature map, since the second to last feature map contains 320 channels instead of 1280, and by doing so, we attain similar performance, but require about 2.5 times fewer operations than the MobileNetV1 counterparts, and (e) DeepLabv3 heads are computationally expensive and removing the ASPP module significantly reduces the MAdds with only a slight performance degradation. In the end of the <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>, we identify a potential candidate for on-device applications (in bold face), which attains 75.32% mIOU and only requires 2.75B MAdds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>We described a very simple network architecture that allowed us to build a family of highly efficient mobile models. Our basic building unit, has several properties that make it particularly suitable for mobile applications. It allows very memory-efficient inference and relies utilize standard operations present in all neural frameworks.</p><p>For the ImageNet dataset, our architecture improves the state of the art for wide range of performance points.</p><p>For object detection task, our network outperforms state-of-art realtime detectors on COCO dataset both in terms of accuracy and model complexity.

Exploring this is an important direction for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Bottleneck transformation</head><p>In this section we study the properties of an operator A ReLU(Bx), where x ∈ R n represents an n-channel pixel, B is an m × n matrix and A is an n × m matrix. We argue that if m ≤ n, transformations of this form can only exploit non-linearity at the cost of losing information. In contrast, if n m, such transforms can be highly non-linear but still invertible with high probability (for the initial random weights).</p><p>First we show that ReLU is an identity transformation for any point that lies in the interior of its image.</p><p>Lemma 1 Let S(X) = {ReLU(x)|x ∈ X}. If a volume of S(X) is non-zero, then interior S(X) ⊆ X.</p><p>Proof: Let S = interior ReLU(S). First we note that if x ∈ S , then x i &gt; 0 for all i. Indeed, image of ReLU does not contain points with negative coordinates, and points with zero-valued coordinates can not be interior points. Therefore for each x ∈ S , x = ReLU(x) as desired.</p><p>It follows that for an arbitrary composition of interleaved linear transformation and ReLU operators, if it preserves non-zero volume, that part of the input space X that is preserved over such a composition is a linear transformation, and thus is likely to be a minor contributor to the power of deep networks. However, this is a fairly weak statement. Indeed, if the input manifold can be embedded into (n − 1)-dimensional manifold (out of n dimensions total), the lemma is trivially true, since the starting volume is 0. In what follows we show that when the dimensionality of input manifold is significantly lower we can ensure that there will be no information loss.</p><p>Since the ReLU(x) nonlinearity is a surjective function mapping the entire ray x ≤ 0 to 0, using this nonlinearity in a neural network can result in information loss. Once ReLU collapses a subset of the input manifold to a smaller-dimensional output, the following network layers can no longer distinguish between collapsed input samples. In the following, we show that bottlenecks with sufficiently large expansion layers are resistant to information loss caused by the presence of ReLU activation functions.</p><p>Lemma 2 (Invertibility of ReLU) Consider an operator ReLU(Bx), where B is an m × n matrix and x ∈ R n . Let y 0 = ReLU(Bx 0 ) for some x 0 ∈ R n , then equation y 0 = ReLU(Bx) has a unique solution with respect to x if and only if y 0 has at least n non-zero values and there are n linearly independent rows of B that correspond to non-zero coordinates of y 0 .</p><p>Proof: Denote the set of non-zero coordinates of y 0 as T and let y T and B T be restrictions of y and B to the subspace defined by T . If |T | &lt; n, we have y T = B T x 0 where B T is under-determined with at least one solution x 0 , thus there are infinitely many solutions. Now consider the case of |T | ≥ n and let the rank of B T be n. Suppose there is an additional solution x 1 = x 0 such that y 0 = ReLU(Bx 1 ), then we have y T = B T x 0 = B T x 1 , which cannot be satisfied unless</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x 0 = x 1 .</formula><p>One of the corollaries of this lemma says that if m n, we only need a small fraction of values of Bx to be positive for ReLU(Bx) to be invertible.</p><p>The constraints of the lemma 2 can be empirically validated for real networks and real inputs and hence we can be assured that information is indeed preserved. We further show that with respect to initialization, we can be sure that these constraints are satisfied with high probability. Note that for random initialization the conditions of lemma 2 are satisfied due to initialization symmetries. However even for trained graphs these constraints can be empirically validated by running the network over valid inputs and verifying that all or most inputs are above the threshold. On <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we show how this distribution looks for different MobileNetV2 layers. At step 0 the activation patterns concentrate around having half of the positive channel (as predicted by initialization symmetries). For fully trained network, while the standard deviation grew significantly, all but the two layers are still above the invertibility thresholds. We believe further study of this is warranted and might lead to helpful insights on network design. Then, the average n-volume of the subset of S that is collapsed by f B to a lower-dimensional manifold is Also notice that the intersection of BS with R m \(∪ σ Q σ ) is almost surely (n − 1)-dimensional. The average n-volume of S that is not collapsed by applying ReLU to BS is therefore given by:  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Distribution of activation patterns. The x-axis is the layer index, and we show minimum/maximum/average number of positive channels after each convolution with ReLU. y-axis is either absolute or relative number of channels. The "threshold" line indicates the ReLU invertibility threshold -that is the number of positive dimensions is higher than the input space. In our case this is 1/6 fraction of the channels. Note how at the beginning of the training on <ref type="figure">Figure 7a</ref> the distribution is much more tightly concentrated around the mean. After the training has finished <ref type="figure">(Figure 7b</ref>), the average hasn't changed but the standard deviation grew dramatically. Best viewed in color. and therefore ReLU(Bx) performs a nonlinear transformation while preserving information with high probability. We discussed how bottlenecks can prevent manifold collapse, but increasing the size of the bottleneck expansion may also make it possible for the network to represent more complex functions. Following the main results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, one can show, for example, that for any integer L ≥ 1 and p &gt; 1 there exist a network of L ReLU layers, each containing n neurons and a bottleneck expansion of size pn such that it maps p nL input volumes (linearly isomorphic to [0, 1] n ) to the same output region [0, 1] n . Any complex possibly nonlinear function attached to the network output would thus effectively compute function values for p nL input linear regions. </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V − N m,n V 2 m , where V = vol S and</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ∈Σn E B [V σ (B)],<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
