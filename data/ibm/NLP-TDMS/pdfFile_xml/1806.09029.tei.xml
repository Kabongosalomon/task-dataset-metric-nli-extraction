				<p>To be informative, an evaluation must measure how well systems generalize to realistic unseen data. We identify limitations of and propose improvements to current evaluations of text-to-SQL systems. First, we compare human-generated and automatically generated questions, characterizing properties of queries necessary for real-world applications. To facilitate evaluation on multiple datasets, we release standardized and improved versions of seven existing datasets and one new text-to-SQL dataset. Second, we show that the current division of data into training and test sets measures robustness to variations in the way questions are asked, but only partially tests how well systems generalize to new queries; therefore, we propose a complementary dataset split for evaluation of future work. Finally, we demonstrate how the common practice of anonymiz-ing variables during evaluation removes an important challenge of the task. Our observations highlight key difficulties, and our methodology enables effective measurement of future development.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Effective natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) would give lay people access to vast amounts of data stored in relational databases. This paper identifies key oversights in current evaluation methodology for this task. In the process, we (1) introduce a new, challenging dataset, (2) standardize and fix many errors in existing datasets, and (3) propose a simple yet effective baseline system. 1 * The first two authors contributed equally to this work. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Code and data is available at https://github. com/jkkummerfeld/text2sql-data/ <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Traditional question-based splits allow queries to appear in both train and test. Our querybased split ensures each query is in only one.</p><p>First, we consider query complexity, showing that human-written questions require more complex queries than automatically generated ones. To illustrate this challenge, we introduce Advising, a dataset of questions from university students about courses that lead to particularly complex queries.</p><p>Second, we identify an issue in the way examples are divided into training and test sets. The standard approach, shown at the top of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, divides examples based on the text of each question. As a result, many of the queries in the test set are seen in training, albeit with different entity names and with the question phrased differently. This means metrics are mainly measuring robustness to the way a set of known SQL queries can be expressed in English-still a difficult problem, but not a complete test of ability to compose new queries in a familiar domain. We introduce a template-based slot-filling baseline that cannot generalize to new queries, and yet is competitive with prior work on multiple datasets. To measure robustness to new queries, we propose splitting based on the SQL query. We show that stateof-the-art systems with excellent performance on traditional question-based splits struggle on querybased splits. We also consider the common practice of variable anonymization, which removes a challenging form of ambiguity from the task. In the process, we apply extensive effort to standardize datasets and fix a range of errors.</p><p>Previous NLIDB work has led to impressive systems, but current evaluations provide an incomplete picture of their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we provide new and improved data, a new baseline, and guidelines that complement existing metrics, supporting future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The task of generating SQL representations from English questions has been studied in the NLP and DB communities since the 1970s ( <ref type="bibr">Androutsopou- los et al., 1995)</ref>. Our observations about evaluation methodology apply broadly to the systems cited below.</p><p>Within the DB community, systems commonly use pattern matching, grammar-based techniques, or intermediate representations of the query (Pazos <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rangel et al., 2013)</ref>. Recent work has explored incorporating user feedback to improve accuracy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li and Jagadish, 2014</ref>). Unfortunately, none of these systems are publicly available, and many rely on domain-specific resources.</p><p>In the NLP community, there has been extensive work on semantic parsing to logical representations that query a knowledge base <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltagy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berant and Liang, 2014)</ref>, while work on mapping to SQL has recently increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Yih et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Iyer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhong et al., 2017)</ref>. One of the earliest statistical models for mapping text to SQL was the PRECISE system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Popescu et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Popescu et al., , 2004</ref>), which achieved high precision on queries that met constraints linking tokens and database values, attributes, and relations, but did not attempt to generate SQL for questions outside this class. Later work considered generating queries based on relations extracted by a syntactic parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Giordani and Moschitti, 2012</ref>) and applying techniques from logical parsing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Poon, 2013)</ref>. However, none of these earlier systems are publicly available, and some required extensive engineering effort for each domain, such as the lexicon used by PRECISE.</p><p>More recent work has produced general purpose systems that are competitive with previous results and are also available, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Iyer et al. (2017)</ref>. We also adapt a logical form parser with a sequence to tree approach that makes very few assumptions about the output structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dong and Lapata, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>One challenge for applying neural models to this task is annotating large enough datasets of question-query pairs. Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cai et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zhong et al., 2017</ref>) has automatically generated large datasets using templates to form random queries and corresponding natural-languagelike questions, and then having humans rephrase the question into English. Another option is to use feedback-based learning, where the system alternates between training and making predictions, which a user rates as correct or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Iyer et al., 2017)</ref>. Other work seeks to avoid the data bottleneck by using end-to-end approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Yin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Neelakantan et al., 2017)</ref>, which we do not consider here. One key contribution of this paper is standardization of a range of datasets, to help address the challenge of limited data resources.</p></div>

Some questions were collected from the EECS department Facebook page and others were written by CS students with knowledge of the database who were instructed to write questions they might ask in an academic advising appointment.</p><p>The authors manually labeled the initial set of questions with SQL. To ensure high quality, at least two annotators scored each questionquery pair on a two-point scale for accuracydid the query generate an accurate answer to the question?-and a three-point scale for helpfulness-did the answer provide the information the asker was probably seeking? Cases with low scores were fixed or removed from the dataset.</p><p>We collected paraphrases using <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jiang et al. (2017)</ref>'s method, with manual inspection to ensure accuracy. For a given sentence, this produced paraphrases with the same named entities (e.g. course number EECS 123). To add variation, we annotated entities in the questions and queries with their types-such as course name, department, or instructor-and substituted randomly-selected values of each type into each paraphrase and its corresponding query. This combination of paraphrasing and entity replacement means an original question of "For next semester, who is teaching EECS 123?" can give rise to "Who teaches MATH 456 next semester?" as well as "Who's the professor for next semester's CHEM 789?" capitalization and spaces between symbols. We confirmed these changes do not alter the meaning of the queries via unit tests of the canonicalization code and manual inspection of the output. We also manually fixed some errors, such as ambiguous mixing of AND and OR (30 ATIS queries).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Variable Annotation</head><p>Existing SQL datasets do not explicitly identify which words in the question are used in the SQL query. Automatic methods to identify these variables, as used in prior work, do not account for ambiguities, such as words that could be either a city or an airport. To provide accurate anonymization, we annotated query variables using a combination of automatic and manual processing. Our automatic process extracted terms from each side of comparison operations in SQL: one side contains quoted text or numbers, and the other provides a type for those literals. Often quoted text in the query is a direct copy from the question, while in some cases we constructed dictionaries to map common acronyms, like american airlines-AA, and times, like 2pm-1400. The process flagged cases with ambiguous mappings, which we then manually processed. Often these were mistakes, which we corrected, such as missing constraints (e.g., papers in 2015 with no date limit in the query), extra constraints (e.g., limiting to a single airline despite no mention in the question), inaccurate constraints (e.g., more than 5 as &gt; 4), and inconsistent use of this year to mean different years in different queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Query Deduplication</head><p>Three of the datasets had many duplicate queries (i.e., semantically equivalent questions with different SQL). To avoid this spurious ambiguity we manually grouped the data into sets of equivalent questions <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. A second person manually inspected every set and ran the queries. Where multiple queries are valid, we kept them all, though only used the first for the rest of this work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluating on Multiple Datasets Is Necessary</head><p>For evaluation to be informative it must use data that is representative of real-world queries. If datasets have biases, robust comparisons of models will require evaluation on multiple datasets. For example, some datasets, such as ATIS and Advising, were collected from users and are taskoriented, while others, such as WikiSQL, were produced by automatically generating queries and engaging people to express the query in language. If these two types of datasets differ systematically, evaluation on one may not reflect performance on the other. In this section, we provide descriptive statistics aimed at understanding how several datasets differ, especially with respect to query redundancy and complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measures</head><p>We consider a range of measures that capture different aspects of data complexity and diversity:</p><p>Question / Unique Query Counts We measure dataset size and how many distinct queries there are when variables are anonymized. We also present the mean number of questions per unique query; a larger mean indicates greater redundancy.</p><p>SQL Patterns Complexity can be described as the answer to the question, "How many queryform patterns would be required to generate this dataset?" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> shows an example of a pattern, which essentially abstracts away from the specific table and field names. Some datasets were generated from patterns similar to these, including WikiSQL and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cai et al. (2017)</ref>. This enables the generation of large numbers of queries, but limits the SELECT &lt;table-alias&gt;.&lt;field&gt; FROM &lt;table&gt; AS &lt;table-alias&gt; WHERE &lt;table-alias&gt;.&lt;field&gt; = &lt;literal&gt; SELECT RIVERalias0.RIVER NAME FROM RIVER AS RIVERalias0 WHERE RIVERalias0.TRAVERSE = "florida";</p><p>SELECT CITYalias0.CITY NAME FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.STATE NAME = "alabama"; variation between them to only that encompassed by their patterns. We count the number of patterns needed to cover the full dataset, where larger numbers indicate greater diversity. We also report mean queries per pattern; here, larger numbers indicate greater redundancy, showing that many queries fit the same mold.</p><p>Counting <ref type="table">Tables We consider the total number</ref> of tables and the number of unique tables mentioned in a query. These numbers differ in the event of self-joins. In both cases, higher values imply greater complexity.</p><p>Nesting A query with nested subqueries may be more complex than one without nesting. We count SELECT statements within each query to determine the number of sub-queries. We also report the depth of query nesting. In both cases, higher values imply greater complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis</head><p>The statistics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> show several patterns. First, dataset size is not the best indicator of dataset diversity. Although WikiSQL contains fifteen times as many question-query pairs as ATIS, ATIS contains significantly more patterns than WikiSQL; moreover, WikiSQL's queries are dominated by one pattern that is more than half of the dataset (SELECT col AS result FROM table WHERE col = value). The small, hand-curated datasets developed by the database communityAcademic, IMDB, and Yelp-have noticeably less redundancy as measured by questions per unique query and queries per pattern than the datasets the NLP community typically evaluates on.</p><p>Second, human-generated datasets exhibit greater complexity than automatically generated data. All of the human-generated datasets except Yelp demonstrate at least some nesting. The average query from any of the human-generated datasets joins more than one table.</p><p>In particular, task-oriented datasets require joins and nesting. ATIS and Advising, which were developed with air-travel and student-advising tasks in mind, respectively, both score in the top three for multiple complexity scores.</p><p>To accurately predict performance on humangenerated or task-oriented questions, it is thus necessary to evaluate on datasets that test the ability to handle nesting and joins. Training and testing NLP systems, particularly deep learning-based methods, benefits from large datasets. However, at present, the largest dataset available does not provide the desired complexity.</p><p>Takeaway: Evaluate on multiple datasets, some with nesting and joins, to provide a thorough picture of a system's strengths and weaknesses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Current Data Splits Only Partially Probe Generalizability</head><p>It is standard best practice in machine learning to divide data into disjoint training, development, and test sets. Otherwise, evaluation on the test set will not accurately measure how well a model generalizes to new examples. The standard splits of GeoQuery, ATIS, and Scholar treat each pair of a natural language question and its SQL query as a single item. Thus, as long as each question-query pair appears in only one set, the test set is not tainted with training data. We call this a questionbased data split. However, many English questions may correspond to the same SQL query. If at least one copy of every SQL query appears in training, then the task evaluated is classification, not true semantic parsing, of the English questions. We can increase the number of distinct SQL queries by varying what entities our questions ask about; the queries for what states border Texas and what states border Massachusetts are not identical. Adding this variation changes the task from pure classification to classification plus slot-filling. Does this provide a true evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen inputs?</p><p>It depends on what we wish to evaluate. If we want a system that answers questions within a particular domain, and we have a dataset that we are confident covers everything a user might want to know about that domain, then evaluating on the traditional question-based split tells us whether the system is robust to variation in how a request is expressed. But compositionality is an essential part of language, and a system that has trained on What courses does Professor Smith teach? and What courses meet on Fridays? should be prepared for What courses that Professor Smith teaches meet on Fridays? Evaluation on the question split does not tell us about a model's generalizable knowledge of SQL, or even its generalizable knowledge within the present domain.</p><p>To evaluate the latter, we propose a complementary new division, where no SQL query is allowed to appear in more than one set; we call this the query split. To generate a query split, we substitute variables for entities in each query in the dataset, as described in § 3.2. Queries that are identical when thus anonymized are treated as a single query and randomly assigned-with all their accompanying questions-to train, dev, or test. We include the original question split and the new query split labeling for the new Advising dataset, as well as ATIS, GeoQuery, and Scholar. For the much smaller Academic, IMDB, Restaurant, and Yelp datasets, we include question-and query-based buckets for cross validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Systems</head><p>Recently, a great deal of work has used variations on the seq2seq model. We compare performance of a basic seq2seq model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>), and seq2seq with attention over the input (Bahdanau et al., 2015), implemented with TensorFlow seq2seq ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Britz et al., 2017</ref>). We also extend that model to include an attention-based copying option, similar to Jia and Liang (2016). Our output vocabulary for the decoder includes a special token, COPY. If COPY has the highest probability at step t, we replace it with the input token with the   max of the normalized attention scores. Our loss function is the sum of two terms: first, the categorical cross entropy for the model's probability distribution over the output vocabulary tokens; and second, the loss for word copying. When the correct output token is COPY, the second loss term is the categorical cross entropy of the distribution of attention scores at time t. Otherwise it is zero. For comparison, we include systems from two recent papers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dong and Lapata (2016)</ref> used an attention-based seq2tree model for semantic parsing of logical forms; we apply their code here to SQL datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Iyer et al. (2017)</ref> use a seq2seq model with automatic dataset expansion through paraphrasing and SQL templates. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We could not find publicly available code for the non-neural text-to-SQL systems discussed in Section 2. Also, most of those approaches require development of specialized grammars or templates for each new dataset they are applied to, so we do not compare such systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">New Template Baseline</head><p>In addition to the seq2seq models, we develop a new baseline system for text-to-SQL parsing which exploits repetitiveness in data. First, we automatically generate SQL templates from the training set. The system then makes two predictions: (1) which template to use, and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> which words in the sentence should fill slots in the template. This system is not able to generalize beyond the queries in the training set, so it will fail completely on the new query-split data setting. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> presents the overall architecture, which we implemented in DyNet ( <ref type="bibr">Neubig et al., 2017)</ref>. A bidirectional LSTM provides a prediction for each word, either O if the word is not used in the final query, or a symbol such as city1 to indicate that it fills a slot. The hidden states of the LSTM at each end of the sentence are passed through a small feed-forward network to determine the SQL template to use. This architecture is simple and enables a joint choice of the tags and the template, though we do not explicitly enforce agreement.</p><p>To train the model, we automatically construct a set of templates and slots. Slots are determined based on the variables in the dataset, with each SQL variable that is explicitly given in the question becoming a slot. We can construct these templates because our new version of the data explicitly defines all variables, their values, and where they appear in both question and query.</p><p>For completeness, we also report on an oracle version of the template-based system (performance if it always chose the correct template from the train set and filled all slots correctly).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Oracle Entity Condition</head><p>Some systems, such as Dong and Lapata's model, are explicitly designed to work on anonymized data (i.e., data where entity names are replaced with a variable indicating their type). Others, such as attention-based copying models, treat identification of entities as an inextricable component of the text-to-SQL task. We therefore describe results on both the actual datasets with entities in place and a version anonymized using the variables described in § 3.2. We refer to the latter as the oracle entity condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Results and Analysis</head><p>We hypothesized that even a system unable to generalize can achieve good performance on questionbased splits of datasets, and the results in Table 3 substantiate that for the NLP community's datasets. The template-based, slot-filling baseline was competitive with state-of-the-art systems for question split on the four datasets from the NLP community. The template-based oracle performance indicates that for these datasets anywhere from 70-100% accuracy on question-based split could be obtained by selecting a template from the training set and filling in the right slots.</p><p>For the three datasets developed by the databases community, the effect of question-query split is far less pronounced. The small sizes of these datasets cannot account for the difference, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Variable Anonymization  Baseline  80  0  46  0  57  0  95  0  52  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  seq2seq  6  0  8  0  27  7  47  0  19  0  6  7  1  0  0  0  + Attention  29  0  46 18  63 21  100  2  33  0  71 64  7  3  2  2  + Copying  70  0  51 32  71 20  100  4  59  5  81 74  26  9  12  4  D&amp;L seq2tree  46  2  46 23  62 31  100 11  44  6  63 54  6  2  1  2  Iyer et</ref>  since even the oracle baseline did not have much success on these question splits, and since the baseline was able to handle the small Restaurants dataset. Looking back at Section 4, however, we see that these are the datasets with the least redundancy in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.

IMDB and Yelp both show weak results on query split despite their low redundancy. Experiments on a non-redundant version of query split for Advising, ATIS, GeoQuery, and Restaurant that contained only one question for each query confirmed this: in each case, accuracy remained the same or declined relative to regular query split.</p><p>Having ruled out redundancy as a cause for the exceptional performance on Academic's query split, we suspect the simplicity of its questions and the compositionality of its queries may be responsible. Every question in the dataset begins return me followed by a phrase indicating the desired field, optionally followed by one or more constraints; for instance, return me the papers by 'author name0' and return me the papers by 'author name0' on journal name0.</p><p>None of this, of course, is to suggest that question-based split is an easy problem, even on the NLP community's datasets. Except for the Advising and Restaurants datasets, even the oracle version of the template-based system is far from perfect. Access to oracle entities helps performance of non-copying systems substantially, as we would expect. Entity matching is thus a nontrivial component of the task.</p><p>But the query-based split is certainly more difficult than the question-based split. Across datasets and systems, performance suffered on query split. Access to oracle entities did not remove this effect.</p><p>Many of the seq2seq models do show some ability to generalize, though. Unlike the templatebased baseline, many were able to eek out some performance on query split.</p><p>On question split, ATIS is the most difficult of the NLP datasets, yet on query split, it is among the easiest. To understand this apparent contradiction, we must consider what kinds of mistakes systems make and the contexts in which they appear. We therefore analyze the output of the attentionbased-copying model in greater detail.</p><p>We categorize each output as shown in column one of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The "Correct" category is selfexplanatory. "Entity problem only" means that the query would have been correct but for a mistake in one or more entity names. "Different template" means that the system output was the same as another query from the dataset but for the entity names; however, it did not match the correct query for this question. "No template match" contains both the most mundane and the most interesting errors. Here, the system output a query that is not copied from training data. <ref type="bibr">Sometimes,</ref>   segments of queries it has seen into new queries. This is necessary but not sufficient model behavior in order to do well on the query split. In at least one case, this category includes a semantically equivalent query marked as incorrect by the exact-match accuracy metric. 3 <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows the number of examples from the test set that fell into each category, as well as the mean length of gold queries ("length") for each category. Short queries are easier than long ones in the question-based condition. In most cases, length in "correct" is shorter than length in either "different template" or "no template match" categories.</p><p>In addition, for short queries, the model seems to prefer to copy a query it has seen before; for longer ones, it generates a new query. In every case but one, mean length in "different template" is less than in "No template match."</p><p>Interestingly, in ATIS and GeoQuery, where the model performs tolerably well on query split, the length for correct queries in query split is higher than the length for correct queries from the question split. Since, as noted above, recombination of template pieces (as we see in "no template match") is a necessary step for success on query split, it may be that longer queries have a higher probability of recombination, and therefore a better chance of being correct in query split. The data from Scholar does not support this position; however, note that only 17 queries were correct in Scholar query split, suggesting caution in making generalizations from this set.</p><p>These results also seem to indicate that our copying mechanism effectively deals with entity identification. Across all datasets, we see only a small number of entity-problem-only examples. However, comparing the rows from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 3</ref> for seq2seq+Copy at the top and seq2seq+Attention in the oracle entities condition, it is clear that having oracle entities provides a useful signal, with consistent gains in performance.</p><p>Takeaways: Evaluate on both question-based and query-based dataset splits. Additionally, variable anonymization noticeably decreases the difficulty of the task; thus, thorough evaluations should include results on datasets without anonymization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Logic Variants</head><p>To see if our observations on query and question split performance apply beyond SQL, we also considered the logical form annotations for ATIS and GeoQuery <ref type="bibr">Collins, 2005, 2007)</ref>. We retrained Jia and Liang (2016)'s baseline and full system. Interestingly, we founnd limited impact on performance, measured with either logical forms or denotations. To understand why, we inspected the logical form datasets. In both ATIS and GeoQuery, the logical form version has a larger set of queries after variable identification. This seems to be because the logic abstracts away from the surface form less than SQL does. For example, these questions have the same SQL in our data, but different logical forms: what state has the largest capital Other examples include variation in the logical form between sentences with largest and largest population even though the associated dataset only has population figures for cities (not area or any other measure of size). Similarly in ATIS, the logical form will add (flight $0) if the question mentions flights explicitly, making these two queries different, even though they convey the same user intent:</p><p>what flights do you have from bwi to sfo i need a reservation from bwi to sfo By being closer to a syntactic representation, the queries end up being more compositional, which encourages the model to learn more compositionality than the SQL models do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we identify two issues in current datasets for mapping questions to SQL queries. First, by analyzing question and query complexity we find that human-written datasets require properties that have not yet been included in large-scale automatically generated query sets. Second, we show that the generalizability of systems is overstated by the traditional data splits. In the process we also identify and fix hundreds of mistakes across multiple datasets and homogenize the SQL query structures to enable effective multi-domain experiments.</p><p>Our analysis has clear implications for future work. Evaluating on multiple datasets is necessary to ensure coverage of the types of questions humans generate. Developers of future large-scale datasets should incorporate joins and nesting to create more human-like data. And new systems should be evaluated on both question-and querybased splits, guiding the development of truly general systems for mapping natural language to structured database queries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: An SQL pattern and example queries.</figDesc></figure>
