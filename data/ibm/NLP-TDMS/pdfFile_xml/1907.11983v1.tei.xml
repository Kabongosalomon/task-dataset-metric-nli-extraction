<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Commonsense reasoning is fundamental to natural language understanding (NLU). As shown in the examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, in order to infer what the pronoun "they" refers to in the first two statements, one has to leverage the commonsense knowledge that "demonstrators usually cause violence and city councilmen usually fear violence." Similarly, it is obvious to humans what the pronoun "it" refers to in the third and fourth statements due to the commonsense knowledge that "An object cannot fit in a container because either the object (trophy) is too big or the container (suitcase) is too small."</p><p>In this paper, we study two classic commonsense reasoning tasks: the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) and Pronoun Disambiguation Problem (PDP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Levesque et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Davis and Marcus, 2015)</ref>. Both tasks are formulated as an anaphora resolution problem, which is a form of co-reference resolution, where a machine (AI agent) must identify the antecedent of an ambiguous pronoun in a statement. WSC and PDP differ from other co-reference resolution tasks <ref type="bibr">(Soon et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ng and Cardie, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Peng et al., 2016)</ref> in that commonsense knowledge, which cannot be explicitly decoded from the given text, is needed to solve the problem, as illustrated in the examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Comparing with other commonsense reasoning tasks, such as COPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Roemmele et al., 2011)</ref>, Story Cloze Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mostafazadeh et al., 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Event2Mind (Rashkin et al., 2018)</ref>, SWAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zellers et al., 2018)</ref>, ReCoRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>, and so on, WSC and PDP better approximate real human reasoning, can be easily solved by native English-speaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Levesque et al., 2011)</ref>, and yet are challenging for machines. For example, the WNLI task, which is derived from WSC, is considered the most challenging NLU task in the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. Most machine learning models can hardly outperform the naive baseline of majority voting (scored at 65.1) 1 , including BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Devlin et al., 2018a)</ref> and Distilled MT-DNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Liu et al., 2019a)</ref>.</p><p>While traditional methods of commonsense reasoning rely heavily on human-crafted features and knowledge bases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rahman and Ng, 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sharma et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schüller, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bailey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liu et al., 2017)</ref>, we explore in this study machine learning approaches using deep neural networks (DNN). Our method is inspired by two categories of DNN models proposed recently.</p><p>The first are neural language models trained on large amounts of text data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Trinh and Le (2018)</ref> proposed to use a neural language model trained on raw text from books and news to calculate the probabilities of the natural language sentences which are constructed from a statement by replacing the to-be-resolved pronoun in the statement with each of its candidate references (antecedent), and then pick the candidate with the highest probability as the answer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kocijan et al. (2019)</ref> showed that a significant improvement can be achieved by fine-tuning a pre-trained masked language model (BERT in their case) on a small amount of WSC labeled data.</p><p>The second category of models are semantic similarity models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang et al. (2019)</ref> formulated WSC and PDP as a semantic matching problem, and proposed to use two variations of the Deep Structured Similarity Model (DSSM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Huang et al., 2013)</ref> to compute the semantic similarity score between each candidate antecedent and the pronoun by (1) mapping the candidate and the pronoun and their context into two vectors, respectively, in a hidden space using deep neural networks, and (2) computing cosine similarity between the two vectors. The candidate with the highest score is selected as the result.</p><p>The two categories of models use different inductive biases when predicting outputs given inputs, and thus capture different views of the data. While language models measure the semantic co-herence and wholeness of a statement where the pronoun to be resolved is replaced with its candidate antecedent, DSSMs measure the semantic relatedness of the pronoun and its candidate in their context. Therefore, inspired by multi-task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Caruana, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., , 2019b</ref>, we propose a hybrid neural network (HNN) model that combines the strengths of both neural language models and a semantic similarity model. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, HNN consists of two component models, a masked language model and a deep semantic similarity model. The two component models share the same text encoder (BERT), but use different model-specific input and output layers. The final output score is the combination of the two model scores. The architecture of HNN bears a strong resemblance to that of Multi-Task Deep Neural Network (MT-DNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Liu et al., 2019b)</ref>, which consists of a BERT-based text encoder that is shared across all tasks (models) and a set of task (model) specific output layers. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Liu et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kocijan et al., 2019)</ref>, the training procedure of HNN consists of two steps:</p><p>(1) pretraining the text encoder on raw text 2 , and (2) multi-task learning of HNN on WSCR which is the most popular WSC dataset, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kocijan et al.

We also conduct an ablation study which shows that language models and semantic similarity models provide complementary approaches to commonsense reasoning, and HNN effectively combines the strengths of both.</p></div>

The final output score, which indicates whether C is the correct candidate of the pronoun in S, is the combination of the two component model scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Masked Language Model (MLM)</head><p>This component model follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kocijan et al. (2019)</ref>. In the input layer, a masked sentence is constructed using S by replacing the to-beresolved pronoun in S with a sequence of N [MASK] tokens, where N is the number of tokens in candidate C.</p><p>In the output layer, the likelihood of C being referred to by the pronoun in S is scored using the BERT-based masked language model P mlm (C|S). If C = {c 1 ...c N } consists of multiple tokens, log P mlm (C|S) is computed as the average of logprobabilities of each composing token:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P mlm (C|S) = exp 1 N k=1...N log P mlm (c k |S) .</formula><p>(1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Semantic Similarity Model (SSM)</head><p>In the input layer, we treat sentence S and candidate C as a pair (S, C) that is packed together as a word sequence, where we add the [CLS] token as the first token and the [SEP] token between S and C. After applying the shared embedding layers, we obtain the semantic representations of S and C, denoted as s ∈ R d and c ∈ R d , respectively. We use the contextual embedding of [CLS] as s. Suppose C consists of N tokens, whose contextual embeddings are h 1 , ..., h N , respectively. The semantic representation of the candidate C, c, is computed via attention as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α k = softmax( s W 1 h k √ d ),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">c = k=1...N α k · h k .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where W 1 is a learnable parameter matrix, and α is the attention score. We use the contextual embedding of the first token of the pronoun in S as the semantic representation of the pronoun, denoted as p ∈ R d . In the output layer, the semantic similarity between the pronoun and the context is computed using a bilinear model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Sim(C, S) = p W 2 c,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where W 2 is a learnable parameter matrix. Then, SSM predicts whether C is a correct candidate (i.e., (C, S) is a positive pair, labeled as y = 1) using the logistic function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P ssm (y = 1|C, S) = 1 1 + exp (−Sim(C, S))</formula><p>.</p><p>(5) The final output score of pair (S, C) is a linear combination of the MLM score of Eqn. 1 and the SSM score of Eqn. 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Score(C, S) = 1 2 [P mlm (C|S)+P ssm (y = 1|C, S)].<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The Training Procedure</head><p>We train our model of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> on the WSCR dataset, which consists of 1886 sentences, each being paired with a positive candidate antecedent and a negative candidate. The shared BERT encoder is initialized using the published BERT uncased large model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Devlin et al., 2018a)</ref>. We then finetune the model on the WSCR dataset by optimizing the combined objectives:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L mlm + L ssm + L rank ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where L mlm is the negative log-likelihood based on the masked language model of Eqn. 1, and L ssm is the cross-entropy loss based on semantic similarity model of Eqn. 5. L rank is the pair-wise rank loss. Consider a sentence S which contains a pronoun to be resolved, and two candidates C + and C − , where C + is correct and C − is not. We want to maximize ∆ = Score(S, C + ) − Score(S, C − ), where Score(.) is defined by Eqn. 6. We achieve this via optimizing a smoothed rank loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L rank = log(1 + exp (−γ(∆ + β))),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where γ ∈ [1, 10] is the smoothing factor and β ∈ [0, 1] the margin hyperparameter. In our experiments, the default setting is γ = 10, and β = 0.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the proposed HNN on three commonsense benchmarks: WSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Levesque et al., 2012)</ref>, PDP60 5 and WNLI. WNLI is derived from WSC, and is considered the most challenging NLU task in the GLUE benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wang et al., 2018</ref>    <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rahman and Ng, 2012b)</ref> for model training and selection. WSCR contains 1886 instances (1322 for training and the rest as dev set). Each instance is presented using the same structure as that in WSC.</p><p>For the WNLI instances, we convert them to the format of WSC as illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: we first detect pronouns in the premise using spaCy 6 ; then given the detected pronoun, we search its left of the premise in hypothesis to find the longest common substring (LCS) ignoring character case. Similarly, we search its right part to the LCS; by comparing the indexes of the extracted LSCs, we extract the candidate. A detailed example of the conversion process is provided in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Implementation Detail</head><p>Our implementation of HNN is based on the Py-Torch implementation of BERT 7 . All the models are trained with hyper-parameters depicted as follows unless stated otherwise. The shared layer is initialized by the BERT uncased large model. Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kingma and Ba, 2014)</ref> is used as our optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 32 or 16. The learning rate is linearly decayed during training with 100 warm up steps. We select models based on the dev set by greedily searching epochs between 8 and 10. The trainable parameters, e.g., W 1 and W 2 , are initialized by a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Examples of transforming WNLI to WSC format. Note that the text highlighted by brown is the longest common substring from the left part of pronoun it, and the text highlighted by violet is the longest common substring from its right. standard deviation of 0.01. The margin hyperparameter, β in Eqn. 8, is set to 0.6 for MLM and 0.5 for SSM, and γ is set to 10 for all tasks. We also apply SWA <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Izmailov et al., 2018)</ref> to improve the generalization of models. All the texts are tokenized using WordPieces, and are chopped to spans containing 512 tokens at most.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>We compare our HNN with a list of state-of-the-art models in the literature, including BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Devlin et al., 2018b)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)</ref> and DSSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. The brief description of each baseline is introduced as follows.</p><p>1. BERT LARGE-LM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Devlin et al., 2018b)</ref>: This is the large BERT model, and we use MLM to predict a score for each candidate following Eq 1.</p><p>2. GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref>: During prediction, We first replace the pronoun in a given sentence with its candidates one by one. We use the GPT-2 model to compute a score for each new sentence after the replacement, and select the candidate with the highest score as the final prediction.</p><p>3. BERT Wiki-WSCR and BERT WSCR (Kocijan et al., 2019): These two models use the same approach as BERT LARGE-LM , but are trained with different additional training data. For example, BERT Wiki-WSCR is firstly fine-tuned on the constructed Wikipedia data and then on WSCR. BERT WSCR is directly fine-tuned on WSCR.</p><p>4. DSSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>: It is the unsupervised semantic matching model trained on the dataset generated with heuristic rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">HNN:</head><p>It is the proposed hybrid neural network model.</p><p>The main results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Compared with all the baselines, HNN obtains much better performance across three benchmarks. This clearly demonstrates the advantage of the HNN over existing models. For example, HNN outperforms the previous state-of-theart BERT Wiki-WSCR model with a 11.7% absolute improvement (83.6% vs 71.9%) on WNLI and a 2.8% absolute improvement (75.1% vs 72.2%) on WSC in terms of accuracy. Meanwhile, it achieves a 11.7% absolute improvement over the previous state-of-the-art BERT LARGE-LM model on PDP60 in accuracy. Note that both BERT Wiki-WSCR and BERT LARGE-LM are using language model-based approaches to solve the pronoun resolution problem. On the other hand, We observe that DSSM without pre-training is comparable to BERT LARGE-LM which is pre-trained on the large scale text corpus (63.0% vs 62.0% on WSC and 75.0% vs 78.3% on PDP60). Our results show that HNN, combining the strengths of both DSSM and BERT WSCR , has consistently achieved new state-of-the-art results on all three tasks. WNLI WSC PDP60 DSSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref> -63.0 75.0 BERT LARGE-LM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Devlin et al., 2018a)</ref> 65.1 62.0 78.3 GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> -70.7 -BERT Wiki-WSCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kocijan et al., 2019)</ref> 71.9 72.2 -BERT WSCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kocijan et al., 2019)</ref> 70.5 70.3 -HNN 83.6 75.1 90.0 HNN ensemble 89.0 --  To further boost the WNLI accuracy on the GLUE benchmark leaderboard, we record the model prediction at each epoch, and then produce the final prediction based on the majority voting from the last six model predictions. We refer to the ensemble of six models as HNN ensemble in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. HNN ensemble brings a 5.4% absolute improvement (89.0% vs 83.6%) on WNLI in terms of accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Ablation study</head><p>In this section, we study the importance of each component in HNN by answering following questions: How important are the two component models:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MLM and SSM?</head><p>To answer this question, we first remove each component model, either SSM or MLM, and then report the performance impact of these component models. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> summarizes the experimental results. It is expected that the removal of ei-ther component model results in a significant performance drop. For example, with the removal of SSM, the performance of HNN is downgraded from 77.1% to 74.5% on WNLI. Similarly, with the removal of MLM, HNN only obtains 75.1%, which amounts to a 2% drop. All these observations clearly demonstrate that SSM and MLM are complementary to each other and the HNN model benefits from the combination of both. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> gives several examples showing how SSM and MLM complement each other on WNLI. We see that in the first pair of examples, MLM correctly predicts the label while SSM does not. This is due to the fact that "the roof repaired" appears more frequently than "the tree repaired" in the text corpora used for model pre-training. However, in the second pair, since both "the demonstrators" and "the city councilment" could advocate violence and neither occurs significantly more often than the other, SSM is more effective in distinguishing the difference based on their context. The proposed HNN, which combines the strengths of these two models, can obtain the correct results in both cases. Does the additional ranking loss help?</p><p>As in Eqn. 7, the training objective of HNN model contains three losses. The first two are based on the two component models, respectively, and the third one, as defined in Eqn. 8, is a ranking loss based on the score function in Eqn. 6. At first glance, the ranking loss seems redundant. Thus, we compare two versions of HNN trained with and without the ranking loss. Experimental results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>. We see that without the ranking loss, the performance of HNN drops on three datasets: WNLI, WSCR and WSC. On the PDP60 dataset, without the ranking loss, the model performs slightly better. However, since the test set of PDP60 includes only 60 samples, the difference is not statistically significant. Thus, we decide to always include the ranking loss in the training objective of HNN.  Is the WNLI task a ranking or classification task? The WNLI task can be formulated as either a ranking task or a classification task. To study the difference in problem formulation, we conduct experiments to compare the performance of a model used as a classifier or a ranker. For example, given a trained HNN, when it is used as a classifier we set a threshold to decide label (0/1) for each input. When it is used as a ranker, we simply pick the top-ranked candidate as the correct answer. We run the comparison using all three models HNN, MLM and SSM. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>, the ranking formulation is consistently better than the classification formulation for this task. For example, the difference in the HNN model is about absolute 2.5% (74.6% vs 77.1%) in terms of accuracy.</p></div>
