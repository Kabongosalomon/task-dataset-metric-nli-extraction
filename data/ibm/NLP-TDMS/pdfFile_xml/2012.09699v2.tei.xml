<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs. 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>There has been a tremendous success in the field of natural language processing (NLP) since the development of Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref> which are currently the best performing neural network architectures for handling long-term sequential datasets such as sentences in NLP. This is achieved by the use of attention mechanism (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014) where a word in a sentence attends to each other word and combines the received information to generate its abstract feature representations. From a perspective of message-passing paradigm (Gilmer AAAI'21 Workshop on Deep Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications (DLG-AAAI'21).

All rights reserved. 1 https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/graphtransformer. <ref type="bibr">et al. 2017)</ref> in graph neural networks (GNNs), this process of learning word feature representations by combining feature information from other words in a sentence can alternatively be viewed as a case of a GNN applied on a fully connected graph of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Joshi 2020)</ref>. Transformers based models have led to state-of-the-art performance on several NLP applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Devlin et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Radford et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al. 2020</ref>). On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNNs) are shown to be the most effective neural network architectures on graph datasets and have achieved significant success on a wide range of applications, such as in knowledge graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schlichtkrull et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chami et al. 2020)</ref>, in social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Monti et al. 2019)</ref>, in physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cranmer et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020)</ref>, etc.</p><p>In particular, GNNs exploit the given arbitrary graph structure while learning the feature representations for nodes and edges and eventually the learned representations are used for downstream tasks. In this work, we explore inductive biases at the convergence of these two active research areas in deep learning towards presenting an improved version of Graph Transformer (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) which extends the key design components of the NLP transformers to arbitrary graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>As a preliminary, we highlight the most recent research works which attempt to develop graph transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nguyen, Nguyen, and Phung 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al. 2020)</ref> with few focused on specialized cases such as on heterogeneous graphs, temporal networks, generative modeling, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yun et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Xu, Joshi, and Bresson 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhou et al. 2020)</ref>. The model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al. (2019)</ref> employs attention to all graph nodes instead of a node's local neighbors for the purpose of capturing global information. This limits the efficient exploitation of sparsity which we show is a good inductive bias for learning on graph datasets. For the purpose of global information, we argue that there are other ways to incorporate the same instead of letting go sparsity and local contexts. For example, the use of graph-specific positional features <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al. 2020)</ref>, or node Laplacian position eigenvectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Belkin and Niyogi 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. 2020)</ref>, or relative learnable positional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(You, Ying, and Leskovec 2019)</ref>, virtual nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Li et al. 2015)</ref>, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al. (2020)</ref> propose Graph-BERT with an emphasis on pre- training and parallelized learning using a subgraph batching scheme that creates fixed-size linkless subgraphs to be passed to the model instead of the original graph. Graph-BERT employs a combination of several positional encoding schemes to capture absolute node structural and relative node positional information. Since the original graph is not used directly in Graph-BERT and the subgraphs do not have edges between the nodes (i.e., linkless), the proposed combination of positional encodings attempts at retaining the original graph structure information in the nodes. We perform detailed analysis of Graph-BERT positional encoding schemes, along with experimental comparison with the model we present in this paper in Section 4.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yun et al. (2019)</ref> developed Graph Transformer Networks (GTN) to learn on heterogeneous graphs with a target to transform a given heterogeneous graph into a meta-path based graph and then perform convolution. Notably, their focus behind the use of attention framework is for inter-preting the generated meta-paths. There is another transformer based approach developed for heterogeneous information networks, namely Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hu et al. (2020)</ref>. Apart from its ability of handling arbitrary number of node and edge types, HGT also captures the dynamics of information flow in the heterogeneous graphs in the form of relative temporal positional encoding which is based on the timestamp differences of the central node and the message-passing nodes. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhou et al. (2020)</ref> proposed a transformer based generative model which generates temporal graphs by directly learning from dynamic information in networks. The architecture presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nguyen, Nguyen, and Phung (2019)</ref> somewhat proceeds along our goal to develop graph transformer for arbitrary homogeneous graphs with a coordinate embedding based positional encoding scheme. However, their experiments show that the coordinate embeddings are not universal in performance and only helps in a couple of unsupervised learning experiments among all evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contributions</head><p>Overall, we find that the most fruitful ideas from the transformers literature in NLP can be applied in a more efficient way and posit that sparsity and positional encodings are two key aspects in the development of a Graph Transformer. As opposed to designing a best performing model for specific graph tasks, our work attempts for a generic, competitive transformer model which draws ideas together from the domains of NLP and GNNs. For an overview, this paper brings the following contributions:</p><p>• We put forward a generalization of transformer networks to homogeneous graphs of arbitrary structure, namely Graph Transformer, and an extended version of Graph Transformer with edge features that allows the usage of explicit domain information as edge features.</p><p>• Our method includes an elegant way to fuse node positional features using Laplacian eigenvectors for graph datasets, inspired from the heavy usage of positional encodings in NLP transformer models and recent research on node positional features in GNNs. The comparison with literature shows Laplacian eigenvectors to be wellplaced than any existing approaches to encode node positional information for arbitrary homogeneous graphs.</p><p>• Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses baseline isotropic and anisotropic GNNs. The architecture simultaneously emerges as a better attention based GNN baseline as well as a simple and effective Transformer network baseline for graph datasets for future research at the intersection of attention and graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Proposed Architecture</head><p>As stated earlier, we take into account two key aspects to develop Graph Transformers -sparsity and positional encodings which should ideally be used in the best possible way for learning on graph datasets. We first discuss the motivations behind these using a transition from NLP to graphs, and then introduce the architecture proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">On Graph Sparsity</head><p>In NLP transformers, a sentence is treated as a fully connected graph and this choice can be justified for two reasons -a) First, it is difficult to find meaningful sparse interactions or connections among the words in a sentence. For instance, the dependency of a word in a sentence on another word can vary with context, perspective of a user and specific application. There can be numerous plausible ground truth connections among words in a sentence and therefore, text datasets of sentences do not have explicit word interactions available. It thereby makes sense to have each word attending to each other word in a sentence, as followed by the Transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al. 2017</ref>). -b) Next, the so-called graph considered in an NLP transformer often has less than tens or hundreds of nodes (i.e. sentences are often less than tens or hundreds of words). This makes for computationally feasibility and large transformer models can be trained on such fully connected graphs of words. In case of actual graph datasets, graphs have arbitrary connectivity structure available depending on the domain and target of application, and have node sizes in ranges of up to millions, or billions. The available structure presents us with a rich source of information to exploit as an inductive bias in a neural network, whereas the node sizes practically makes it impossible to have a fully connected graph for such datasets. On these accounts, it is ideal and practical to have a Graph Transformer where a node attends to local node neighbors, same as in GNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Monti et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gilmer et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Veličković et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bresson and Laurent 2017;</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">On Positional Encodings</head><p>In NLP, transformer based models are, in most cases, supplied with a positional encoding for each word. This is critical to ensure unique representation for each word, and eventually preserve distance information. For graphs, the design of unique node positions is challenging as there are symmetries which prevent canonical node positional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Murphy et al. 2019)</ref>. In fact, most of the GNNs which are trained on graph datasets learn structural node information that are invariant to the node position <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Srinivasan and Ribeiro 2020)</ref>. This is a critical reason why simple attention based models, such as GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Veličković et al. 2018)</ref>, where the attention is a function of local neighborhood connectivity, instead full-graph connectivity, do not seem to achieve competitive performance on graph datasets. The issue of positional embeddings has been explored in recent GNN works <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Murphy et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">You, Ying, and Leskovec 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Srinivasan and Ribeiro 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al. 2020)</ref> with a goal to learn both structural and positional features. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. (2020)</ref> make the use of available graph structure to pre-compute Laplacian eigenvectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Belkin and Niyogi 2003)</ref> and use them as node positional information. Since Laplacian PEs are generalization of the PE used in the original transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref> to graphs and these better help encode distance-aware information (i.e., nearby nodes have similar positional features and farther nodes have dissimilar positional features), we use Laplacian eigenvectors as PE in Graph Transformer. Although these eigenvectors have multiplicity occuring due to the arbitrary sign of eigenvectors, we randomly flip the sign of the eigenvectors during training, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. (2020)</ref>.We pre-compute the Laplacian eigenvectors of all graphs in the dataset. Eigenvectors are defined via the factorization of the graph Laplacian matrix;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆ = I − D −1/2 AD −1/2 = U T ΛU,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A is the n × n adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and Λ, U correspond to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively. We use the k smallest non-trivial eigenvectors of a node as its positional encoding and denote by λ i for node i. Finally, we refer to Section 4.1 for a comparison of Laplacian PE with existing Graph-BERT PEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Graph Transformer Architecture</head><p>We now introduce the Graph Transformer Layer and Graph Transformer Layer with edge features. The layer architecture is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The first model is designed for graphs which do not have explicit edge attributes, whereas the second model maintains a designated edge feature pipeline to incorporate the available edge information and maintain their abstract representations at every layer.</p><p>Input First of all, we prepare the input node and edge embeddings to be passed to the Graph Transformer Layer. For a graph G with node features α i ∈ R dn×1 for each node i and edge features β ij ∈ R de×1 for each edge between node i and node j, the input node features α i and edge features β ij are passed via a linear projection to embed these to ddimensional hidden features h 0 i and e 0 ij .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h 0 i = A 0 α i + a 0 ; e 0 ij = B 0 β ij + b 0 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where A 0 ∈ R d×dn , B 0 ∈ R d×de and a 0 , b 0 ∈ R d are the parameters of the linear projection layers. We now embed the pre-computed node positional encodings of dim k via a linear projection and add to the node featuresĥ 0 i . Graph Transformer Layer The Graph Transformer is closely the same transformer architecture initially proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al. 2017</ref>), see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (Left). We now proceed to define the node update equations for a layer .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">λ 0 i = C 0 λ i + c 0 ; h 0 i =ĥ 0 i + λ 0 i ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">h +1 i = O h H k=1 j∈Ni w k, ij V k, h j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where, w k,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ij = softmax j Q k, h i · K k, h j √ d k ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and Q k, , K k, , V k, ∈ R d k ×d , O h ∈ R d×d , k = 1 to H denotes the number of attention heads, and denotes concatenation. For numerical stability, the outputs after taking exponents of the terms inside softmax is clamped to a value between −5 to +5. The attention outputsĥ +1 i are then passed to a Feed Forward Network (FFN) preceded and succeeded by residual connections and normalization layers, as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h +1 i = Norm h i +ĥ +1 i ,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">h +1 i = W 2 ReLU(W 1ĥ +1 i ),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">h +1 i = Norm ĥ +1 i +ĥ +1 i ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W 1 , ∈ R 2d×d , W 2 , ∈ R d×2d ,ĥ +1 i ,ĥ +1</formula><p>i denote intermediate representations, and Norm can either be Layer-Norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ba, Kiros, and Hinton 2016)</ref> or BatchNorm <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ioffe and Szegedy 2015)</ref>. The bias terms are omitted for clarity of presentation.</p><p>Graph Transformer Layer with edge features The Graph Transformer with edge features is designed for better utilization of rich feature information available in several graph datasets in the form of edge attributes. See <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (Right) for a reference to the building block of a layer. Since our objective remains to better use the edge features which are pairwise scores corresponding to a node pair, we tie these available edge features to implicit edge scores computed by pairwise attention. In other words, say an intermediate attention score before softmax,ŵ ij , is computed when a node i attends to node j after the multiplication of query and key feature projections, see the expression inside the brackets in Equation 5. Let us treat this scoreŵ ij as implicit information about the edge &lt; i, j &gt;. We now try to inject the available edge information for the edge &lt; i, j &gt; and improve the already computed implicit attention scoreŵ ij . It is done by simply multiplying the two valuesŵ ij and e ij , see Equation 12. This kind of information injection is not seen to be explored much, or applied in NLP Transformers as there is usually no available feature information between two words. However, in graph datasets such as molecular graphs, or social media graphs, there is often some feature information available on the edge interactions and it becomes natural to design an architecture to use this information while learning. For the edges, we also maintain a designated nodesymmetric edge feature representation pipeline for propagating edge attributes from one layer to another, see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We now proceed to define the layer update equations for a layer .ĥ</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">+1 i = O h H k=1 j∈Ni w k, ij V k, h j ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">e +1 ij = O e H k=1 ŵ k, ij , where,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">w k, ij = softmax j (ŵ k, ij ),<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">w k, ij = Q k, h i · K k, h j √ d k · E k, e ij ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Q k, , K k, , V k, , E k, ∈ R d k ×d , O h , O e ∈ R d×d , k = 1</formula><p>to H denotes the number of attention head, and denotes concatenation. For numerical stability, the outputs after taking exponents of the terms inside softmax is clamped to a value between −5 to +5. The outputsĥ +1 i andê +1 ij are then passed to separate Feed Forward Networks preceded and succeeded by residual connections and normalization layers, as:ĥ</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">+1 i = Norm h i +ĥ +1 i ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">h +1 i = W h,2 ReLU(W h,1ĥ +1 i ),<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">h +1 i = Norm ĥ +1 i +ĥ +1 i ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">W h,1 , ∈ R 2d×d , W h,2 , ∈ R d×2d ,ĥ +1 i ,ĥ +1 i denote intermediate representations, e +1 ij = Norm e ij +ê +1 ij , (16) e +1 ij = W e,2 ReLU(W e,1ê +1 ij ),<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">e +1 ij = Norm ê +1 ij +ê +1 ij ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">W e,1 , ∈ R 2d×d , W e,2 , ∈ R d×2d ,ê +1 ij ,ê +1 ij denote intermediate representations.</formula><p>Task based MLP Layers The node representations obtained at the final layer of Graph Transformer are passed to a task based MLP network for computing task-dependent outputs, which are then fed to a loss function to train the parameters of the model. The formal definitions of the task based layers that we use can be found in Appendix A.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Numerical Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the performance of proposed Graph Transformer on three benchmark graph datasets-ZINC <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Irwin et al. 2012)</ref>, PATTERN and CLUSTER (Abbe 2017) from a recent GNN benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dwivedi et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>ZINC, Graph Regression ZINC <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Irwin et al. 2012</ref>) is a molecular dataset with the task of graph property regression for constrained solubility.

Since this dataset have rich feature information in terms of bonds as edge attributes, we use the 'Graph Transformer with edge features' for this task. We use the 12K subset of the data as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. (2020)</ref>.</p></div>

The task is classify the nodes into 2 communities. PATTERN graphs do not have explicit edge features and hence we use the simple 'Graph Transformer' for this task. The size of this dataset is 14K graphs.</p><p>CLUSTER, Node Classification CLUSTER is also a synthetically generated dataset using SBM model. The task is to assign a cluster label to each node. There are total 6 cluster labels. Similar to PATTERN, CLUSTER graphs do not have explicit edge features and hence we use the simple 'Graph Transformer' for this task. The size of this dataset is 12K graphs. We refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dwivedi et al. 2020)</ref> for additional information, inlcuding preparation, of these datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Configurations</head><p>For experiments, we follow the benchmarking protocol introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dwivedi et al. (2020)</ref> based on PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Paszke et al. 2019)</ref> and DGL <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2019)</ref>. We use 10 layers of Graph Transformer layers with each layer having 8 attention heads and arbitrary hidden dimensions such that the total number of trainable parameters is in the range of 500k. We use learning rate decay strategy to train the models where the training stops at a point when the learning rate reaches to a value of 1 × 10 −6 .

For all three benchmark datasets, the experiments score the highest performance in this setting, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. • The proposed architecture performs significantly better than baseline isotropic and anisotropic GNNs (GCN and GAT respectively), and helps close the gap between the original transformer and transformer for graphs. Notably, our architecture emerges as a fresh and improved attention based GNN baseline surpassing GAT (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>), which employs multi-headed attention inspired by the original transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref> and have been often used in the literature as a baseline for attention-based GNN models. • As expected, sparse graph connectivity is a critical inductive bias for datasets with arbitrary graph structure, as demonstrated by comparing sparse vs. full graph experiments. • Our proposed extension of Graph Transformer with edge features reaches close to the best performing GNN, i.e., GatedGCN, on ZINC. This architecture specifically brings exciting promise to datasets where domain information along pairwise interactions can be leveraged for maximum learning performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Comparison to PEs used in Graph-BERT</head><p>In addition to the reasons underscored in Sections 1.1 and 2.2, we demonstrate the usefulness of Laplacian eigenvectors as a suitable candidate PE for Graph Transformer in this section, by its comparison with different PE schemes applied in Graph-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al. 2020</ref>). 2 In Graph-BERT, which operates on fixed size sampled subgraphs, a node attends to every other node in a subgraph. For a given graph G = (V, E) with V nodes and E edges, a subgraph g i of size k + 1 is created for every node i in the graph, which means the original single graph G is converted to V subgraphs. For a subgraph g i corresponding to node u i , the k other nodes are the ones which have the top k intimacy scores with node u i based on a pre-computed intimacy matrix that maps every edge in the graph G to an intimacy score. While the sampling is great for parallelization and efficiency, the original graph structure is not directly used in the layers. Graph-BERT uses  a combination of node PE schemes to inform the model on node structural, positional, and distance information from original graph-i) Intimacy based relative PE, ii) Hop based relative distance encoding, and iii) Weisfeiler Lehman based absolute PE (WL-PE). The intimacy based PE and the hop based PE are variant to the sampled subgraphs, i.e., these PEs for a node in a subgraph g i depends on the node u i w.r.t which it is sampled, and cannot be directly used in other cases unless we use similar sampling strategy. The WL-PE which are absolute structural roles of nodes in the original graph computed using WL algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Niepert, Ahmed, and Kutzkov 2016)</ref>, are not variant to the subgraphs and can be easily used as a generic PE mechanism. On that account, we swap Laplacian PE in our experiments for an ablation analysis and use WL-PE from Graph-BERT, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. As Laplacian PE capture better structural and positional information about the nodes, which essentially is the objective behind using the three Graph-BERT PEs, they outperform the WL-PE. Besides, WL-PEs tend to overfit SBM datasets and lead to poor generalization.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This work presented a simple yet effective approach to generalize transformer networks on arbitrary graphs and introduced the corresponding architecture. Our experiments consistently showed that the presence of -i) Laplacian eigenvectors as node positional encodings and -ii) batch normalization, in place of layer normalization, around the transformer feed forward layers enhanced the transformer universally on all experiments. Given the simple and generic nature of our architecture and competitive performance against standard GNNs, we believe the proposed model can be used as baseline for further improvement across graph applications employing node attention. In future works, we are interested in building upon the graph transformer along aspects such as efficient training on single large graphs, applicability on heterogeneous domains, etc., and perform efficient graph representation learning keeping in account the recent innovations in graph inductive biases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>where C 0 ∈ R d×k and c 0 ∈ R d .
