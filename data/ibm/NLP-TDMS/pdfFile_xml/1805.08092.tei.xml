				<p>Neural models for question answering (QA) over documents have achieved significant performance improvements. Although effective, these models do not scale to large corpora due to their complex mod-eling of interactions between the document and the question. Moreover, recent work has shown that such models are sensitive to adversarial inputs. In this paper, we study the minimal context required to answer the question, and find that most questions in existing datasets can be answered with a small set of sentences. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to feed into the QA model. Our overall system achieves significant reductions in training (up to 15 times) and inference times (up to 13 times), with accuracy comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on SQuAD, NewsQA, TriviaQA and SQuAD-Open.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The task of textual question answering (QA), in which a machine reads a document and answers a question, is an important and challenging problem in natural language processing. Recent progress in performance of QA models has been largely due to the variety of available QA datasets ( <ref type="bibr">Richard- son et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajpurkar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trischler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kočisk`Kočisk`y et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>Many neural QA models have been proposed for these datasets, the most successful of which tend to leverage coattention or bidirectional attention mechanisms that build codependent representations of the document and the question ( <ref type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seo et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>Yet, learning the full context over the document is challenging and inefficient. In particular, when the model is given a long document, or multiple documents, learning the full context is intractably slow and hence difficult to scale to large corpora. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Jia and Liang (2017)</ref> show that, given adversarial inputs, such models tend to focus on wrong parts of the context and produce incorrect answers.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to develop a QA system that is scalable to large documents as well as robust to adversarial inputs. First, we study the context required to answer the question by sampling examples in the dataset and carefully analyzing them. We find that most questions can be answered using a few sentences, without the consideration of context over entire document. In particular, we observe that on the SQuAD dataset <ref type="bibr">(Ra- jpurkar et al., 2016</ref>), 92% of answerable questions can be answered using a single sentence.</p><p>Second, inspired by this observation, we propose a sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to give to the QA model in order to answer the question. Since the minimum number of sentences depends on the question, our sentence selector chooses a different number of sentences for each question, in contrast with previous models that select a fixed number of sentences. Our sentence selector leverages three simple techniques -weight transfer, data modification and score normalization, which we show to be highly effective on the task of sentence selection.</p><p>We compare the standard QA model given the full document (FULL) and the QA model given the arXiv: <ref type="bibr">1805</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Question  sent SQuAD TriviaQA  1  90  56</ref> In 1873, Tesla returned to his birthtown, Smiljan.

On three of those datasets, this improvements leads to the new stateof-the-art. In addition, our experimental results and analyses show that our approach is more robust to adversarial inputs. On the development set of SQuAD-Adversarial (Jia and Liang, 2017), MINIMAL outperforms the previous state-of-theart model by up to 13%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task analyses</head><p>Existing QA models focus on learning the context over different parts in the full document. Although effective, learning the context within the full document is challenging and inefficient. Consequently, we study the minimal context in the document required to answer the question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Human studies</head><p>First, we randomly sample 50 examples from the SQuAD development set, and analyze the minimum number of sentences required to answer the question, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. We observed that 98% of questions are answerable given the document. The remaining 2% of questions are not answerable even given the entire document. For instance, in the last example in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the question requires the background knowledge that Charles Dickens is an English Victorian author. Among the answerable examples, 92% are answerable with a single sentence, 6% with two sentences, and 2% with three or more sentences.</p><p>We perform a similar analysis on the TriviaQA (Wikipedia) development (verified) set. Finding the sentences to answer the question on TriviaQA is more challenging than on SQuAD, since TriviaQA documents are much longer than SQuAD documents (488 vs 5 sentences per document). Nevertheless, we find that most examples are answerable with one or two sentences -among the 88% of examples that are answerable given the full document, 95% can be answered with one or two sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analyses on existing QA model</head><p>Given that the majority of examples are <ref type="table">answer- able with a single oracle sentence on SQuAD, we</ref> analyze the performance of an existing, competitive QA model when it is given the oracle sentence. We train DCN+ ( <ref type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2018)</ref>, one of the state-of-the-art models on SQuAD (details in Section 3.1), on the oracle sentence. The model achieves 83.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the full document and 85.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the oracle sentence. We analyze 50 randomly sampled examples in which the model fails on exact match (EM) despite using the oracle sentence. We classify these errors into 4 categories, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. In these examples, we observed that 40% of questions are answerable given the oracle sentence but the model unexpectedly fails to find the answer. 58% are those in which the model's prediction is correct but does not lexically match the groundtruth answer, as shown in the first example in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. 2% are those in which the question is not answerable even given the full document. In addition, we compare predictions by the model trained using the full document (FULL) with the model trained on the oracle sentence (ORACLE). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the Venn diagram of the questions answered correctly by FULL and ORACLE on SQuAD and NewsQA. ORACLE is able to answer 93% and 86% of the questions correctly answered by FULL on SQuAD and NewsQA, respectively.</p><p>These experiments and analyses indicate that if the model can accurately predict the oracle sentence, the model should be able to achieve comparable performance on overall QA task. Therefore, we aim to create an effective, efficient and robust QA system which only requires a single or a few sentences to answer the question.</p></div>

More details including hyperparameters and training procedures are shown in Appendix A.</p><p>Because the minimal set of sentences required to answer the question depends on the question, we select the set of sentences by thresholding the sentence scores, where the threshold is a hyperparameter (details in Appendix A). This method allows the model to select a variable number of sentences for each question, as opposed to a fixed number of sentences for all questions. Also, by controlling the threshold, the number of sentences can be dynamically controlled during the inference. We define Dyn (for Dynamic) as this method, and define Top k as the method which simply selects the top-k sentences for each question.</p></div>

The speed is measured using a single GPU (Tesla K80), and includes the training and inference time for the sentence selector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SQuAD and NewsQA</head><p>For each QA model, we experiment with three types of inputs. First, we use the full document (FULL). Next, we give the model the oracle sentence containing the groundtruth answer span (ORACLE). Finally, we select sentences using our sentence selector (MINIMAL), using both Top k and Dyn. We also compare this last method with TF-IDF method for sentence selection, which selects sentences using n-gram TF-IDF distance between each sentence and the question.    Results <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows results in the task of sentence selection on SQuAD and NewsQA.

In the last example, our sentence selector fails to choose the oracle sentence, so the QA model cannot predict the correct answer. In this case, our selector chooses the second and the third sentences instead of the oracle sentence because the former contains more information relevant to question. In fact, the context over the first and the second sentences is required to correctly answer the question. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows an example on SQuAD, which MINIMAL with Dyn correctly answers the question, and MINIMAL with Top k sometimes does not. Top 1 selects one sentence in the first example, thus fails to choose the oracle sentence.

In both examples, Dyn selects the oracle sentence with minimum number of sentences, and subsequently predicts the answer. More analyses are shown in Appendix B.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed an efficient and robust QA system that is scalable to large documents and robust to adversarial inputs. First, we studied the minimal context required to answer the question in existing datasets and found that most questions can be answered using a small set of sentences. Second, inspired by this observation, we proposed a sentence selector which selects a minimal set of sentences to answer the question to give to the QA model. We demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method across five different datasets with varying sizes of source documents. We achieved the training and inference speedup of up to 15× and 13×, respectively, and accuracy comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art. In addition, we showed that our approach is more robust to adversarial inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Models Details</head><p>S-Reader The model architecture of S-Reader is divided into the encoder module and the decoder module. The encoder module is identical to that of our sentence selector. It first takes the document and the question as inputs</p><note type="other">, obtains document embeddings D ∈ R L d ×h d , question embeddings Q ∈ R Lq×h d and question-aware document embeddings D q ∈ R L d ×h d , where D q is defined as Equation 1, and finally obtains document encodings D enc and question encodings Q enc as Equation 3. The decoder module obtains the scores for start and end position of the answer span by calculating bilinear similarities between document encodings and question encodings as follows.</note><formula xml:id="formula_6">β = softmax(w T 1 Q enc ) ∈ R Lq (10) ˜ q enc = Lq j=1 (β j Q enc j ) ∈ R h<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">score start = D enc W start˜qstart˜ start˜q enc ∈ R L d (12) score end = D enc W end˜qend˜ end˜q enc ∈ RL d (13)</formula><p>Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">w 1 ∈ R h , W start , W end ∈ R h×h are trainable weight matrices.</formula><p>The overall architecture is similar to Document Reader in DrQA ( <ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017)</ref>, except they are different in obtaining embeddings and use different hyperparameters. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, our S-Reader obtains F1 score of 79.9 on SQuAD development data, while Document Reader in DrQA achieves 78.8.</p><p>Training details We implement all of our models using PyTorch. First, the corpus is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP toolkit <ref type="bibr">(Man- ning et al., 2014</ref>). We obtain the embeddings of the document and the question by concatenating 300-dimensional Glove embeddings pretrained on the 840B Common Crawl corpus <ref type="bibr">(Pen- nington et al., 2014</ref>), 100-dimensional character ngram embeddings by <ref type="bibr">Hashimoto et al. (2017)</ref>, and 300-dimensional contextualized embeddings pretrained on WMT ( <ref type="bibr">McCann et al., 2017</ref>). We do not use handcraft word features such as POS and NER tagging, which is different from Document Reader in DrQA. Hence, the dimension of the embedding (d h ) is 600. We use the hidden size (h) of 200. We apply dropout with 0.2 drop rate ( <ref type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>) to encodings and LSTMs for regularization. We train the models using ADAM optimizer ( <ref type="bibr">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) with default hyperparameters. When we train and evaluate the model on the dataset, the document is truncated to the maximum length of min <ref type="bibr">(2000, max(1000, L th )</ref>) words, where L th is the length which covers 90% of documents in the whole examples.</p><p>Selection details Here, we describe how to dynamically select sentences using Dyn method. Given the sentences S all = {s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , ..., s n }, ordered by scores from the sentence selector in descending order, the selected sentences S selected is as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S candidate = {s i ∈ S all |score(s i ) &gt;= 1 − th} (14) S selected = S candidate if S candidate = ∅ {s 1 } o.w.<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Here, score(s i ) is the score of sentence s i from the sentence selector, and th is a hyperparameter between 0 and 1.</p><p>The number of sentences to select can be dynamically controlled during inference by adjusting th, so that proper number of sentences can be selected depending on the needs of accuracy and speed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows the trade-off between the number of sentences and accuracy, as well as the number of selected sentences depending on the threshold th.</p></div>

we use 40 paragraphs and 5-20 sentences, respectively. 'n sent' indicates the number of sentences used 
during inference. 'Acc' indicates accuracy of whether answer text is contained in selected context. 'Sp' 
indicates inference speed. We compare with the results from the sentences selected by TF-IDF method 
and our selector (Dyn). We also compare with published Rank1-3 models. For TriviaQA(Wikipedia), 
they are Neural Casecades (Swayamdipta et al., 2018), Reading Twice for Natural Language Under-
standing (Weissenborn, 2017) and Mnemonic Reader (Hu et al., 2017). For SQuAD-Open, they are 
DrQA (Chen et al., 2017) (Multitask), R 3 (Wang et al., 2018) and DrQA (Plain).
