<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, we carefully implement the BOWIMG baseline model. We call it iBOWIMG to avoid confusion with the implementation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. With proper setup and training, this simple baseline model shows comparable performance to many recent recurrent network-based approaches for visual QA. Further analysis shows that the baseline learns to correlate the informative words in the question sentence and visual concepts in the image with the answer. Furthermore, such correlations can be used to compute reasonable spatial attention map with the help of the CAM technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. The source code and the visual QA demo based on the trained model are publicly available. In the demo, iBOWIMG baseline gives answers to any question relevant to the given images. Playing with the visual QA models interactively could reveal the strengths and weakness of the trained model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">iBOWIMG for Visual Question Answering</head><p>In most of the recent proposed models, visual QA is simplified to a classification task: the number of the different answers in the training set is the number of the final classes the models need to learn to predict. The general pipeline of those models is that the word feature extracted from the question sentence is concatenated with the visual feature extracted from the image, then they are fed into a softmax layer to predict the answer class. The visual feature is usually taken from the top of the VGG network or GoogLeNet, while the word features of the question sentence are usually the popular LSTM-based features <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In our iBOWIMG model, we simply use naive bag-of-words as the text feature, and use the deep features from GoogLeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> as the visual features. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the framework of the iBOWIMG model, which can be implemented in Torch with no more than 10 lines of code. The input question is first converted to a one-hot vector, which is transformed to word feature via a word embedding layer and then is concatenated with the image feature from CNN. The combined feature is sent to the softmax layer to predict the answer class, which essentially is a multi-class logistic regression model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Here we train and evaluate the iBOWIMG model on the Full release of COCO VQA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the largest VQA dataset so far. In the COCO VQA dataset, there are 3 questions annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers for each image in the COCO dataset. For each question, 10 answers are annotated by another batch of AMT workers. To pre-process the annotation for training, we perform majority voting on the 10 ground-truth answers to get the most certain answer To generate the training set and validation set for our model, we first randomly split the images of COCO val2014 into 70% subset A and 30% subset B. To avoid potential overfitting, questions sharing the same image will be placed into the same split.</p><p>The question-answer pairs from the images of COCO train2014 + val2014 subset A are combined and used for training, while the val2014 subset B is used as validation set for parameter tuning. After we find the best model parameters, we combine the whole train2014 and val2014 to train the final model. We submit the prediction result given by the final model on the testing set (COCO test2015) to the evaluation server, to get the final accuracy on the test-dev and test-standard set. For Open-Ended Question track, we take the top-1 predicted answer from the softmax output. For the Multiple-Choice Question track, we first get the softmax probability for each of the given choices then select the most confident one.</p><p>The code is implemented in Torch. The training takes about 10 hours on a single GPU NVIDIA Titan Black.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Benchmark Performance</head><p>According to the evaluation standard of the VQA dataset, the result of the any proposed VQA models should report accuracy on the test-standard set for fair comparison. We report our baseline on the test-dev set in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and the test-standard set in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The test-dev set is used for debugging and validation experiments and allows for unlimited submission to the evaluation server, while teststandard is used for model comparison with limited submission times.</p><p>Since this VQA dataset is rather new, the publicly available models evaluated on the dataset are all from non-peer reviewed arXiv papers. We include the performance of the models available at the time of writing (Dec.5, 2015) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. Note that some models are evaluated on either test-dev or test-standard for either Open-Ended or Multiple-Choice track.</p><p>The full set of the VQA dataset was released on Oct.6 2015; previously the v0.1 version and v0.9 version had been released. We notice that some models are evaluated using non-standard setups, rendering performance comparisons difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> (arXiv dated at Nov.17 2015) used v0.9 version of VQA with their own split of training and testing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> (arXiv dated at Nov.7 2015) used their own split of training and testing for the val2014; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (arXiv dated at Nov.18 2015) used v0.9 version of VQA dataset. So these are not included in the comparison.</p><p>Except for these IMG, BOW, BOWIMG baselines provided in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, all the compared methods use either deep or recursive neural networks. However, our iBOWIMG baseline shows comparable performances against these much more complex models, except for DPPnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> that is about 1.5% better. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Training Details</head><p>Learning rate and weight clip. We find that setting up a different learning rate and weight clipping for the word embedding layer and softmax layer leads to better performance. The learning rate for the word embedding layer should be much higher than the learning rate of softmax layer to learn a good word embedding. From the performance of BOW in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we can see that a good word model is crucial to the accuracy, as BOW model alone could achieve closely to 48%, even without looking at the image content.</p><p>Model parameters to tune. Though our model could be considered as the simplest baseline so far for visual QA, there are several model parameters to tune: 1) the number of epochs to train. 2) the learning rate and weight clip. 3) the threshold for removing less frequent question word and answer classes. We iterate to search the best value of each model parameter separately on the val2014 subset B. In our best model, there are 5,746 words in the dictionary of question sentence, 5,216 classes of answers. The specific model parameters can be found in the source code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Understanding the Visual QA model</head><p>From the comparisons above, we can see that our baseline model performs as well as the recurrent neural network models on the VQA dataset. Furthermore, due to its simplicity, the behavior of the model could be easily interpreted, demonstrating what it learned for visual QA.</p><p>Essentially, the BOWIMG baseline model learns to memorize the correlation between the answer class and the informative words in the question sentence along with the visual feature. We split the learned weights of softmax into two parts, one part for the word feature and the other part for the visual feature. Therefore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r = M w x w + M v x v .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here the softmax matrix M is decomposed into the weights M w for word feature x w and the weights M v for the visual feature</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x v whereas M = [M w , M v ].</formula><p>r is the response of the answer class before softmax normalization. Denote the response r w = M w x w as the contribution from question words and r v = M v x v as the contribution from the image contents. Thus for each predicted answer, we know exactly the proportions of contribution from word and image content respectively. We also could rank r w and r v to know what the predicted answer could be if the model only relies on one side of information. To further understand the answers predicted by the model given the visual feature and question sentence, we first decompose the word contribution of the answer into single words of the question sentence, then we visualize the informative image regions relevant to the answer through the technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.    Since there are just two linear transformations (one is word embedding and the other is softmax matrix multiplication) from the one hot vector to the answer response, we could easily know the importance of each single word in the question to the predicted answer. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, we plot the ranked word importance for each word in the question sentence. In the first image question word 'doing' is informative to the answer 'texting' while in the second image question word 'eating' is informative to the answer 'hot dog'.</p><p>To highlight the informative image regions relevant to the predicted answer we apply a technique called Class Activation Mapping (CAM) proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The CAM technique leverages the linear relation between the softmax prediction and the final convolutional feature map, which allows us to identify the most discriminative image regions relevant to the predicted result. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> we plot the heatmaps generated by the CAM associated with the predicted answer, which highlight the informative image regions such as the cellphone in the first image to the answer 'texting' and the hot dog in the first image to the answer 'hot dog'. The example in lower part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the heatmaps generated by two different questions and answers. Visual features from CNN already have implicit attention and selectivity over the image region, thus the resulting class activation maps are similar to the maps generated by the attention mechanisms of the VQA models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interactive Visual QA Demo</head><p>Question answering is essentially an interactive activity, thus it would be good to make the trained models able to interact with people in real time. Aided by the simplicity of the baseline model, we built a web demo that people could type question about a given image and our AI system powered by iBOWIMG will reply the most possible answers. Here the deep feature of the images are extracted beforehand. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows a snapshot of the demo. People could play with the demo to see the strength and weakness of VQA model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding Remarks</head><p>For visual question answering on COCO dataset, our implementation of a simple baseline achieves comparable performance to several recently proposed recurrent neural network-based approaches.</p><p>To reach the correct prediction, the baseline captures the correlation between the informative words in the question and the answer, and that between image contents and the answer. How to move beyond this, from memorizing the correlations to actual reasoning and understanding of the question and image, is a goal for future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Framework of the iBOWIMG. Features from the question sentence and image are concatenated then feed into softmax to predict the answer.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>shows some examples of the predictions, revealing that the question words usually have dominant influence on predicting the answer. For example, the correctly predicted answers for the two questions given for the first image 'what is the color of sofa' and 'which brand is the laptop' come mostly from the question words, without the need for image. This demonstrates the bias in the frequency of object and actions appearing in the images of COCO dataset. For the second image, we ask 'what are they doing': the words-only prediction gives 'playing wii (10.62), eating (9.97), playing frisbee (9.24)', while full prediction gives the correct prediction 'playing baseball (10.67 = 2.01 [image] + 8.66 [word])'.</figDesc></figure>
