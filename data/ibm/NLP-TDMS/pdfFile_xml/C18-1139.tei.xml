				<p>Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CONLL03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A large family of NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging may be formulated as sequence labeling problems; text is treated as a sequence of words to be labeled with linguistic tags. Current state-of-the-art approaches for sequence labeling typically use the LSTM variant of bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BiLSTMs), and a subsequent conditional random field (CRF) decoding layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ma and Hovy, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A crucial component in such approaches are word embeddings, typically trained over very large collections of unlabeled data to assist learning and generalization. Current state-of-the-art methods concatenate up to three distinct embedding types:</p></div>

A sentence is input as a character sequence into a pre-trained bidirectional character language model. From this LM, we retrieve for each word a contextual embedding that we pass into a vanilla BiLSTM-CRF sequence labeler, achieving robust state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks (NER in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>.</p><p>Contextual string embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel type of contextualized characterlevel word embedding which we hypothesize to combine the best attributes of the above-mentioned embeddings; namely, the ability to (1) pre-train on large unlabeled corpora, (2) capture word meaning in context and therefore produce different embeddings for polysemous words depending on their usage, and (3) model words and context fundamentally as sequences of characters, to both better handle rare and misspelled words as well as model subword structures such as prefixes and endings. We present a method to generate such a contextualized embedding for any string of characters in a sentential context, and thus refer to the proposed representations as contextual string embeddings. Neural character-level language modeling. We base our proposed embeddings on recent advances in neural language modeling (LM) that have allowed language to be modeled as distributions over sequences of characters instead of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sutskever et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kim et al., 2015)</ref>. Recent work has shown that by learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models learn internal representations that capture syntactic and semantic properties: even though trained without an explicit notion of word and sentence boundaries, they have been shown to generate grammatically correct text, including words, subclauses, quotes and sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Karpathy et al., 2015</ref>). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Radford et al. (2017)</ref> showed that individual neurons in a large LSTM-LM can be attributed to specific semantic functions, such as predicting sentiment, without explicitly trained on a sentiment label set.</p><p>We show that an appropriate selection of hidden states from such a language model can be utilized to generate word-level embeddings that are highly effective in downstream sequence labeling tasks. State-of-the-art sequence labeling. Based on this, we propose the sequence tagging architecture illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: each sentence is passed as a sequence of characters to a bidirectional character-level neural language model, from which we retrieve for each word the internal character states to create a contextual string embedding. This embedding is then utilized in the BiLSTM-CRF sequence tagging module to address a downstream NLP task (NER in the <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>.</p><p>We experimentally verify our approach in the classic sequence labeling tasks of named entity recognition for English and German, phrase chunking and part-of-speech tagging, and find that our approach reliably achieves state-of-the-art results. In particular, for both German and English NER, our approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art. But even for highly saturated tasks such as PoS tagging and chunking we find slight improvements over the already strong state-of-the-art (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We also find that our proposed embeddings on some tasks subsume previous embedding types, enabling simplified sequence labeling architectures. In addition to this, the character-level LM is compact and relatively efficient to train in comparison to word-level models. This allows us to easily train models for new languages or domains.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Recurrent Network States</head><p>Like recent work, we use the LSTM variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zaremba et al., 2014</ref>) of recurrent neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sutskever et al., 2011</ref>) as language modeling architecture. These have been shown to far outperform earlier n-gram based models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jozefowicz et al., 2016</ref>) due to the ability of LSTMs to flexibly encode long-term dependencies with their hidden state. We use characters as atomic units of language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Graves, 2013)</ref>, allowing text to be treated as a sequence of characters passed to an LSTM which at each point in the sequence is trained to predict the next character <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . This means that the model possesses a hidden state for each character in the sequence.</p><p>Formally, the goal of a character-level language model is to estimate a good distribution P (x 0:T ) over sequences of charaters (x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x T ) =: x 0:T reflecting natural language production <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rosenfeld, 2000)</ref>. By training a language model, we learn P (x t |x 0 , . . . , x t−1 ), an estimate of the predictive distribution over the next character given past characters. The joint distribution over entire sentences can then be decomposed as a product of the predictive distribution over characters conditioned on the preceeding characters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (x 0:T ) = T t=0 P (x t |x 0:t−1 )<label>(1)</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extracting Word Representations</head><p>We utilize the hidden states of a forward-backward recurrent neural network to create contextualized word embeddings. This means, alongside with the forward model (2), we also have a backward model, which works in the same way but in the reversed direction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P b (x t |x t+1:T ) ≈ T t=0 P b x t |h b t , θ<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">h b t = f b h x t+1 , h b t+1 , c b t+1 ; θ (6) c b t = f b c x t+1 , h b t+1 , c b t+1 ; θ<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Note that, in the following, we will use the superscript · f to define h f t := h t , c f t := c t for the forward model described in the previous section.</p><p>From this forward-backward LM, we concatenate the following hidden character states for each word: from the fLM, we extract the output hidden state after the last character in the word. Since the fLM is trained to predict likely continuations of the sentence after this character, the hidden state encodes semantic-syntactic information of the sentence up to this point, including the word itself. Similarly, we extract the output hidden state before the word's first character from the bLM to capture semanticsyntactic information from the end of the sentence to this character. Both output hidden states are concatenated to form the final embedding and capture the semantic-syntactic information of the word itself as well as its surrounding context.</p><p>Formally, let the individual word-strings begin at character inputs with indices t 0 , t 1 , . . . , t n , then we define contextual string embeddings of these words as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">w CharLM i := h f t i+1 −1 h b t i −1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>We illustrate our approach in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for a word in an example sentence, with the fLM in red and the bLM shown in blue. Our approach thus produces embeddings from hidden states that are computed not only on the characters of a word, but also the characters of the surrounding context, since it influences the LM's ability to predict likely continuations of a sentence. As we later illustrate in Section 3.4, our proposed approach thus produces different embeddings for the same lexical word string in different contexts, and is able to accurately capture the semantics of contextual use together with word semantics itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sequence Labeling Architecture</head><p>In the default configuration of our approach, the final word embeddings are passed into a BiLSTM-CRF sequence labeling module as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huang et al. (2015)</ref> to address downstream sequence labeling tasks. Then let us call the inputs to the BiLSTM g l : w 0 , . . . , w n . Then we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r i : = r f i r b i<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Where r f i and r f i are the forward and backward output states of the BiLSTM g l . The final sequence probability is then given by a CRF over the possible sequence labels y:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (y 0:n |r 0:n ) ∝ n i=1 ψ i (y i−1 , y i , r i )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ψ i (y , y, r) = exp(W y ,y r + b y ,y )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Alternatively, we also experiment with directly applying a simple feedforward linear architecture (essentially multinomial logistic regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Menard, 2018)</ref>). This configuration simply linearly projects the hidden states of the neural character LM to make predictions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r i = W r w i + b r<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Then the prediction of the label is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (y i = j|r i ) = softmax(r i )[j]<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Stacking Embeddings. Current sequence labeling models often combine different types of embeddings by concatenating each embedding vector to form the final word vectors. We similarly experiment with different stackings of embeddings; for instance in many configurations it may be benficial to add classic word embeddings to add potentially greater latent word-level semantics to our proposed embeddings. In this case, the final words representation is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">w i = w CharLM i w GloV e i<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Here w GloV e i is a precomputed GLOVE embedding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). We present different configurations of stacked embeddings in the next section for the purpose of evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We conduct an experimental evaluation to assess in how far our proposed contextual string embeddings are useful for sequence labeling, and how they compare to existing embedding types. In addition, we aim to gain insights into the inherent semantics of the proposed embeddings. Tasks. To this end, we evaluate our embeddings in four classic sequence labeling tasks in their default evaluation setups, namely named entity recognition in the CONLL03 setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)</ref>, chunking in the CONLL2000 setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000</ref>) and PoS tagging in the default Penn treebank setup described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Collins (2002)</ref>. We evaluate NER to determine in how far our embeddings are helpful for shallow semantic tasks, while we use chunking and PoS to determine in how far they are helpful for shallow syntactic tasks. We also include the German NER task from the CONLL03 setup to evaluate our embeddings in a language with richer morphology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>We utilize the BiLSTM-CRF sequence labeling architecture proposed by Huang et. al (2015) in all configurations of our comparative evaluation. In this architecture, we evaluate our proposed contextual string embeddings in stacked combinations with the three types of previous embeddings discussed in Section 1; namely (1) pre-trained static ("classic") word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>), (2) tasktrained (i.e. not pre-trained) static character features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ma and Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al., 2016)</ref>, and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">(3)</ref> pre-trained contextual word embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Peters et al., 2018)</ref>. Baselines. We also evaluate setups that involve only previous word embeddings. These are effectively reimplementations of state-of-the-art approaches within our sequence labeling architecture. We conduct these experiments to isolate the impact of our proposed embeddings vis-a-vis earlier approaches. The setups are as follows: Proposed approach. We evaluate our proposed contextual string embeddings in the following configurations:</p><p>PROPOSED : The simplest setup of our proposed approach that relies solely on our proposed contextual string embeddings, passed to a standard BiLSTM-CRF architecture.

We also list the best published scores for each task for reference. We significantly outperform all previous works on NER, and slightly outperform the previous state-of-the-art in PoS tagging and chunking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Model Training and Parameters</head><p>Character-level language models. We train our LMs using SGD to perform truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT) with a window length of 250, a non-annealed learning rate of 20.0, a batch size of 100, clipping gradients at 0.25 and dropout probabilities of 0.25. We prepare the data by unking-the rarest 0.0001 percent of characters. We set the number of hidden states of the (one-layered) LSTM to 2048. We halt training by tracking the performance on the validation set, stopping when negligible gains were observed, or after 1 week, whichever came first. We train our English models on the 1-billion word corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chelba et al., 2013)</ref> and our German models on a corpus of half a billion words aggregated from various open source corpora in the OPUS project 2 . After training, we find the models trained for the full week achieve character level perplexity on the supplied test-set of 2.42 for English and 2.38 for German. Resources did not allow us to train for longer or on larger language model variants. We hypothesize that more resources and time would permit learning an even better model. Sequence tagging model. We train the sequence tagging model using vanilla SGD with no momentum, clipping gradients at 5, for 150 epochs. We employ a simple learning rate annealing method in which we halve the learning rate if training loss does not fall for 5 consecutive epochs. Following recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reimers et al. (2017)</ref>'s in-depth analysis of hyperparameters in sequence labeling, we utilize variational dropout, set the number of hidden states per-layer of the LSTM to 256, set the number of LSTM layers to 1, and perform model selection over the learning rate ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1} and mini-batch size ∈ {8, 16, 32}, choosing the model with the best F-measure (for NER and chunking) or accuracy (for PoS) in the best epoch as judged by performance on the validation set. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peters et al. (2017)</ref>, we then repeat the experiment for the model chosen 5 times with different random seeds, and train using both train and development set, reporting both average performance and standard deviation over these runs on the test set as final performance. Classic word embeddings. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reimers et al. (2017)</ref>, we use GLOVE embeddings for English NER and KOMNIOS embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Komninos and Manandhar, 2016)</ref> for PoS tagging and chunking. For German, we use the German FASTTEXT embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Grave et al., 2018)</ref>. In configurations that train character features, we apply a BiLSTM with 25 hidden states to each word separately and extract the final hidden output states (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al. (2016)</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>Our experimental results are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for each of the four tasks. We find that our approach either slightly or strongly surpasses all previously published results. This shows that our proposed contextual string embeddings are indeed highly useful for sequence labeling. In more detail, we make the following observations: New state-of-the-art for NER. We find that our approach performs particularly well on the task of named entity recognition. For English, we surpass the previous state-of-the-art approach by a significant margin (93.09 F1, ↑0.87 pp vs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Peters et al. (2018)</ref>). For German in particular, we significantly raise the state-of-the-art (88.33 F1, ↑9.56 pp vs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lample et al. (2016)</ref>). We hypothesize that pre-trained contextual character-level features are particularly helpful for this task, since entities are an open vocabulary of names that are often indicated by character features (such as capitalization or endings), as well as their contextual use. In addition, the CONLL03 shared task data set contains many sentences (such as article titles) that are in all-caps; since most traditional embeddings perform lower casing to manage vocabulary size, we assume that our character model can better capture the features of such sentences. Good performance on syntactic tasks. We also find that our approach slightly outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches for chunking and PoS tagging. We do not however see the same improvements as for NER, which we mainly attribute to the fact that syntactic tasks are already solved by current approaches to very high accuracy, making it difficult to record further strong improvements (see <ref type="bibr">Man- ning et al. (2014)</ref> for a discussion of this issue).</p><p>Traditional word embeddings helpful. Additionally, we observe that the added use of classic word embeddings in setup PROPOSED +WORD often produces the best results. Especially for NER, the use of classic word embeddings increases average F1 score by 1.1 pp to 93.07, compared with 91.97 for PRO-POSED. We hypothesize that classic word embeddings capture word-level semantics that complement the strong character-level features of our proposed embeddings. We therefore recommend the setup PROPOSED +WORD as default setup for sequence labeling tasks. Task-specific character features unnecessary. Another observation is that setups with task-specific character features (PROPOSED +CHAR and PROPOSED +WORD+CHAR ) do not perform better than those without. This indicates that they are largely subsumed by our proposed embeddings, and are thus no longer required. A positive side-effect of this is that this simplifies training of the sequence labeler (see Section 3.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Inherent Semantics</head><p>Quantiative investigation <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>. To gain additional insight into the content of the contextual string embeddings relative to the task, we replace the standard BiLSTM-CRF in the sequence labeling architecture with a direct feedforward map as per Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref>, with and without a CRF decoder. This simplified approach makes predictions directly on the basis of the proposed embeddings without additional learning of the BiLSTM recurrence. The results for this simplified architecture are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for the  setups PROPOSED and PROPOSED +WORD , as well as for a setup that involves only traditional word embeddings (GLOVE for English NER, KOMNIOS for English PoS and chunking, FASTTEXT for German NER). We find that the effect of removing the BiLSTM layer on downstream task accuracy is far lower for the proposed embeddings than for classic embeddings. For the setups PROPOSED and PROPOSED +WORD , we record only an average drop of 3% in F-score/accuracy between the BiLSTM-CRF and Map-CRF architectures. This stands in contrast to classic embeddings in which we find an average drop of 20% from BiLSTM-CRF to Map-CRF. This indicates that the inherent semantics of the proposed embeddings are meaningful enough as to require much less powerful learning architectures on top to perform downstream sequence labeling tasks. In particular, for PoS tagging, the simple feedforward map is competitive to BiLSTM and much more effective to train. Qualitative inspection <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 4)</ref>. To illustrate the contextualized nature of our proposed embeddings, we present example embeddings of the polysemous word "Washington" in different contexts. We compute contextual string embeddings for all words in the English CONLL03 corpus and compute nearest neighbors in the embedding space using the cosine distance. We then look up nearest neighbors for different mentions of the word "Washington".</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">word context selected nearest neighbors Washington (a) Washington to curb support for [..] (1) Washington would also take [..] action [..] (2) Russia to clamp down on barter deals [..] (3) Brazil to use hovercrafts for [..] Washington (b) [..] Anthony Washington (U.S.) [..] (1) [..] Carla Sacramento ( Portugal ) [..] (2) [..] Charles Austin ( U.S. ) [..]<label>(</label></formula><p>As <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows, the embeddings successfully pry apart person, place, legislative entity and team (a-d). For instance, "Washington" used as last name in context (b) is closest to other last names, many of which are also place names ("Carla Sacramento"); "Washington" used as a sport team name in context (d) is closest to other place names used in sports team contexts. We include a negative example (e) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> in which the context is not sufficient to determine the type of mention. We hypothesize that modeling semantics in context is a key feature that allows our proposed embeddings to better address downstream sequence labeling task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Discussion</head><p>Our proposed approach is one of the first to leverage hidden states from a language model to improve sequence labeling performance. Two prior works have suggested related approaches: The first is <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al. (2017)</ref> that jointly train a character-level language model together with the sequence labeling BiLSTM. In effect, this means that the language model is trained only on labeled task data and therefore has orders of magnitude fewer data available than our proposed approach (which we can pre-train on basically unlimited amounts of unlabled data). We hypothesize that this is the main reason for why our approach outperforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Liu et al. (2017)</ref> across all tasks.</p><p>A second approach is the method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peters et. al (2017)</ref> which proposed to extract hidden states from pre-trained word-level language models as features for downstream NLP tasks. They report new state-of-the-art results for NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Peters et al., 2018</ref>) and chunking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peters et al., 2017)</ref>, but require the training of massive word-level language models: their best configuration uses a language model that was trained for 5 weeks on 32 GPUs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jozefowicz et al., 2016)</ref>, and still requires lower casing of all words to deal with the large vocabulary size. Their approach is the strongest baseline against which we compared.</p><p>We similarly propose to utilize trained LMs to generate embeddings, but consider LM at the character level. This has a number of advantages: First, character-level LM is independent of tokenization and a fixed vocabulary. Second, they produce stronger character-level features, which is particularly useful for downstream tasks such as NER. Finally, such models have a much smaller vocabulary size (distinct characters vs. distinct words) and are thus significantly easier to train and deploy in applications: the LM parameter-count scales according to n layers n 2 hidden (not true for word-level LM since these contain many inputs) and may be trained in 1 week on 1 GPU (e.g. significantly less than the 5 weeks on 32 GPUs used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peters et al. (2017)</ref>). This allowed us to train models for other languages such as German with moderate resources, and thus allows our method to more effectively scale to new languages or domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed novel contextual string embeddings and a method for producing them using neural character LM. We find that they capture syntactic-semantic word features and disambiguate words in context, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in classic NLP sequence labeling tasks. To facilitate reproduction of our experiments, and enable application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks, we release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . Future work will focus on applying these embeddings to additional sentence level tasks such as image-retrieval and neural translation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>HUANG</head><label></label><figDesc>: A standard BiLSTM-CRF setup with pre-trained word embeddings, and thus a reimplemen- tation of Huang et al.
