<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We seek to automatically infer a dense depth image from a single color input image. Estimating absolute, or even relative depth, seems ill-posed without a second input image to enable triangulation. Yet, humans learn from navigating and interacting in the real-world, enabling us to hypothesize plausible depth estimates for novel scenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Generating high quality depth-from-color is attractive because it could inexpensively complement LIDAR sensors used in self-driving cars, and enable new single-photo applications such as image-editing and AR-compositing. Solving for depth is also a powerful way to use large unlabeled image datasets for the pretraining of deep networks for downstream discriminative tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. However, collecting large and varied training datasets with accurate ground truth depth for supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> is itself a formidable challenge. As an alternative, several recent self-supervised approaches have shown that it is instead possible to train monocular depth estimation models using only synchronized stereo pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> or monocular video <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Among the two self-supervised approaches, monocular video is an attractive alternative to stereo-based supervision, but it introduces its own set of challenges. In addition to estimating depth, the model also needs to estimate the egomotion between temporal image pairs during training. This typically involves training a pose estimation network that takes a finite sequence of frames as input, and outputs the corresponding camera transformations. Conversely, using stereo data for training makes the camera-pose estimation a one-time offline calibration, but can cause issues related to occlusion and texture-copy artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We propose three architectural and loss innovations that combined, lead to large improvements in monocular depth estimation when training with monocular video, stereo pairs, or both: (1) A novel appearance matching loss to address the problem of occluded pixels that occur when using monocular supervision. (2) A novel and simple automasking approach to ignore pixels where no relative camera Input Geonet <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> (M) <ref type="bibr">Ranjan</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> (M) EPC++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> (MS) Baseline (M) Monodepth2 (M) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.

Our method succeeds here where others, and our baseline with our contributions turned off, fail.</p><p>motion is observed in monocular training. (3) A multi-scale appearance matching loss that performs all image sampling at the input resolution, leading to a reduction in depth artifacts. Together, these contributions yield state-of-the-art monocular and stereo self-supervised depth estimation results on the KITTI dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and simplify many components found in the existing top performing models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>We review models that, at test time, take a single color image as input and predict the depth of each pixel as output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Supervised Depth Estimation</head><p>Estimating depth from a single image is an inherently illposed problem as the same input image can project to multiple plausible depths. To address this, learning based methods have shown themselves capable of fitting predictive models that exploit the relationship between color images and their corresponding depth. Various approaches, such as combining local predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, non-parametric scene sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, through to end-to-end supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> have been explored. Learning based algorithms are also among some of the best performing for stereo estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and optical flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</p><p>Many of the above methods are fully supervised, requiring ground truth depth during training. However, this is challenging to acquire in varied real-world settings. As a result, there is a growing body of work that exploits weakly supervised training data, e.g. in the form of known object sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, sparse ordinal depths <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, supervised appearance matching terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>, or unpaired synthetic depth data <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>, all while still requiring the collection of additional depth or other annotations. Synthetic training data is an alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, but it is not trivial to generate large amounts of synthetic data containing varied real-world appearance and motion. Recent work has shown that conventional structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines can generate sparse training signal for both camera pose and depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, where SfM is typically run as a pre-processing step decoupled from learning. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> built upon our model by incorporating noisy depth hints from traditional stereo algorithms, improving depth predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Self-supervised Depth Estimation</head><p>In the absence of ground truth depth, one alternative is to train depth estimation models using image reconstruction as the supervisory signal. Here, the model is given a set of images as input, either in the form of stereo pairs or monocular sequences. By hallucinating the depth for a given image and projecting it into nearby views, the model is trained by minimizing the image reconstruction error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-supervised Stereo Training</head><p>One form of self-supervision comes from stereo pairs. Here, synchronized stereo pairs are available during training, and by predicting the pixel disparities between the pair, a deep network can be trained to perform monocular depth estimation at test time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> proposed such a model with discretized depth for the problem of novel view synthesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> extended this approach by predicting continuous disparity values, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> produced results superior to contemporary supervised methods by including a left-right depth consistency term. Stereo-based approaches have been extended with semi-supervised data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, generative adversarial networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, additional consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, temporal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, and for real-time use <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we show that with careful choices regarding appearance losses and image resolution, we can reach the performance of stereo training using only monocular training. Further, one of our contributions carries over to stereo training, resulting in increased performance there too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-supervised Monocular Training</head><p>A less constrained form of self-supervision is to use monocular videos, where consecutive temporal frames provide the training signal. Here, in addition to predicting depth, the network has to also estimate the camera pose between frames, which is challenging in the presence of object motion. This estimated camera pose is only needed during training to help constrain the depth estimation network.</p><p>In one of the first monocular self-supervised approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> trained a depth estimation network along with a separate pose network. To deal with non-rigid scene motion, an additional motion explanation mask allowed the model to ignore specific regions that violated the rigid scene assumption. However, later iterations of their model available online disabled this term, achieving superior performance. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> proposed a more sophisticated motion model using multiple motion masks. However, this was not fully evaluated, making it difficult to understand its utility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> also decomposed motion into rigid and non-rigid components, using depth and optical flow to explain object motion. This improved the flow estimation, but they reported no improvement when jointly training for flow and depth estimation. In the context of optical flow estimation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> showed that it helps to explicitly model occlusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I t I t-1 I t+1</head><p>Recent approaches have begun to close the performance gap between monocular and stereo-based self-supervision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> constrained the predicted depth to be consistent with predicted surface normals, and [69] enforced edge consistency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> proposed an approximate geometry based matching loss to encourage temporal depth consistency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> use a depth normalization layer to overcome the preference for smaller depth values that arises from the commonly used depth smoothness term from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> make use of pre-computed instance segmentation masks for known categories to help deal with moving objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appearance Based Losses</head><p>Self-supervised training typically relies on making assumptions about the appearance (i.e. brightness constancy) and material properties (e.g. Lambertian) of object surfaces between frames. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> showed that the inclusion of a local structure based appearance loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> significantly improved depth estimation performance compared to simple pairwise pixel differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> extended this approach to include an error fitting term, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> explored combining it with an adversarial based loss to encourage realistic looking synthesized images. Finally, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> use ground truth depth to train an appearance matching term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>Here, we describe our depth prediction network that takes a single color input I t and produces a depth map D t . We first review the key ideas behind self-supervised training for monocular depth estimation, and then describe our depth estimation network and joint training loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Self-Supervised Training</head><p>Self-supervised depth estimation frames the learning problem as one of novel view-synthesis, by training a net-work to predict the appearance of a target image from the viewpoint of another image. By constraining the network to perform image synthesis using an intermediary variable, in our case depth or disparity, we can then extract this interpretable depth from the model. This is an ill-posed problem as there is an extremely large number of possible incorrect depths per pixel which can correctly reconstruct the novel view given the relative pose between those two views. Classical binocular and multi-view stereo methods typically address this ambiguity by enforcing smoothness in the depth maps, and by computing photo-consistency on patches when solving for per-pixel depth via global optimization e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>, we also formulate our problem as the minimization of a photometric reprojection error at training time. We express the relative pose for each source view I t , with respect to the target image I t 's pose, as T t→t . We predict a dense depth map D t that minimizes the photometric reprojection error L p , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L p = t pe(I t , I t →t ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I t →t = I t proj(D t , T t→t , K) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here pe is a photometric reconstruction error, e.g. the L1 distance in pixel space; proj() are the resulting 2D coordinates of the projected depths D t in I t and is the sampling operator. For simplicity of notation we assume the pre-computed intrinsics K of all the views are identical, though they can be different. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> we use bilinear sampling to sample the source images, which is locally sub-differentiable, and we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> in using L1 and SSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> to make our photometric error function pe, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">pe(I a , I b ) = α 2 (1 − SSIM(I a , I b )) + (1 − α) I a − I b 1 ,</formula><p>where α = 0.85. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> we use edge-aware smoothness  where d * t = d t /d t is the mean-normalized inverse depth from <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> to discourage shrinking of the estimated depth.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L s = |∂ x d * t | e −|∂xIt| + |∂ y d * t | e −|∂yIt| ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In stereo training, our source image I t is the second view in the stereo pair to I t , which has known relative pose. While relative poses are not known in advance for monocular sequences, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> showed that it is possible to train a second pose estimation network to predict the relative poses T t→t used in the projection function proj. During training, we solve for camera pose and depth simultaneously, to minimize L p . For monocular training, we use the two frames temporally adjacent to I t as our source frames, i.e. I t ∈ {I t−1 , I t+1 }. In mixed training (MS), I t includes the temporally adjacent frames and the opposite stereo view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Improved Self-Supervised Depth Estimation</head><p>Existing monocular methods produce lower quality depths than the best fully-supervised models. To close this gap, we propose several improvements that significantly increase predicted depth quality, without adding additional model components that also require training (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Per-Pixel Minimum Reprojection Loss</head><p>When computing the reprojection error from multiple source images, existing self-supervised depth estimation methods average together the reprojection error into each of the available source images.This can cause issues with pixels that are visible in the target image, but are not visible in some of the source images ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3(c)</ref>). If the network predicts the correct depth for such a pixel, the corresponding color in an occluded source image will likely not match the target, inducing a high photometric error penalty. Such problematic pixels come from two main categories: out-of-view pixels due to egomotion at image boundaries, and occluded pixels. The effect of out-of-view pixels can be reduced by masking such pixels in the reprojection loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>, but this does not handle disocclusion, where average reprojection can result in blurred depth discontinuities.</p><p>We propose an improvement that deals with both issues <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Auto-masking. We show auto-masks computed after one epoch, where black pixels are removed from the loss (i.e. µ = 0). The mask prevents objects moving at similar speeds to the camera (top) and whole frames where the camera is static (bottom) from contaminating the loss. The mask is computed from the input frames and network predictions using Eqn. 5.</p><p>at once. At each pixel, instead of averaging the photometric error over all source images, we simply use the minimum. Our final per-pixel photometric loss is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L p = min t pe(I t , I t →t ).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref> for an example of this loss in practice. Using our minimum reprojection loss significantly reduces artifacts at image borders, improves the sharpness of occlusion boundaries, and leads to better accuracy (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auto-Masking Stationary Pixels</head><p>Self-supervised monocular training often operates under the assumptions of a moving camera and a static scene. When these assumptions break down, for example when the camera is stationary or there is object motion in the scene, performance can suffer greatly. This problem can manifest itself as 'holes' of infinite depth in the predicted test time depth maps, for objects that are typically observed to be moving during training <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>). This motivates our second contribution: a simple auto-masking method that filters out pixels which do not change appearance from one frame to the next in the sequence. This has the effect of letting the network ignore objects which move at the same velocity as the camera, and even to ignore whole frames in monocular videos when the camera stops moving. Like other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, we also apply a per-pixel mask µ to the loss, selectively weighting pixels. However in contrast to prior work, our mask is binary, so µ ∈ {0, 1}, and is computed automatically on the forward pass of the network, instead of being learned or estimated from object motion. We observe that pixels which remain the same between adjacent frames in the sequence often indicate a static camera, an object moving at equivalent relative translation to the camera, or a low texture region. We therefore set µ to only include the loss of pixels where the reprojection error of the warped image I t →t is lower than that of the original, unwarped source image I t , i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ = min t pe(I t , I t →t ) &lt; min t pe(I t , I t ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where [ ] is the Iverson bracket. In cases where the camera and another object are both moving at a similar velocity, µ prevents the pixels which remain stationary in the image from contaminating the loss. Similarly, when the camera is static, the mask can filter out all pixels in the image ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). We show experimentally that this simple and inexpensive modification to the loss brings significant improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-scale Estimation</head><p>Due to the gradient locality of the bilinear sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and to prevent the training objective getting stuck in local minima, existing models use multi-scale depth prediction and image reconstruction. Here, the total loss is the combination of the individual losses at each scale in the decoder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> compute the photometric error on images at the resolution of each decoder layer. We observe that this has the tendency to create 'holes' in large low-texture regions in the intermediate lower resolution depth maps, as well as texture-copy artifacts (details in the depth map incorrectly transferred from the color image). Holes in the depth can occur at low resolution in low-texture regions where the photometric error is ambiguous. This complicates the task for the depth network, now freed to predict incorrect depths. Inspired by techniques in stereo reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, we propose an improvement to this multi-scale formulation, where we decouple the resolutions of the disparity images and the color images used to compute the reprojection error. Instead of computing the photometric error on the ambiguous low-resolution images, we first upsample the lower resolution depth maps (from the intermediate layers) to the input image resolution, and then reproject, resample, and compute the error pe at this higher input resolution ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (d)</ref>). This procedure is similar to matching patches, as low-resolution disparity values will be responsible for warping an entire 'patch' of pixels in the high resolution image. This effectively constrains the depth maps at each scale to work toward the same objective i.e. reconstructing the high resolution input target image as accurately as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Training Loss</head><p>We combine our per-pixel smoothness and masked photometric losses as L = µL p + λL s , and average over each pixel, scale, and batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Additional Considerations</head><p>Our depth estimation network is based on the general U-Net architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, i.e. an encoder-decoder network, with skip connections, enabling us to represent both deep abstract features as well as local information. We use a ResNet18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as our encoder, which contains 11M parameters, compared to the larger, and slower, DispNet and ResNet50 models used in existing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, we start with weights pretrained on Ima-geNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and show that this improves accuracy for our compact model compared to training from scratch ( <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Our depth decoder is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, with sigmoids at the output and ELU nonlinearities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> elsewhere. We convert the sigmoid output σ to depth with D = 1/(aσ + b), where a and b are chosen to constrain D between 0.1 and 100 units. We make use of reflection padding, in place of zero padding, in the decoder, returning the value of the closest border pixels in the source image when samples land outside of the image boundaries. We found that this significantly reduces the border artifacts found in existing approaches, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>For pose estimation, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and predict the rotation using an axis-angle representation, and scale the rotation and translation outputs by 0.01. For monocular training, we use a sequence length of three frames, while our pose network is formed from a ResNet18, modified to accept a pair of color images (or six channels) as input and to predict a single 6-DoF relative pose. We perform horizontal flips and the following training augmentations, with 50% chance: random brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue jitter with respective ranges of ±0.2, ±0.2, ±0.2, and ±0.1. Importantly, the color augmentations are only applied to the images which are fed to the networks, not to those used to compute L p . All three images fed to the pose and depth networks are augmented with the same parameters.</p><p>Our models are implemented in PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, trained for 20 epochs using Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, with a batch size of 12 and an input/output resolution of 640 × 192 unless otherwise specified. We use a learning rate of 10 −4 for the first 15 epochs which is then dropped to 10 −5 for the remainder. This was chosen using a dedicated validation set of 10% of the data.

We showed how together they give a simple and efficient model for depth estimation, which can be trained with monocular video data, stereo data, or mixed monocular and stereo data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Material</head><p>Note on arXiv versions In an earlier pre-print of this paper, 1806.01260v1, we included a shared encoder for pose and depth. While this reduced the number of training parameters, we have since found that we can gain even higher results with a separate ResNet pose encoder which accepts a stack of two frames as input (see ablation study in Section H). Since v1, we have also introduced auto-masking to help the model ignore pixels that violate our motion assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Odometry Evaluation</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> we evaluate our pose estimation network following the protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. We trained our models on sequences 0-8 from the KITTI odometry split and tested on sequences 9 and 10. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, the absolute trajectory error is then averaged over all overlapping five-frame snippets in the test sequences. Here, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> and others who use custom models for the odometry task, we use the same architecture for this task as our other results, and simply train it again from scratch on these new sequences.</p><p>Baselines such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> use a pose network which predicts transformations between sets of five frames simultaneously. Our pose network only takes two frames as input, and ouputs a single transformation between that pair of frames. In order to evaluate our two-frame model on the five-frame test sequences, we make separate predictions for each of the four frame-to-frame transformation for each set of five frames and combine them to form local trajectories. For completeness we repeat the same process with <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> predicted poses, which we denote as 'Zhou * '. As we can see in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, our frame-to-frame poses come close to the accuracy of methods trained on blocks of five frames at a time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Network Details</head><p>Except where stated, for all experiments we use a standard ResNet18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> encoder for both depth and pose networks. Our pose encoder is modified to accept a pair of frames, or six channels, as input. Our pose encoder therefore has convolutional weights in the first layer of shape 6×64×3×3, instead of the ResNet default of 3×64×3×3. When using pretrained weights for our pose encoder, we duplicate the first pretrained filter tensor along the channel dimension to make a filter of shape 6 × 64 × 3 × 3. This allows for a six-channel input image. All weights in this new expanded filter are divided by 2 to make the output of the convolution in the same numerical range as the original, one-image ResNet. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> we describe the parameters of each layer used in our depth decoder and pose network.

Additional Ablation Experiments</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> we show a full ablation study on our algorithm, turning on and off different components of the system. We confirm the finding of the main paper, that all our components together gives the highest quality model, and that pretraining helps. We observe in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> (d) that our results with ResNet 50 are even higher than our ResNet18 models. ResNet 50 is a standard encoder used by previous works e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. However, training with a 50-layer ResNet comes at the expense of longer training and test times.

Additional Evaluation D.1. Improved Ground Truth</p><p>As mentioned in the main paper, the evaluation method introduced by Eigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for KITTI uses the reprojected LI-DAR points but does not handle occlusions, moving objects, or the fact that the car is moving. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> introduced a set of high quality depth maps for the KITTI dataset, making use of 5 consecutive frames and handling moving objects using the stereo pair. This improved ground truth depth is provided for 652 (or 93%) of the 697 test frames contained in the Eigen test split <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We evaluate our results on these 652 improved ground truth frames and compare to existing published methods without having to retrain each method, see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. We present results for all other methods for which we have obtained predictions from the authors. We use the same error metrics from the standard evaluation, and clip the predicted depths to 80 meters to match the Eigen evaluation. We evaluate on the full image and do not crop, unlike with the Eigen evaluation. We can see that our method still significantly outperforms all previously published methods on all metrics. While Superdepth <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> comes a close second to our algorithm in the S category, they are run at high resolution (1024 × 384 vs. our 640 × 192), and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> we show that at higher resolutions our model's performance also increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.2. Single-Scale Evaluation</head><p>Our monocular trained approach, like all self-supervised baselines, has no guarantee of producing results with a metric scale. Nonetheless, we anticipate that there could be value in estimating depth-outputs that are, without special measures, consistent with each other across all predictions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, the authors independently scale each predicted depth map by the ratio of the median of the ground truth and predicted depth map -for each individual test im-age. This is in contrast to stereo based training where the scale is known and as a result no additional scaling is required during the evaluation e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. This per-image depth scaling hides unstable scale estimation in both depth and pose estimation and presents a best-case scenario for the monocular training case. If a method outputs wildly varying scales for each sequence, then this evaluation protocol will hide the issue. This gives an unfair advantage over stereo trained methods that do not perform per-image scaling.</p><p>We thus modified the original protocol to instead use a single scale for all predicted depth maps of each method. For each method, we compute this single scale by taking the median of all the individual ratios of the depth medians on the test set. While this is still not ideal as it makes use of the ground truth depth, we believe it to be fairer and representative of the performance of each method. We also calculated the standard deviation σ scale of the individual scales, where lower values indicate more consistent output depth map scales. As can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>, our method outperforms previously published self-supervised monocular methods, especially in the near range depth values i.e. δ &lt; 1.25, and is more stable overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.3. KITTI Evaluation Server Benchmark</head><p>Here, we report the performance of our self-supervised monocular plus stereo model on the online KITTI single image depth prediction benchmark evaluation server <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> uses a different split of the data, which is not the same as the Eigen split. As a result, we train a new model on the provided training data. At the time of writing, there were no published self-supervised approaches among the submissions on the leaderboard. Despite not using any ground truth data during training, our monocular only predictions are competitive with fully supervised methods, see <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>. Adding stereo data and a more powerful encoder at training time results in even better performance (Monodepth2  <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>. KITTI depth prediction benchmark. Comparison of our monocular plus stereo approaches to fully supervised methods on the KITTI depth prediction benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. D indicates models that were trained with ground truth depth supervision, while M and S are monocular and stereo self-supervision respectively.</p><p>(ResNet50)). Because the evaluation server does not do median scaling (required for monocular methods), we needed a way to find the correct scaling for our mono-only model, which makes unscaled predictions. We make predictions with our monomodel on 1,000 images from the KITTI training set which have ground truth depths available, and for each of the 1,000 images we find the scale factor which best align the depth maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Finally, we take the median of these 1,000 scale factors as the single factor which we use to scale all predictions from our mono model. Note that, to remain true to our 'self-supervised' philosophy, we never do any other form of validation, model selection or parameter tuning using ground truth depths. For comparison, we trained a version of the original Monodepth <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> using the online code 1 on the same benchmark split.</p></div>

In an earlier version of this paper, we proposed the use of a shared pose encoder that shared features with the depth network. This resulted in fewer parameters to optimize during training, but also results in a decrease in depth prediction accuracy, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 12</ref>. As a baseline we compare against the pose network used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, which builds upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> with an additional scaling of the translation by the mean of the inverse depth.

As with our KITTI experiments we train for 20 epochs with a batch size of 12, with a learning rate of 10 −4 which is reduced by a factor of 10 for the final 5 epochs.
