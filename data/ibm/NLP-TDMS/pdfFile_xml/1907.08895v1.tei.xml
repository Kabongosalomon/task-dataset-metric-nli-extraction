<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Video object segmentation is a fundamental task in video content analysis. It aims to assign a foreground/background label for each pixel in a video frame. Compared to image segmentation, there are two major differences in video object segmentation. First, the amount of data to be processed in video can be orders of magnitude greater than in image segmentation, placing greater constraints in terms of computational resources. Second, the temporal domain provides additional information about object motion that can judiciously be exploited to improve segmentation performance.</p><p>Video object segmentation approaches can be divided into two categories -semi-supervised and unsupervised. The semi-supervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> assume the foreground object in the first frame of test video is provided and the task is to segment the specified object in the following frames. On the other hand, the unsupervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> segment foreground objects without any prior knowledge, which is more suited for practical use.</p><p>In this paper, we approach the video object segmentation in the unsupervised setting. We propose an end-to-end encoder-decoder style 3D CNN based method to solve the video object segmentation problem efficiently. Its encoder is composed of a R2plus1D (R2P1D) network <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and a 3D pyramid pooling module. Its decoder is designed to recover both spatial and temporal dimensions to generate an output of the same size as the input clip. Instead of the popular two-stream framework, we adopt 3D CNN to aggregate spatial and temporal information. To efficiently process video, we propose 3D separable convolution for the pyramid pooling module and decoder, which dramatically reduces the number of operations while maintaining the performance. Additionally, we also extend our framework to video action segmentation by adding an extra classifier to predict the action label for actions in videos. The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:</p><p>1. We propose a simple yet efficient 3D CNN framework for action/object segmentation in videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time 3D CNN has been explored for video object segmentation to simultaneously model the spatial and temporal information in a video.</p><p>2. We evaluate our method on video object segmentation and action segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.</p><p>3. We conduct a detailed ablation study to identify the relative contributions of the individual components.</p></div>

Video should not be treated as a set of independent frames, since the connection between frames provides extra temporal information for understanding. Simonyan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> propose the two-stream CNN approach for action recognition, which consists of two CNNs taking image and optical flow as input respectively. To avoid computing optical flow separately, Tran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> propose 3D CNN for large scale action recognition. Hara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> apply 3D convolution on ResNet structure. Carreira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> propose I3D by extending Inception network from 2D to 3D and including an extra optical flow stream. Tran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and Xie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> factorize 3D CNN to treat spatial and temporal information separately to reduce the computational cost while keeping the performance.

The success of CNN-based approaches for image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> have led to dramatic advances in image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Many of the segmentation approaches leverage recognition models trained on ImageNet and replace the fully-connected layers with 1×1 kernel convolutions to generate dense (pixel-wise) labels. Recently, the encoder-decoder style network architecture, such as SegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, has been the main stream design for semantic segmentation. Moreover, pyramid pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> and dilated convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> are effective techniques to improve the segmentation accuracy. Our 3D CNN also builds upon the encoder-decoder structure for video object segmentation.</p><p>Video object segmentation. Video object segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> aims to delineate the foreground object(s) from the background in each frame. Semi-supervised segmentation pipelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> assume that the segmentation mask of the first frame in the sequence during testing is given, and exploit temporal consistency in video sequences to propagate the initial segmentation mask to subsequent frames.</p><p>In the more challenging unsupervised setting, as we address in this paper, no object mask is provided as initialization during the test phase. Unsupervised segmentation has been addressed by several variants of CNN-based models, such as the two-stream architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, recurrent neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> and multi-scale feature fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. These approaches generally perform much better than traditional clustering-based pipelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The core idea behind such approaches involves leveraging motion cues explicitly (via optical flow) using a two-steam network <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, and/or employing a memory module to capture the evolution of object appearance over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>Action segmentation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Generalizing CNN for Dense Prediction from 2D to 3D</head><p>Generalizing CNN framework from images (2D) to videos (spatio-temporal 3D) involves more work than simply adding one more dimension. A key challenge is due to the asymmetry between space and time. To address the change in apparent size of an object due to perspective, image pipelines crop and reshape images to a fixed size. One cannot do the same with videos since input videos and the duration of an object track or action in an untrimmed video can vary widely in the temporal dimension. Since an entire video cannot be rescaled to a fixed size, approaches typically process video as sequences of short (e.g. 8-frame) clips. In this section, we delve into the details of our network design to address these challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">3D separable convolution with dilation</head><p>3D CNN training is much less efficient than its 2D counterpart, since 3D kernels and feature maps have more parameters. To address pixel-level prediction in video more efficiently, we propose to use 3D separable convolution in lieu of the standard 3D convolution. 3D separable convolution factorizes a standard 3D convolution into a channel-wise 3D convolution and a point-wise 3D convolution with 1 × 1 × 1 kernel. The channel-wise convolution applies a specific filter to each input channel, then point-wise convolution combines the outputs of the channel-wise convolution via a 1 × 1 × 1 convolution. This factorization drastically reduces computation and model size.</p><p>A standard 3D convolutional operator takes a H × W × T × M feature map F as input and produces a H ×W × T × N feature map G, where H, W and T are the height, width and number of frames (duration) in a clip, respectively. M and N are the number of input/output channels. 3D convolution kernel has shape K h × K w × K t , where K h , K w and K t are the spatial and temporal dimensions of the kernel. The computation complexity of a standard  3D convolution is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H ×W × T × M × N × K h × K w × K t .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>On the other hand, 3D separable convolution is a two-step process. First channel-wise convolution generates the intermediate feature map by applying a specific filter to each input channel (M channels in total). The computational complexity of channel-wise convolution is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H ×W × T × M × K h × K w × K t .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the kernel of channel-wise convolution has size K h × K w × K t . Then point-wise convolution projects intermediate feature map to the final output with computational complexity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H ×W × T × M × N.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The computational cost of the standard 3D convolution is the multiplication of the feature map dimension (H,W, T ), input channel dimension M, output channel dimension N and kernel dimension (K h , K w , K t ); while in 3D separable convolution, channel-wise convolution is irrelevant to output filters and point-wise convolution is isolated from kernel dimension. Therefore, the computational cost reduction of 3D separable convolution is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H ×W × T × M × K h × K w × K t + H ×W × T × M × N H ×W × T × M × N × K h × K w × K t = 1 N + 1 K h × K w × K t .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For example, a 3D separable convolution with 3 × 3 × 3 kernel dimension and 512 input/output size only needs about 1/25 of computational resource compared to that of a standard 3D convolution, leading to significant inference computation reduction.</p><p>Meanwhile, in R2plus1D convolution, the standard 3D convolution is factorized into spacial and temporal convolutions. The input feature map with M channels passes through spatial convolution with kernel shape K h × Spatial Stride Temporal Stride <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: The network architecture of our method for video object segmentation. It has three components: an encoder (feature extractor), a pyramid pooling module and a decoder to recover the spatial-temporal details gradually. The encoder, shown in the top-left, takes pixel values as input, extracts features layer by layer, and generates rich contextual feature as the final output. Moreover, its intermediate results are merged with the decoder module. The pyramid pooling module connects the encoder and decoder modules. It varies the receptive field size by modifying the spatial stride. "S. 3D Conv" indicates the 3D separable convolution. "Frame level features" block is composed by a reduced average pooling and duplication to generate the frame level features with the same dimension as the other branches.</p><p>shape 1 × 1 × K t and generates the final output. Compared to standard 3D convolution, the computational cost reduction of R2plus1D convolution is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H ×W × T × M × M × K h × K w + H ×W × T × M × N × K t H ×W × T × M × N × K h × K w × K t = M N × K t + M M × K h × K w .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The computational reduction is depends on the number of intermediate filters M . According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the number of intermediate filters is set as M×N×K t ×K h ×K w N×K t +M×K h ×K w to keep the number of parameters the same as standard convolution.</p><p>Dilated convolution. Dilation rate γ a is an attribute of convolution operation. It has the ability to increase the receptive field size, while maintaining the computational cost by skipping γ a − 1 entities per valid one in one of dimensions (x, y, t). Adding dilation rates helps capture multi-scale feature representations. Specifically in 3D separable convolution, the dilation rate is only applied to channel-wise convolution, since kernel size of point-wise convolution is fixed at 1 × 1 × 1. Moreover, due to the asymmetry between space and time in video, dilation rate in 3D convolution can be divided into two parts -spatial rate γ s and temporal rate γ t . By using the dilation rate, the channel-wise convolution can be expressed as follows:Ĝ h,w,t,m = ∑ i, j,kK i, j,k,m · F h+γ s ·i,w+γ s · j,t+γ t ·k,m .</p><p>As shown in Eq. 6, the computational cost does not change by adding the dilation rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Network architecture</head><p>The proposed 3D CNN architecture for action/object segmentation in video is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The network builds upon an encoder-decoder structure for image semantic segmentation. A video is divided into 8-frame clips as input to the network. In the encoder module, 3D convolution are performed. To capture higher level information, the spatial and temporal sizes are reduced. In order to generate the pixel-wise segmentation map for each frame in the original size, 3D upsampling is used in the decoder module to increase the resolution of feature maps. To capture spatial and temporal information at different scales, a concatenation with the corresponding feature maps from the encoder module is employed after each 3D upsampling layer. Finally, a softmax cross entropy loss layer is used for pixelwise prediction (i.e. background or object foreground) for each frame in a clip.</p><p>In the encoder, we adopt R2plus1D <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> as feature extractor to leverage its pre-trained model on large scale action recognition dataset. We modify the last three groups of convolutional layers by adjusting the dilation rate to keep temporal stride as 4. We also insert a 3D pyramid pooling before the decoder. In the decoder, the up-sampling layer group is composed of a tri-linear interpolation layer, a 3D separable convolution layer as well as a feature concatenation layer incorporating encoder feature.</p><p>3D Pyramid Pooling. Compared to the 2D counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, pyramid pooling in 3D is more challenging. In spatial domain, multi-scale information should be captured. In temporal domain, detailed motion information should be preserved as well. Therefore, our 3D pyramid pooling has 5 branches. The details are listed as follows:</p><p>1. 3D separable convolutions with kernel size 3 × 3 × 3 and different spatial dilation rates γ s = 6, 12, 18. The convolutions with multiple spatial dilation rates are able to capture multi-scale information.</p><p>2. 3D separable convolution with kernel size 1 × 1 × 1 -a default layer for dense prediction.</p><p>3. There are two steps to get the frame feature. First, input is average pooled with kernel H ×W × 1. For the average pooling output, its spatial dimension is 1, while its temporal length and filter size are the same as those of the input. Then the average pooling output is upscaled to the input size.</p><p>By concatenating the 5 branches together, and applying a 1 × 1 × 1 convolution, the final output is obtained and fed into the decoder module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Implementation details. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed 3D CNN framework for action/object segmentation in videos, we evaluate our approach on two video object segmentation datasets -DAVIS'16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Segtrack-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and a video action segmentation dataset -J-HMDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We adopt R2plus1d encoder pretrained on Kinetics dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and leverage the Adam optimizer with initial learning rate 10 −4 , exponential decay rate 0.95 and decay step 1 epoch. The model is trained for 100 epochs with exponential decay. In 3D spatial pyramid pooling module, a large crop size is required to ensure the convolution kernel with spatial dilation rate is effective; otherwise, the filter weights with large dilation rate are mostly applied to the padded zero region. Therefore, We employ a spatial crop size of 384 during both training and testing. During training, we randomly scale the resolution of input clips with ratio [0.5, 2] and apply a random horizontal flip.</p><p>Experiments on DAVIS'16. Densely Annotated Video Segmentation 2016 (DAVIS'16) dataset is a benchmark dataset for video object segmentation. It consists of 50 videos with 3455 annotated frames. Consistent with most prior work, we conduct experiments on the 480p videos with a resolution of 854 × 480 pixels. 30 videos are used for training and 20 for validation. We adopt the same evaluation setting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. There are three parts. Region Similarity J , which is obtained by IoU (Intersection over Union) between the prediction and the ground-truth segmentation map. Contour Accuracy F measures the contours accuracy. Temporal Stability T tracks the temporal consistency in a video. For the first two evaluation, we report the mean, recall and decay. For the third one, we report the average.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Overall results of region similarity (J ), contour accuracy (F) and temporal stability (T ) for different approaches. ↑ means the higher the better, and ↓ means the lower the better.</p><p>We compare our results with several unsupervised approaches, since our approach does not require any manual annotation or prior information about the object to be segmented. We cannot compare directly to semi-supervised approaches that require the ground truth segmentation map in the first frame of each test video to be given. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the performance of our method against the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on DAVIS'16. Our method achieves the best performance in all performance metrics. Compared to ARP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised approach, our method achieves 5% gain in contour accuracy (F) and 15% gain in temporal stability (T ), demonstrating that 3D CNN can effectively take advantage of the temporal information in video frames to achieve temporal segmentation consistency. We also present the qualitative results on four video sequences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>.   <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Video object segmentation results on Segtrack-v2 dataset. We compare the performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. evaluation setting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and report the mean Intersection over Union. For videos with multiple instances with individual ground-truth segmentation mask, we group them as a single foreground for evaluation. Compared with other unsupervised video object segmentation methods, our proposed approach outperforms all of them (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref>). Experiments on J-HMDB. The J-HMDB dataset consists of 928 videos with 21 different actions. There are three train-test splits and the evaluation is done on the average results over the three splits. We leverage the mask annotation provided from J-HMDB dataset and train our semantic segmentation pipeline to segment the foreground action. Then the region with maximum area is selected through connected component <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. On the final feature map of each frame, we crop a box to tightly surround the selected foreground region and resize the box into a fixed shape. Finally, the cropped feature map goes through a classifier to predict action classes. We use softmax cross entropy loss to back propagate gradients for all the weights. For evaluation, we followed the metrics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Mean IoU is computed as the average over the IoU of each test sample. In addition, frame-level mean Average Precision (mAP) is evaluated as well. Since bounding boxes detection can be obtained by selecting the tightest rectangle region enclosing the segmentation mask, we are also able to compare with the state-of-the-art action detection approaches.</p><p>mean IoU frame-mAP (α = 0.5) Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> 48.8 -Gavrilyuk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> 54.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Comparison with the state-of-the-art action segmentation and detection approaches on J-HMDB.

It is evident that our method outperforms these methods considerably in evaluation metrics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> presents both action segmentation (in red) and bounding boxes detection (in yellow) results on several video sequences from J-HMDB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Ablation Study</head><p>To better understand the contribution of each component in our proposed approach, we conduct video object segmentation on DAVIS'16 with different settings, summarized in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>Dilation rate. We adopt R2Plus1D pre-trained model in our approach, and increase the feature map's temporal size of last two convolution layer group by specifying the dilation rate. As shown in first section of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, the performance is boosted by increasing the  number of frames in the final feature map. However, too large feature map (8 frames) will cause out of memory error, that is the reason we stop at 4 frames.</p><p>3D pyramid pooling. As shown in the second section of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, inserting 3D pyramid pooling module improves the segmentation accuracy by over 5%. We experiment multiple branches with different spatial dilation rates (as noted in the bracket). According to the experimental results, including more branches with larger receptive field (4 branches) or larger temporal stride is not helpful. When the receptive field size is close to or larger than the feature map size, most of the filters cannot capture any useful information, since they only cover padded zeros instead of valid area. Segmentation accuracy further improves when frame-level features are added.  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Ablation study of our method for video object segmentation on DAVIS-16. In the first horizontal section of the <ref type="table">Table,</ref> we investigate various temporal size of the final feature map by increasing the temporal dilation rate in the last two convolutional layer groups. In the second section of the <ref type="table">Table,</ref> we fix feature map dimensions (including temporal dimension) and explore different settings in 3D pyramid pooling module (shown in the second column), which includes various receptive fields and whether frame-level features (FF) are included or not. Specifically, the numbers in the parentheses () indicate spatial dilation rates of branches. We compare performance with different sizes of feature maps, with or without 3D pyramid pooling layer. Mean IoU is used as evaluation metric as shown in third column.</p><p>3D separable convolution. The proposed pipeline leverages 3D separable convolution in pyramid pooling and decoder. We perform an experiment by replacing all the 3D separable convolutions with R2plus1D convolutions and standard 3D convolutions. The comparison of performance and computational cost is shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. All the experiments are carried out on a workstation with a NVIDIA Titan XP GPU and PyTorch. We only take 3D pyramid pooling and decoder part during inference into computation cost, since all of them share the same pre-trained model. "Operations" counts the total number of additions and multiplications. "GPU Mem." is the size of allocated GPU memory. With the same input (a 8 frames clip with resolution 320 × 320), 3D separable convolution greatly reduces the computational cost without sacrificing the performance.</p></div>
