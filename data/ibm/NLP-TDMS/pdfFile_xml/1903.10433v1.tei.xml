<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social recommendation leverages social information to solve data sparsity and cold-start problems in traditional collaborative ltering methods. However, most existing models assume that social e ects from friend users are static and under the forms of constant weights or xed constraints. To relax this strong assumption, in this paper, we propose dual graph a ention networks to collaboratively learn representations for two-fold social e ects, where one is modeled by a user-speci c a ention weight and the other is modeled by a dynamic and context-aware a ention weight. We also extend the social e ects in user domain to item domain, so that information from related items can be leveraged to further alleviate the data sparsity problem. Furthermore, considering that di erent social e ects in two domains could interact with each other and jointly inuence users' preferences for items, we propose a new policy-based fusion strategy based on contextual multi-armed bandit to weigh interactions of various social e ects. Experiments on one benchmark dataset and a commercial dataset verify the e cacy of the key components in our model. e results show that our model achieves great improvement for recommendation accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.</p></div>

WWW <ref type="bibr">'</ref> when the information overload problem has been pervasive with the rapid development of the World Wide Web. Conventional collaborative ltering (CF) methods for recommendation su er from data sparsity and cold start problems. To this end, social recommendation, which a empts to leverage the social networks of users to incorporate more useful information, has been proposed to alleviate these two problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Prior Works and Limitations. Nowadays, there are many composite platforms which integrate item recommendation and social network services (SNS). Users on these platforms can click on or rate items as well as interact with their friends. A user's preference for one item could be impacted by her friends, which motivates us to probe into such social e ect to improve recommendation quality. Previous studies for social recommendation a empt to model social e ects in various ways, such as by trust propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, regularization loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, network embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, and deep neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Illustration of the two-fold social e ects, i.e., homophily e ect and in uence e ect, in user social networks as well as among related items. e four social e ects jointly a ect a user's decision on one item.</p><p>However, these studies share several common limitations. First, most studies assume that linked users all share similar preferences.</p><p>is assumption cannot suit well contemporary SNS since there could be various types of online friends, such as close friends, casual friends, and event friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. erefore, directly equating friendship on an SNS with preference similarity may not be sound.</p><p>Second, most works model friends' in uences statically under the forms of constant weights or xed constraints. is assumption ignores the dynamic pa ern of social e ects. In fact, users could be in uenced by a speci c group of friends when it comes to speci c items, which makes the social e ect dynamic and dependent of speci c contexts.</p><p>ird, previous methods lack interpretability for social e ects, i.e., they cannot explicitly indicate how a user's preference for one item is in uenced by their friends.</p><p>Motivations and Rationales. In the real world, people's decisions could be in uenced by various factors, and their behaviors are o en the results of multifaceted causes. To this end, we probe into four di erent social e ects in recommender systems, including two-fold e ects in user domain and the other symmetric two-fold ones in item domain, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. In user domain, friends could in uence each other in two ways. For one thing, users tend to possess similar preferences to their friends, which is called as social homophily <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1.(a)</ref>). Social homophily o en leads to intrinsic e ect for user preference which stays unchanged and independent of external contexts. For another, a user's friend who has purchased one item may recommend it to that user who then may be more likely to click such item, which is termed as social in uence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1.(b)</ref>). Actually, social in uence contributes to behavior-level e ect for user preference which may change dynamically with speci c contexts. For example, a commercial analyst may be in uenced by di erent communities of friends when it comes to an entertainment article or a commercial news. erefore, we can distinguish two components that may impact a user's preference: a static e ect from social homophily and a dynamic e ect from social in uence 1 , and we call corresponding user's preference as static and dynamic preference, respectively (le part of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, in item domain, there exist analogous 'social e ects'. For one thing, some related items tend to possess similar a ractiveness when exposed to users. We term this as item-to-item homophily, and call the component of an item a ribute a ected by such e ect as static a ribute ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1.(c)</ref>). For another, if one item is popular among a certain community, then other related items would become more likely to be clicked by users in this social group. Such phenomenon can be termed as item-to-item in uence, which depends on speci c contexts ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1.(d)</ref>). For example, a businessman and a researcher both read one article talking about the development of AI, but the businessman would prefer another article about nancial information of AI companies, while the researcher would tend to click on another article about cu ing-edge breakthroughs in AI. We call the component of an item a ribute a ected by such e ect as dynamic a ribute. Finally, as shown by 1 ∼ 4 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, the two-fold social e ects in both user domain and item domain may jointly in uence a user's decision on one item. Such phenomenon is pervasive on Epinion, Twi er, Facebook, and Net ix, etc.</p><p>Methodologies and Results. To these ends, in this paper, we propose DANSER (Dual graph A ention Networks for modeling multifaceted Social E ects in Recommender systems), a novel architecture that extends graph a ention networks (GAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. DANSER is composed of two dual GATs: one dual GAT for users-including a GAT to capture social homophily and a GAT to capture social in uence-and the other dual GAT for items. Speci cally, in user domain, one GAT to capture social homophily a entively aggregates adjacent users' embedding that re ects ones' preferences, and outputs representations for static user preference. Another GAT to capture social in uence aims at convolution on adjacent users' context-aware preferences, which characterize relevance of users' rated items to candidate item, and outputs representations for dynamic user preference. In item domain, two analogous GATs as a dual architecture are designed to model items' static and dynamic a ributes under e ects of item-to-item homophily and in uence, respectively, among related items. Such dual mechanism possesses two advantages: i) GATs to capture homophily and in uence could collaboratively model two-fold social e ects, taking advantage of both global and local views to investigate user-item interactions; ii) two GATs in item domain incorporate information from related items, which could further alleviate data sparsity problem. en, since user static (resp. dynamic) preference as well as item static (resp. dynamic) a ribute could jointly a ect a user's decision on one item (shown by 1 ∼ 4 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) and the importance of these four interactions would vary for distinct user-item pairs, we propose a policy-based strategy to dynamically weigh the four interactions. Speci cally, we model the problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and treat the weighing strategy as a policy conditional on the context (the targeted user-item pair). en our goal is to optimize a reward (w.r.t predicted loss). For model training, we use stochastic policy gradient to update our neural networkbased policy unit, and design a local-graph aware regularization technique to reduce computational cost for regularization. To verify our model, we conduct experiments on one benchmark datasets from Epinions and a commercial dataset from WeChat Top Story.</p><p>e results show that DANSER outperforms state-of-the-art models under both explicit feedback se ings (2.9% MAE improvement) and implicit feedback se ings (4.5% AUC improvement).</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows: i) General Aspects: We distinguish the social homophily and social in uence notions in view of static and dynamic e ects. Also, we extend the two-fold social e ects in user domain to item domain, and therefore investigate four social e ects in recommender systems. ese general aspects enable the model to capture more information and improve its capacity.</p><p>ii) Novel Methodologies: We propose DANSER with two dual GATs and a policy-based fusion unit. We are one of the rst to use GAT for social recommendation task, and the dual GATs can collaboratively model four social e ects in both user and item domains. e policy unit, based on a contextual multi-armed bandit, dynamically weighs four interactions of social e ects in two domains according to speci c contexts.</p><p>iii) Multifaceted Experiments: We deploy DANSER on one benchmark dataset and a commercial dataset. e experiment results verify the superiority of DANSER over state-of-the-art techniques, the e ectiveness of the proposed components, as well as its good interpretability for modeling social e ects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRELIMINARY AND BACKGROUND</head><p>In this paper, we consider a user-item interaction matrix R = {r ui } M ×N , where M and N are numbers of users and items respectively. For a recommender system with implicit feedback, R consists of 0 and 1, where r ui = 1 if user u has clicked item i, and r ui = 0 otherwise. For a recommender system with explicit feedback, r ui represents the rating value given by user u on item i (In Epinions, rating values range from 1 to 5 and user could give a high rating if she likes the item), and r ui = 0 if user u has not rated item i. We use R I (u) and R U (i) to respectively denote the set of items rated by user u and the set of users who have rated item i. Moreover, we assume the existence of a trust or friendship network for users, which is a graph G U = (V U , E U ) where V U is the set of users and E U is the set of edges that connect two users. We use F U (u) to denote the set of nodes adjacent to u in G U . Also, we consider interaction frequencies between user u and user as edge features, denoted by e u ∈ R C , where each element in e u denotes the frequency of one-type interaction between u and , and C is the number of interaction types. e edge features re ect link strengths between two users.</p><p>Problem Formulation. e social recommendation problem can be de ned as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>: given observed interaction records in R and trust relationship G U , we are to estimate unobserved interactions in R, i.e., the probability of a targeted user u + clicking an unobserved candidate item i + (for implicit feedback) or the rating value user u + will score item i + (for explicit feedback).</p></div>

Finally, we discuss two key units in our model for justi cation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> provides an overview of DANSER. We will go into the details of each part in order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model Framework</head><p>Raw Input and Item Implicit Network. e model requires user-item interaction matrix R and user social network G U as input. Social recommendation methods focus on leveraging the user social network to solve the data sparsity problem in recommender systems. Most existing methods treat items independently since there is no prior information that explicitly expresses the relationship between items. One way to calculate the similarity or relevance between two items is by the common users who clicked or rated them <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For any item i and item j, we de ne their similarity coe cient s i j as the number of users who clicked both items. ese coe cients induce an equivalence relation over items as follows: item i is related to item j if s i j &gt; τ with τ a xed threshold. We de ne the item implicit network as the graph G I = (V I , E I ) where V I is the set of items and E I is the set of edges that connects two related items.</p><p>Embedding Layer. e raw input of each user (resp. item) is a one-hot vector with high dimension, and the embedding operation is to project each user to a low-dimensional representation. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, each user can be represented by a user-speci c embedding and the items rated by her. e former representation re ects user's interests while the la er one (called item-based user embedding) captures implicit in uence of her rated history on current decision. Such embedding could deal with false-negative samples and improve model accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Similarly, each item can be represented by an item-speci c embedding and the users who rated it (called user-based item embedding).</p><p>For the user-speci c embedding, we de ne P = {p u } D×M , where D is the embedding dimension and p u denotes the embedding vector for user u. For the item-based user embedding, we de ne another embedding lookup Y = {y i } D×N , where y i denotes the item latent factor. en each item in R I (u) will be mapped via Y and outputs Y u = {y j |j ∈ R I (u)}, which will be used to compute the item-based user embedding, a D-dimensional vector representation, in the next layer. e user embeddings re ect a user's inherent preference (the 'inherent' notion emphasizes that it contains no social information and only depends on the user oneself). Similarly, for the itemspeci c embedding, we de ne Q = {q i } D×N , where q i denotes the embedding vector for item i. For user-based item embedding, we de ne X = {x u } D×M , where x u is user latent factor, and each user in R U (i) will be mapped via X and outputs X i = {x | ∈ R U (i)}, which will be used to compute user-based item embedding, a Ddimensional vector representation, in the next layer. Also, the item embeddings re ect item's inherent a ribute.</p><p>Dual GCN/GAT Layer. Graph convolution network (GCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> conducts local convolutional operation over neighbor nodes in graph and outputs a new representation for each node, in order to encode the graph structure information as low-dimensional node representations. Such operation can be viewed as an extension of convolution neural network (CNN) from a grid structure to general graphs. GCN equally aggregates the neighbors' embedding in each convolution and treats each neighbor nodes with equal importance. In contrast, Graph A ention Network (GAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> leverages a ention mechanism to consider di erent weights from neighbor nodes, which enables the model to lter out noises and focus on important adjacent nodes.</p><p>In order to exploit user social network G U and item implicit network G I , we propose dual graph a ention networks, an extension of GCN/GAT as a means to non-linearly aggregate the embeddings of the neighbor nodes in both networks, so that the social e ects from friends and related items can propagate to adjacent nodes through the graphs. As discussed in Section 1, we can distinguish two types of social e ects for users (resp. items) in social recommender systems: homophily e ect and in uence e ect. ey jointly a ect user preferences and item a ributes in di erent ways. DANSER uses two dual GATs to collaboratively learn di erent deep representations for user static/dynamic preference and item static/dynamic a ribute.</p><p>I. GAT to capture social homophily (marked as blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Firstly, via user embedding, we have P as representation of inherent user preference factor. en the GCN/GAT operation could output a new representation, the user static preference factor P * , by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P * = σ (A P (G U )PW T P + b P ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where σ , W P , b P are activation function, weight matrix, bias vector respectively, and P * is the updated representation of users, which incorporates social information by using the a ention weights</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A P (G U ) = {α P u } M ×M obtained from G U .</formula><p>Its elements are de ned as follows: i) e model requires user-item interaction records and user social network as raw input. We use common users who rate both items to calculate the item-item relevance and link the related items to form an item implicit network (the dotted lines between items). ii) In the embedding layer, we represent one user (resp. item) as a low-dimensional embedding vector and a latent factor. Besides, interaction frequencies between users are used as edge features. iii) In the dual GCN/GAT layer, four di erent graph attention networks are to capture the two two-fold social e ects, where the upper (resp. lower) two of them output representations for user (resp. item) static and dynamic preferences (resp. attributes) under the e ect of homophily and in uence, respectively. iv) ese four deep factors will be pairwisely combined as four interacted features, which are then fed into four independent neural networks to obtain more condensed representations. v) en a policy net with the input of item i + 's and user u + 's embeddings as context information outputs weights for four interacted features, which will be aggregated as one synthetic vector. vi) Finally, the synthetic vector is input into the output layer to give the nal predicted</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">α P u = attn U (W P p u , W P p , W E e u ) w ∈Γ U (u) attn U (W P p u , W P p w , W E e u ) , ∈ Γ U (u),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">scorer u + i + . where W E is weight matrix, Γ U (u) = {u} ∪ F (u), attn U (x, , z) = Leak ReLu(w T U z ⊗ (x || ))</formula><p>, and w U is weight vector. Here ⊗ and || denote the element-wise product and concatenation, respectively. Note that the above GAT weight α P u remains unchanged given user u and , which means factor matrix P * is xed for users. is design conforms to the intuition that social homophily contributes to static e ect for user's preference, this is why we call it static preference factor.</p><p>II. GAT to capture social in uence (marked as yellow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref>. In contrast to social homophily, social in uence e ect is o en contextaware, and the model needs to output di erent a ention weights for friends w.r.t di erent candidate items. rough the embedding layer, we have Y u as the embedding of the items clicked by user u. en we let each item clicked by user u interact with candidate item i + ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y i + u = {y j ⊗ y i + |j ∈ R I (u)}.</formula><p>is product operation can help to focus on the candidate item and model dynamic social in uence under a speci c context. We de ne the item-based user embedding M i + = {m i + u } D×M , which depends on candidate item i + with max pooling to select the most dominating features for D dimensions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m i + ud = max j ∈R I (u) { jd · i + d } ∀d = 1, . . . , D</formula><p>where m i + ud , i + d , and jd are the d-th feature of m i + u , y i + , y j respectively. e max pooling operation can help to focus on the most important value and alleviate noises in users' clicked history. e item-based embedding m i + u includes two information: i) user u's context-aware preference (w.r.t candidate item i + ), and ii) inherent representation for u (independent of social information). In order to de ne the user dynamic preference factor M * i + , we proceed to incorporate the social information from friend users,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M * i + = σ (A M (G U )MW T M + b M ), A M (G U ) = {α M u ,i + } M ×M , α M u ,i + = attn U (W M m i + u , W M m i + , W E e u ) w ∈Γ U (u) attn U (W M m i + u , W M m i + w , W E e u )</formula><p>, for ∈ Γ U (u). Note that the above a ention weight α M u ,i + depends on the user's history of rated items as well as speci c candidate item i + , which indicates that factor matrix M * i + would change dynamically with di erent contexts. is design conforms to the intuition that social in uence contributes to context-aware e ect for a user's preference, so we term it as dynamic preference factor.</p><p>III. GAT to capture item-to-item homophily (marked as green in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). Similarly, we use the item embedding Q as representation of inherent item a ribute factor, and then leverage GAT to incorporate social information,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q * = σ (A Q (G I )QW T Q + b Q ), A Q (G I ) = {α Q i j } N ×N , α Q i j = attn I (W Q q i , W Q q j ) k ∈Γ I (i) attn I (W Q q i , W Q q k ) , j ∈ Γ I (i),</formula><p>where attn I (x, ) = Leak Relu(w T I (x || )), and w I is a weight vector. e GAT weight α Q i j remains unchanged given item i and j. Correspondingly, item-to-item homophily contributes to static e ect for item's a ribute, and we call it static a ribute factor.</p><p>IV. GAT to capture item-to-item in uence (marked as red in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2</ref>). We now model item-to-item in uence, which is context-aware and depends on the speci c targeted user. Hence, our model needs to output di erent a ention weights for distinct related items w.r.t di erent targeted users. Similarly to social in uence, the user-based item representation N u + = (n u + i ) D×N for a given targeted user u + can be de ned as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">X u + i = {x ⊗ x u + | ∈ R I (i)}, n u + id = max ∈R U (i) {x d · x u + d } ∀d = 1, . . . , D, where n u + id , x u + d , and x d are the d-th feature of n u + i , x u + ,</formula><p>x respectively. en the representation for item dynamic a ribute N * u + can be computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">N * u + = σ (A N (G U )N u + W T N + b N ), A N (G U ) = {α N i j,u + } N ×N , α N i j,u + = attn(W N n u + i , W N n u + j ) k ∈Γ I (i) attn(W N n u + i , W N n u + k )</formula><p>, j ∈ Γ I (i).</p><p>Pairwise Neural Interaction Layer. Since user's decision on one item o en depends on both user preference and item a ribute, we can let two preference factors and two a ribute factors pairwisely interact with each other. en we borrow the idea from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, feeding the four results into di erent neural networks indexed by a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">s a = ϕ a K (· · · ϕ a 2 (ϕ a 1 (z 0 [a]))), ϕ a k (z k −1 ) = tanh(W a k z a k −1 + b a k ), k ∈ [1, K − 1], z 0 = [p * u ⊕ q * i , p * u ⊕ n * i , m * u ⊕ q * i , m * u ⊕ n * i ]</formula><p>, Here we employ a tower structure for each network, where higher layers have smaller number of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Policy-Based Fusion Layer. We further fuse the four interacted features s a into a synthetic one. Note that homophily e ect and in uence e ect could jointly a ect user preference and item a ribute, but for distinct users and items, the importance of the two-fold social e ects could be di erent. To this end, we propose a new policy-based fusion strategy to dynamically allocate weights to the four interacted features according to speci c user-item pairs.</p><p>We model the weight allocation as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>,where an action, denoted by γ ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, indicates which feature to choose, a context is a user-item pair and the reward a er playing an action represents a recommendation loss. In this problem, a stochastic policy can be wri en as the conditional probability p(γ |p u , q i ), which could characterize the selecting probability or importance weights for di erent combinations of social e ects given a speci c pair (u, i).</p><p>To make the problem solvable, we approximate p(γ |p u , q i ) by a neural network (called policy network):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">e γ = W 2 F tanh(W 1 F (p u ||q i ) + b 1 F ) + b 2 F . p(γ |p u , q i ) = exp(e γ ) 4 a=1 exp(e a )</formula><p>. en the synthetic representation can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">s = E γ ∼p(γ |p u ,q i ) (s γ ) = 4 γ =1 p(γ |p u , q i ) · s γ .</formula><p>We call the above strategy single-headed policy-based fusion. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, we can extend it to a multi-headed version. We harness L di erent independent policy networks and the nal weights are given by the averaged weights given by each policy net. e training of policy networks is by stochastic policy gradient, which will be discussed in Section 3.2. Output Layer. en probability of user u clicking item i can be predicted byr ui = nn(s).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Training</head><p>In this subsection, we introduce some training techniques to improve the model performance.</p><p>Mini-Batch Training. We also leverage mini-batch training to calculate the gradient. For each iteration, we consider B useritem pairs. For each pair (u, i), the neighbor nodes F U (u), F I (i) in two networks as well as the rated history R I ( ), ∈ Γ U (u), and R U (j), j ∈ Γ I (i) will be together input into the model to compute the gradient. Once an epoch is nished, the batch partition will be randomly reset to incorporate enough noise during optimization. In each mini-batch, since numbers of friends are di erent for users, we need to pad zeros and input a matrix with dimension of max friend number in one batch. We observe that number of friends tends to obey a long-tail distribution, so the padding would lead to both high space and time complexity. erefore, we use a sample technique: 1) for friend number more than F , we uniformly sample F friends as input data; 2) for friend number less than F , we pad zeros to obtain a F -dimensional vector. We also experiment other sample methods like random walk with restart (RWR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> on a sub-graph near central node, but we nd that uniformly sampling over adjacent nodes can achieve competitive performance. is observation could be justi ed by one argument in sociology research that in uence from users always propagates to adjacent users in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. us we adopt the simpler method to reduce time complexity. In experiment part, we will investigate the impact of sample size F on the performance.</p><p>Local-Graph Aware Regularization. e other issue is regularization to avoid over-ing problem. In our model, we adopt L1 regularization to constrain the embedding parameters to sparse forms. e regularization loss can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L 2 = u ( p u + x u ) + i ( q i + i ).</formula><p>However, the above loss introduces high computational complexity, since for each batch training we need to calculate the gradient of regularization over all users and items. Such operation can not generalize to large-scale data set. A recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> proposes a mini-batch aware regularization trick to solve this problem. In each batch training, only the embedding parameters for user-item pair (u, i) in the batch will be used to calculate the regularization loss. Here we extend this idea to graph structure and call it as local-graph aware regularization. In each batch training, we constrain the embedding parameters of users, items as well as their neighbor nodes in social network and item implicit network. e new regularization loss can be wri en as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L 2 = 1 2 (u,i) p u + x u + ∈Γ U (u) 1 |F U ( )| ( p + x ) + q i + y i + j ∈Γ I (i) 1 |F I (j)| ( q j + y j ) .</formula><p>In fact, the local-graph aware regularization is to split the regularization loss into small parts for each mini-batch and guarantees that once an epoch is nished, each user and each item can be regularized equally. To sum up, the nal loss function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L = L 1 + λL 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ is a trade-o parameter between accuracy and complexity. Besides, for parameters in neural networks (weight matrix and bias vectors), we adopt dropout strategy to replace the traditional regularization. Our experiments will further discuss the in uence of di erent dropout probabilities ρ.</p><p>Policy Gradient. In training stage, we train the policy networks in a stochastic way. Assume p l (γ |p u , q i ) to be the active probability given by l-th policy network, and random variable γ obeys a multinomial distribution. For each policy network, we draw γ ∼ Multi(p l (γ |p u , q i )), and feed s γ into output layer, which gives prediction and returns loss. We leverage the loss to train the policy network. is design can be formulated as an actor-critic terminology: i) given the environment (user u and item i), the l-th agent (policy net) needs to execute an action according to policy (p l (γ |p u , q i )); ii) every action would generate a reward (recommendation loss) that could lead the training of policy network. We de ne the reward as subtraction of loss generated by selected interacted feature, i.e., R(p u , q i , γ ) = −L(s γ ) (where L(s γ ) denotes the loss when we input s γ into the output layer). We aim at maximizing the expected reward E γ ∼p(γ |p u ,q i ) (R(p u , q i , γ )). e policy gradient method REINFORCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> can be used to update parameters in one policy network (denoted as θ ), and the gradient can be derived as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">∇ θ E γ ∼p θ (γ |p u ,q i ) (R(p u , q i , γ )) 1 4 γ ∇ θ log p θ (γ |p u , q i )R(p u , q i , γ ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Training Algorithm. e training of DANSER updates policy networks and feedforward networks (including embedding, dual GAT, pairwise neural interaction and output layers) iteratively, which is presented in Alg. 1. First, we update feedforward networks for n p steps (one mini-batch for one step) by optimizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. en we train L policy networks independently by conducting corresponding policy gradient (3). (γ |p u ,q i ) (R(p u , q i , γ )), l = 1, · · · , L;</p><p>Complexity Analysis. Since complexity and scalability are two important concerns for graph algorithm, we investigate complexity of DANSER for model training and inference respectively. For training, we need to update embedding of all friend users and related items for B user-item pairs in one batch, which requires time complexity O(BFCD), where C = max{|R I ( )|| ∈ Γ U (u)} ∪ {|R U (j)||j ∈ Γ I (i)}. We can control C to a limited value by truncating recent C t rated items for users. e friend number F is controlled by our sample method. Also, for inference, we need O(BFCD) to compute GAT representations. Hence, DANSER can scale linearly w.r.t number of user-item interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussions</head><p>In this subsection, we discuss on e ectiveness of our key units, dual GAT layer and policy-based fusion layer, in order to shed more insights on DANSER.</p><p>Justi cation of Dual GATs. During the training process, the GAT to capture the homophily e ect would give larger weights to friends whose preferences for items are globally similar to the targeted user (resp. related items whose a ractiveness to users are globally similar to candidate item), so the static preference (resp. a ribute) factor captures static e ect of friend users (resp. related items) from a global view. Di erently, the weights given by the GAT to capture the in uence e ect depend on the targeted user (resp. item), so the corresponding dynamic factor captures context-aware e ects from a local view. In each domain, a dual GAT collaboratively models the two-fold e ects and takes both global and local views to conduct a more accurate investigations into distinct users and items.</p><p>To put it more symbolically, we illustrate its e ectiveness by considering the following two cases for the recommendation of candidate item i + to targeted user u + : item i + is similar to item i 1 and i + is similar to i 2 (see le and right columns of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>Here, we assume that user u + has only clicked on i 1 and i 2 (and no other items), and users u 1 to u 4 are u + 's friends. Previous works for social recommendation consider static e ect of friends in an average manner. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3.(a)</ref>, for friend u 1 who clicked on both items, the a ention weight would be large, and the opposite for friend u 4 . For u 2 and u 3 , their weights are medium since they are both partially similar to u + . erefore static weights cannot discriminate between the in uence of user u 2 and u 3 when it comes to item i + even if it is known that it is similar to i 1 or i 2 . In contrast, DANSER contains two di erent a ention weights, where one captures user-speci c static e ect (for homophily) and the other can dynamically change under di erent contexts (i.e., for in uence). When candidate item i + is similar to i 1 (resp. i 2 ), the social in uence GAT would focus more on u 1 and u 2 (resp. u 1 and u 3 ). en the resultant force of the two GATs would make u + pay more a ention to u 2 when i + is similar to i 1 and to u 3 in the other case. e global and local views of DANSER work collaboratively for selecting the 'right' neighbors that are similar to the targeted user under a speci c context, which improves model expressiveness. In Section 4.5, we will verify the above argument via a real-case study.</p><p>Justi cation of Policy-Based Fusion. e policy-based fusion layer acts like a stochastic network while training, and the REINFORCE algorithm can help to explore the optimal weights distribution over four interacted features. Since the interacted feature with larger active probability is more likely to be selected, it would be more frequent for the interaction neural layer that gives the 'best' feature to be trained. Such mechanism brings up two major bene ts. Firstly, the policy networks can lter 'right' user-item samples for training of corresponding interaction neural layer as well as previous GCN/GAT and embedding layers. Second, the active probability introduces random pa ern to the training process, which can help to escape from local optimums. Our ablation study in experiment part also validate the superiority of the policy-based fusion compared with other straightforward strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>To comprehensively evaluate proposed model DANSER 2 , we conduct experiments to answer the following research questions: RQ1 How does DANSER perform compared with state-of-the-art models for recommendation and social recommendation? RQ2 Are the key components in DANSER, such as dual GATs and policy-based fusion, necessary for improving performance? RQ3 How do hyper-parameters in DANSER impact recommendation performance? RQ4 How can DANSER interpret the four di erent social e ects from real-world data?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment Setup</head><p>4.1.1 Data sets. We apply our model to one public benchmark datasets for social recommendation Epinions and a commercial dataset WeChat Top Story. We provide some statistics of these two datasets in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. e basic information about the two datasets is summarized as follows: i) Epinions: Epinions is a consumer review websites, where users can rate some items and add other users in their trust lists. Epinions dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> contains two parts of information: user-item interaction pairs, where items are rated from 1 to 5 (explicit feedback), as well as the directed trust relationships between users. e dataset has been widely used as benchmarks for social recommendation. Following other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, we randomly choose 80% user-item interactions as training set and the remaining 20% as test set for each dataset.</p><p>ii) WeChat:</p><p>We also deploy our model on a real-world article recommender system, WeChat Top Story. is dataset is constructed by user-article clicking records on this platform. Di erent from Epinions, this dataset only contains implicit feedback, i.e., we only know whether a user clicked an article or not. Besides, the friend relationships are bidirectional. We chronologically order the userarticle clicking records, and use the rst 90% records to train our model and the remaining records to evaluate the prediction performance. Since the positive samples and negative samples are fairly unbalanced in this dataset, we uniformly sample the negative ones such that the numbers of positive and negative samples are the same for one user. 4.1.2 Implementation Details. We use Tensor ow to implement our model and deploy it on GTX 1080 GPU with 8G memory. e hyper-parameter se ings for Epinions are as follows: batch size B = 64, embedding dimension D = 10, dropout ratio τ = 0.5, regularization coe cient λ = 0.001, sample size F = 30, truncation length C t = 30, multi-head number L = 4, policy gradient period n p = 1000. e learning rates η = 0.1, ζ = 0.01. e Leaky ReLu slope is 0.2. In pairwise interaction neural layer, we adopt threelayer neural networks and neuron numbers are 10 − 16 − 8 − 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Competitors.</head><p>We choose several comparative methods, including some state-of-the-art models for recommendation and social recommendation, to evaluate the performance of our DANSER. e optimal hyper-parameter se ings for each method are determined either by our experiments or suggested by previous works. e recommendation models include SVD++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and DELF <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. ese two methods only leverage user-item interactions as model input. ey can be used to evaluate the e ectiveness of other models that use social information.</p><p>• SVD++ [15] is a basic model-based recommendation method which use both user-speci c and item-based user embedding to represent user's preferences.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">• DELF [2]</formula><p>is a state-of-the-art CF method which proposes dual embedding for users and items, and adopts deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear information.</p><p>e social recommendation models include TrustPro, TrustMF, TrustSVD, NSCR, SREPS. ese methods all leverage both user-item interactions and user friendships as input information.</p><p>• TrustPro [37] is a trust propagation method, using rating of friends to deduce rating of targeted user. • TrustMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, as one matrix factorization method, optimizes user embedding to retrieve the trust matrix. • TrustSVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is another matrix factorization-based method, incorporating friends' embedding vectors into targeted user's predicted rating. • NSCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, as a strong baseline for social recommendation, adopts deep neural networks to learn latent representations of users and items, and leverages graph regularization to constrain the embedding of adjacent users to be similar. • SREPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is another strong baseline, using a network embedding approach to encode social network.</p><p>We also construct several variants of DANSER as ablation study. To evaluate the necessity of dual GAT layer, we simplify our model as DualEMB, DualGCN, userGAT, and itemGAT. DualEMB removes the convolution over adjacent nodes, while DualGCN replace GAT by GCN. userGAT removes two GATs in item domain, and itemGAT removes two GATs in user domain. Moreover, to evaluate the necessity of policy-based fusion layer, we consider the following variants. DANSER-m and DANSER-a leverage max and average pooling to fuse four interacted features, respectively. DANSER-c concatenates the four interacted features as the input of output layer. DANSER-w removes the policy net, set four sharing fusion weights, and update the weights together with training of feedforward networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Evaluation Protocol.</head><p>We adopt di erent metrics to evaluate recommendation performance. Since two datasets possess di erent feedbacks, we consider di erent metrics for them. For Epinions with explicit feedback, we use MAE and RMSE, which are widely adopted by other works, as evaluation metrics. For WeChat with implicit feedback, we use Precision@k (short as P@k) and AUC, two universally acknowledged metrics for 0-1 classi cation, to evaluate the performance. We repeated each experiment ten times and report the average performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparative Results: RQ1</head><p>We report experiment results of DANSER and other comparative methods in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. As we can see, our model DANSER outperforms other comparative methods and achieves great improvements, i.e., 2.87% MAE impv. for Epinions and 4.48% AUC impv. for WeChat. e results verify the superiority of proposed model for social recommendation. Also, there are some ndings in these comparative experiments. First, matrix factorization methods like TrustMF and TrustSVD can achieve good accuracy in Epinions with explicit feedback, but perform poorly in WeChat with implicit feedback. Second, NSCR performs quite be er than other linear methods, which indicates that neural network plays an important role in capturing complex non-linear information. ird, even though DELF has not leveraged any social information, it outperforms some social recommendation methods like TrustSVD and NSCR. is is possibly due to the facts: i) the dual embedding and neural interaction layer in DELF can be er exploit information in user-item interactions; ii) other social recommendation methods like TrustSVD and NSCR do not make good use of social information. Indeed, TrustSVD assumes equal importance of each friend user while NSCR uses graph regularization that constrains representations for adjacent users in a static way. ese se ings resort to a prior assumption that friend users' preferences are all similar, which may not be true for contemporary SNS (also discussed in Section 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Study: RQ2</head><p>In order to verify the e ectiveness of some components in our model, we do some ablation studies and the results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. We rst compare DANSER with DualEMB and DualGCN. As we can see, GCNs can capture enough social information hidden in graph structure and improve recommendation accuracy (about 1.0% impv. for MAE over DualEMB), while GATs can further improve performance by di erentiate importance weights for friend users (about extra 0.8% impv. for MAE over DualGCN). We secondly compare DANSER with userGAT and itemGAT. e results show that incorporation of user and item networks can both bring signi cant performance improvement, and the bene ts brought by user social network are greater.</p><p>We also evaluate the necessity of policy-based fusion layer. e results show that our policy-based fusion and policy gradient method can improve the accuracy a lot. Also, for Epinions, the improvement is quite signi cant. One possible reason is that the social e ects in Epinions are more heterogeneous than those in WeChat, so to dynamically weigh di erent social e ects are more e ective for Epinions. More importantly, since DualEMB can be seen as the extension of DELF <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where we replace the concatenation of four embedding by our policy unit. Comparing DualEMB in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> with DELF in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we nd that the policy unit do help to improve its performance and is superior to straightforward concatenation. In Section 1, we emphasized that social recommendation is proposed to solve the data sparsity and cold-start problem in recommender systems. Here we would like to investigate the performance of DANSER for cold-start users. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> shows the results on Epinions and WeChat for users with di erent number of clicked items and friends. We present the median, the 75− and 25−percentile MAE/AUC. As we can see, with number of clicked items increasing, the gap between upper and lower bounds becomes narrow, which indicates that performance becomes be er. Generally, DANSER can achieve be er overall performance as well as lower variation of MAE/AUC. For users with di erent friend numbers, as depicted in the gure, when friend number goes up, the variation trends for three methods are di erent. For DualEMB, the performance improves a li le. For DualGCN, there is an obvious performance decline, while performance of DANSER becomes be er.</p><p>is is possibly because for users with large number of friends, the GCN operation may incorporate more misleading information, and instead, GAT can a entively lter the noise and concentrate more on important neighbor nodes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parameter Sensitivity: RQ3</head><p>We study the performance variation for our model w.r.t some hyper-parameters including regularization parameter λ, dropout rate ρ, embedding dimension D, sample size F . ( e other hyperparameters have li le impact on model performance, so we skip discussions on them for space limit.) e results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.  5</ref> and enlighten us that. i) e regularization parameter plays an important role, and if it is too large, the model cannot focus on minimizing the recommendation loss. ii) If the dropout ratio is too large, the random pa ern would hinder the training. If ρ is too small, it would lose the regularization e cacy. iii) A proper embedding size is needed. If it is too small, the model lacks expressiveness, while if it is too large, the representation vector would become so sparse, which leads to performance decline. iv) With the sample size increasing, the accuracy improves but the computational cost increases as well. Hence an appropriate sample size can keep a good balance between complexity and accuracy. </p></div>

Moreover, in uence GATs incline to allocate larger weights to nodes with the same labels, which echoes the argument in Section 3.3 that the in uence GATs tend to concentrate more on the similar nodes under a speci c context.

Using GCN and GAT to solve semi-supervised classi cation problem in graph could achieve state-the-of-art performance (GAT can be seen as an extension of GCN and provide be er performance according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>), and its good scalability enables it to tackle large-scale dataset. Existing studies leverage GAT to tackle social in uence analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, graph node classi cation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, conversation generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, relevence matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. For recommendation, some recent studies like <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> adopt GCN to convolve on user-item network (a bipartite graph) to obtain be er representations for items, and there are also some works using GCN to capture social information for recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. We are the rst to use GAT for social recommendation task, and our new architecture, dual GATs, can capture social information in both user and item networks.</p><p>Dual Mechanism. ere are many dual phenomenons in reallife which inspire several dual structures in model design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposes a dual-model paradigm to merge the training of two dual tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> extends GCN to dual structures, combining global and local consistencies in graph. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposes DELF conducting dual embedding for users and items in recommender systems. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, our model possesses several key di erences: i) for the item-based user embedding (resp. the user-based item embedding), DANSER considers dynamic embedding under speci c candidate items (resp. targeted users), while DELF treats embedding statically given a user (resp. item); ii) in dual GCN/GAT layer, DANSER harnesses two dual GATs to capture social information in user social network and item implicit network, while DELF considers no user-to-user and item-to-item mutual in uences; iii) in the policybased fusion layer, DANSER dynamically weighs the importances of the four GAT representations, while DELF straightforwardly concatenates four embedding vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed DANSER, which includes two dual graph a ention networks, to learn deep representations for social e ects in recommender systems. Our method is equipped with good expressiveness because: i) it can collaboratively model homophily and in uence e ects from both friend users and related items; ii) it can investigate heterogeneous importance distributions among di erent interactions of the two two-fold social e ects for distinct user-item pairs. Our comparative experiments and ablation studies on a benchmark dataset and a commercial dataset showed that DANSER can learn e ective representations of multifaceted social e ects and leverage this information to signi cantly improve recommendation accuracy.</p><p>As extension of our work, we believe that the construction of item implicit network could leverage extra a ribute features or distill more high-level connections through knowledge graphs if the information is available. More generally, one could extend DANSER to other information retrieval tasks, like question answering, where DANSER could model 'social e ects' from related questions and similar answers given the corresponding networks of them.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>is work was supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China [2018YFB1004703]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872238, 61672353]; the Shanghai Science and Technology Fund [17510740200]; the Huawei Innovation Research Program [HO2018085286]; and the State Key Laboratory of Air Tra c Management System and Technology [SKLATM20180X]; the Tencent Social Ads Rhino-Bird Focused Research Program.</figDesc></figure>
