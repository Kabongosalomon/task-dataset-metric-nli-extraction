				<p>Information selection is the most important component in document summarization task. In this paper, we propose to extend the basic neural encoding-decoding framework with an information selection layer to explicitly model and optimize the information selection process in abstractive document summarization. Specifically, our information selection layer consists of two parts: gated global information filtering and local sentence selection. Unnecessary information in the original document is first globally filtered, then salient sentences are selected locally while generating each summary sentence sequentially. To optimize the information selection process directly , distantly-supervised training guided by the golden summary is also imported. Experimental results demonstrate that the explicit modeling and optimizing of the information selection process improves document summa-rization performance significantly, which enables our model to generate more informative and concise summaries, and thus significantly outperform state-of-the-art neural abstractive methods.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Document summarization is the task of generating a fluent and condensed summary for a document while retaining the gist information. There are two prominent approaches: extractive methods and abstractive methods. Extractive methods generate summary for a document by directly selecting salient sentences from the original document. On the contrary, abstractive methods synthesize information from the input document to generate summary using arbitrary words and expressionsas human usually do. Recent neural models enable an end-to-end framework for natural language * This work was done while the first author was doing internship at Baidu Inc. generation, which inspires the research on abstractive document summarization.</p><p>Most existing work directly apply the neural encoding-decoding framework, which first encodes the input into an abstract representation and then decodes the output based on the encoded information. Although the encodingdecoding framework has achieved huge success on some text generation tasks like machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2014</ref>) and image caption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Vinyals et al., 2015)</ref>, the performance on abstractive document summarization is much less convincing. Since document summarization is a special natural language generation task that requires information selection, the performance of current neural abstractive methods even has a considerable gap from extractive methods.</p><p>The most essential prerequisite for a practical document summarization system is that the generated summary must contain the salient information of the original document. Since a document is a long sequence of multiple sentences, both global document information and local inter-sentence relations need to be properly modeled in the information selection process. Although the encodingdecoding framework has implicitly modeled the information selection process via end-to-end training, we argue that abstractive document summarization shall benefit from explicitly modeling and optimizing it by capturing both the global document information and local inter-sentence relations.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to extend the encoding-decoding framework to model the information selection process explicitly. We treat the document summarization as a three-phase task: document encoding, information selection and summary decoding. Correspondingly, our model consists of three layers: a document encoder layer, an information selection layer and a </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h 1,1 ' h 2,1 ' h 3,1 ' h 1,2 ' h 2,2 ' h 3,2 ' h 1,3 ' h 2,3 ' h 3,3 '</formula><p>Figure 1: Our abstractive document summarization model, which mainly consists of three layers: document encoder layer (the top part), information selection layer (the middle part) and summary decoder layer (the bottom part).</p><p>summary decoder layer, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In our model, both the document and summary are processed sentence by sentence, to better capture the inter-sentence relations. The information selection layer consists of two parts: gated global information filtering and local sentence selection. Unnecessary information in the original document are first globally filtered by a gated network, then important sentences are selected locally while generating each summary sentence sequentially. Moreover, we propose to optimize the information selection process with distantlysupervised training. Our proposed method combines the strengths of extractive methods and abstractive methods, which is able to tackle the factors of saliency, non-redundancy, coherence and fluency under a unified framework. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that the explicit modeling and distantly-supervised optimizing of the information selection process improves document summarization performance significantly, which enables our model to significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural abstractive methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Model</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, our model consists of a hierarchical document encoder, an information selection layer and an attention-equipped decoder. Firstly, the hierarchical encoder encodes the document sentence by sentence, and word by word in each sentence. Then the information selection layer selects and filters the sentence representations based on the global document representation. A sentence selection RNN is used to select salient and relevant sentences while generating each summary sentence sequentially based on the tailored sentence representations. At last, the summary decoder produces the output summary to paraphrase and generalize the selected sentences.</p><p>In the following, we denote h i , h i,j as the hidden state of the i-th sentence and the j-th word of the i-th sentence in the document encoder part, respectively. In the information selection and summary decoder part, we denote h ′ t , h ′ t,k as the hidden state of the t-th summary sentence and the k-th word in the t-th summary sentence, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Document Encoder</head><p>A document d is a sequence of sentences d = {s i }, and each sentence is a sequence of words s i = {w i,j }. A hierarchical encoder, which consists of two levels: word level and sentence level similar to ( , is used to encode the document from both word and sentence level.</p><p>The word-level encoder is a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chung et al., 2014</ref>), which encodes the words of a sentence into sentence representation. The word encoder sequentially updates its hidden state after receiving a word, which is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h i,j = BiGRU (h i,j−1 , e i,j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where h i,j and e i,j denotes the hidden state and embedding of word w i,j , respectively. The concatenation of the forward and backward final hidden states in the word-level encoder is indicated as the vector representation x i of the sentence s i , which is used as input to the sentencelevel encoder. The sentence encoder is also a bidirectional GRU, which updates its hidden state after receiving each sentence representation by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h i = BiGRU (h i−1 , x i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where h i denotes the hidden state of sentence s i . The concatenation of the forward and backward final states in the sentence-level encoder is used as the vector representation of documentˆddocumentˆ documentˆd.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Information Selection</head><p>Document summarization is a special natural language generation task which requires information compression. It needs to remove the unnecessary information and select salient information from the input document to produce a condensed summary. However, it is difficult for the basic encoderdecoder framework to learn the process of salient information selection, which has also been noticed by several previous work <ref type="bibr">(Tan et al., 2017a,b)</ref>. To tackle the challenge, we extend the basic encoderdecoder framework by adding an information selection layer to model the information selection process explicitly. Our information selection layer consists of two parts: gated global information filtering that used to remove the unnecessary information of a document, and local sentence selection that used to select salient sentences from a document sequentially to produce summary sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gated Global Information Filtering</head><p>Inspired by studies on how human write text summaries by first skimming the document and deleting unnecessary material <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown and Day, 1983)</ref>, we design a gated global information filtering network to filter unnecessary information of a document based on the global document representation before the summary decoder generates summary. Concretely, the gated information filtering network makes use of the document representationˆdtionˆ tionˆd, which represents the global information of a document, to filter sentences based on the sentence representation h i .</p><p>For each source sentence s i , the gate network takes the document representationˆdrepresentationˆ representationˆd and sentence representation h i as inputs to compute the gate vector g i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g i = σ(W g h i + U g ˆ d + b g )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where W g and U g denote weight matrices, b g the bias vector, and σ the sigmoid activation function. Then each sentence s i can be filtered by the gate vector g i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f i = h i ⊙ g i (4)</formula><p>where f i indicates the representation of sentence s i after information filtering, and ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. Note that, we filter sentences in micro semantic dimensions rather than filtering whole sentences. The tailored sentence representations are used as input to the sentence selection network and summary decoder, which can help to detect salient sentences and improve informativeness of the generated summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local Sentence Selection</head><p>We explicitly model the local sentence selection process which selects several target sentences to generate a summary sentence. Concretely, we apply a RNN layer to sequentially select target sentences for each summary sentence, shown as in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The sentence-selection RNN uses the document representationˆdrepresentationˆ representationˆd as initial state h ′ 0 , and sequentially predicts the sentence selection vector α t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">α i t = e ϕ(f i ,h ′ t ) ∑ l e ϕ(f l ,h ′ t ) (5) ϕ(f i , h ′ t ) = v T tanh(W f f i + W h h ′ t + b). (6)</formula><p>where α i t indicates the weight of source sentence s i when generating the t-th summary sentence, and h ′ t denotes the hidden state of sentence selection layer when generating the t-th summary sentence. v, W f and W h are weight matrices, and b is the bias vector. Note that, the sentence selection vector α t is computed based on the tailored sentence representation f i .</p><p>The sentence-selection RNN uses a single unidirectional GRU, which updates its state by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h ′ t = GRU (h ′ t−1 , x ′ t )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where x ′ t denotes the input of current sentenceselection step. x ′ t combines both the previous sentence selection vector α t−1 and the encoded representation of previous generated sentence r</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">′ t−1 by x ′ t = tanh(W r r ′ t−1 + W α α t−1 + b x ),</formula><p>where W r , W α , and b x denote learnable parameters.</p><p>The representation of the selected source sentences is computed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q t = ∑ j α j t f j (8)</formula><p>which is used as initial state of the summary decoder to generate a summary sentence to paraphrase and generalize the selected sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Summary Decoder</head><p>On top of the document encoder and the information selection layer, we use GRU with attention as the summary decoder to realize each summary sentence word by word. At each word decoding step k in the t-th summary sentence, the GRU reads the previous word embedding e t,k−1 and context vector c t,k−1 as inputs to compute the new hidden state h ′ t,k by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">h ′ t,k = GRU (h ′ t,k−1 , c t,k−1 , e t,k−1 )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>We import attention mechanism to help locate relevant words to be copied or paraphrased within the selected source sentences in each word generation step. The attention distribution β i t,k of the kth word of the tth summary sentence over the sentences in the ith document can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">β i,j t,k = α i t e ϕ(h i,j ,h ′ t,k ) ∑ l e ϕ(h i,l ,h ′ t,k )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where α i t denotes the weight of the ith source sentence, used to normalize the word attention distributions. Then the word-level context vector when generating the kth word at the tth sentence generation step can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c t,k = ∑ i ∑ j β i,j t,k h i,j</formula><p>, which is also incorporated into the word decoder.</p><p>At each word generation step, the vocabulary distribution is calculated from the context vector c t,k and the decoder state h ′ t,k by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P vocab (w ′ t,k ) = sof tmax(Wv(Wc[h ′ t,k , c t,k ] + bc) + bv)<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where W v and W c are learned parameters. The copy mechanism based on the word attention is also imported into the decoder to alleviate the OOV problems as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">See et al., 2017</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Model Learning with Distant Supervision</head><p>Despite the end-to-end training for the performance of generated summary, we also directly optimize the sentence selection decisions by importing supervision for the sentence selection vector α t in Equation 5. While there is no explicit supervision for sentence selection, we define a simple approach for labeling sentences based on the reference summaries. To simulate the sentence selection process on human-written abstracts, we compute the words-matching similarities (based on TF-IDF cosine similarity) between a reference-summary sentence and corresponding source document sentences and normalize them into distantly-labelled sentence selection vector p t . Then the sentence selection loss is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">loss sel = ∑ t D KL (α t , p t )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where D KL (α t , p t ) indicates the KL-divergence between distribution α t and p t . The sentence selection loss is imported into the final loss function to be optimized with the summary generation component together. The loss function L of the model is the mix of the negative log-likelihood of generating summaries over training set T , and the sentence selection loss of distantly-supervised training:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L = ∑ (X,Y )∈T −logP (Y |X; θ) + λloss sel (13)</formula><p>where λ is a hyper-parameter tuned on the validation set. (X, Y ) denotes a document-summary pair in the training set.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Parameters</head><p>For all experiments, the word-level encoder and summary decoder both use 256-dimensional hidden states, and the sentence-level encoder and sentence selection network both use 512-dimensional hidden states. We use pre-trained Glove ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> vector for initialization of word embeddings. The dimension of word embeddings is 100, which will be further trained in the model. We use a vocabulary of 50k words for both encoder and decoder.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Baselines</head><p>We compare our system with the results of stateof-the-art neural summarization approaches reported in recent papers, which contain both abstractive models and extractive models. The extractive models include SummaRuNNer (Nallapati et al., 2017), while SummaRuNNer-abs is similar to SummaRuNNer but is trained directly on the abstractive summaries. Lead-3 is a strong extractive baseline which uses the first 3 sentences of the document as summary. The abstractive models include:</p><p>1) Seq2seq-baseline, which uses the basic seq2seq encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanism and incorporates with the copy mechanism as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">See et al., 2017</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">See et al., 2017)</ref>, which is an extension of the Seq2seq-baseline model by importing coverage mechanism to control repetitions in summary.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROUGE Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate our models with the standard ROUGE metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lin, 2004</ref>) and obtain ROUGE scores using the pyrouge package. Results in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 1</ref> show that our method has significant improvement over state-of-the-art neural abstractive baselines as well as extractive baselines. Note that, the Deep-reinforced model achieves the best ROUGE-L performance because it directly optimizes the ROUGE-L metric. Comparing with the current state-of-the-art model Coverage, our model achieves significant better performance on ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 metrics, and comparable performance on ROUGE-L metric, which demonstrates that our model is more effective in selecting salient information from a document to produce an informative summary while keeping the ability to generate fluent and correct sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human Evaluation with Case Analysis</head><p>In addition to the ROUGE evaluation, we also conducted human evaluation on 50 random samples from CNN/DailyMail test set and compared the summaries generated by our method with the outputs of Lead-3, Seq2seq-baseline and Coverage. Three data annotators were asked to compare the generated summaries with the human summaries, and assess each summary from four independent Gold Reference: faith and hope howie were born with one body and two faces on may 8 . they tragically died in hospital just 19 days after they were born . parents simon howie and renee young visit their grave at pinegrove in western sydney fortnightly . they arrived on thursday to find the grave bare of all the girls ' mementos . staff had cleared entire baby section and thrown belongings in rubbish .

(2) Concise: How concise the summary is? (3) Coherent: How coherent (between sentences) the summary is? (4) Fluent: How fluent, grammatical the sentences of a summary are? Each property is assessed with a score from 1(worst) to 5(best) by three annotators. The average results are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>The results show that our model consistently outperforms the Seq2seq-baseline model and the previous state-of-the-art method Coverage. An example of comparison of the generated summaries by our model with the two abstractive models (w.r.t the reference summary) is shown in Table 3 1 . The summary generated by Seq2Seq-Baseline usually contains repetition of sentences, which seriously affects its informativeness, conciseness as well as coherence. For example, the sentence "faith and hope howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born ..." is repeated three times in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. The Coverage model effectively alleviates the information repetition problem, however, it loses some salient information that should be included in the summary. For example, the information about "mementos" and "family members visit the grave" is lost in the example shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. The summary generated by our method obviously contains more <ref type="bibr">1</ref> More examples are shown in the supplementary material (a) Gold Reference  and Oi indicate the i-th sentence of the input and output, respectively. Obviously, our model can detect more salient sentences that are included in the reference summary. salient information, which shows the effectiveness of the information selection component in our model. According to the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table  2</ref>, the sentence-level modeling of document and summary in our model also makes the generated summaries achieve better inter-sentence coherence. Compared with the strong extractive baseline Lead-3, our model is able to generate more informative and concise summaries, which shows the advantage of abstractive methods. The fluency scores also show the good ability of our model to generate fluent and grammatical sentences. The human evaluation results demonstrate that our model is able to generate more informative, concise and coherent summaries than the baselines.</p><note type="other">I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 I 5 I 6 I 7 I 8 I 9 I 10 I 11 I 12 I 13 I 14 I 15 I 16 I 17 I 18 I 19 I 20 O</note><formula xml:id="formula_15">1 O 2 O 3 O 4 O 5 (d) Our Model O 1 O 2 O 3 I 1 I 2 I 3</formula><p>The visualization of the sentence selection vectors of the gold reference summary and the three abstractive models when generating the presented examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> 2 . The figure shows that Seq2Seq-baseline fails to detect all important source sentences and attend to the same sentences repeatedly, which result in generating repeated summary sentences. Coverage learns to reduce repetitions, but fails to detect all the salient information. Obviously, our method is more effective in selecting salient and relevant source sentences from the document to generate more informative summary. Furthermore, our  method tends to focus on different sets of source sentences when generating different summary sentences.

The results show that both the gated global information filtering and distant supervision training are effective for improving information selection in document summarization. Our proposed method effectively combines the strengths of extractive methods and abstractive methods into a unified framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Effects of Summary Length</head><p>We further compare our method with the Coverage model by evaluating them on the test set with different length of golden reference summaries. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref>, which demonstrate that our method is better at generating long summary for long document. As the golden summary becoming longer, our system will obtain larger advantages over the baseline (from +1.0 Rouge-1, +0.1 Rouge-2 and -0.63 Rouge-L for summary less than 75 words, rising to +10.68 Rouge-1, +6.05 Rouge-2 and +4.86 Rouge-L for summaries more than 125 words). The results also verify that our method is more effective in selecting salient information from documents, especially for long documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Existing exploration on document summarization mainly can be categorized to extractive methods and abstractive methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Extractive Summarization Methods</head><p>Neural networks have been widely investigated on extractive document summarization task. Earlier work attempts to use deep learning techniques to improve sentence ranking or scoring <ref type="bibr">(Cao et al., 2015a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yin and Pei, 2015)</ref>. Some recent work solves the sentence extraction and document modeling in an end-to-end framework. <ref type="bibr">Cheng and La- pata (2016)</ref> propose an encoder-decoder approach where the encoder hierarchically learns the representation of sentences and documents while an attention-based sentence extractor extracts salient sentences sequentially from the original document. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> propose a recurrent neural network-based sequence-to-sequence model for sequential labelling of each sentence in the document. Neural models are able to leverage large-scale corpora and achieve better performance than traditional methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Abstractive Summarization Methods</head><p>As the seq2seq learning with neural networks achieve huge success in sequence generation tasks like machine translation, it also shows great potential in text summarization area, especially for abstractive methods. Some earlier researches studied the use of seq2seq learning for abstractive sentence summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Takase et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chopra et al., 2016</ref>). These models are trained on a large corpus of news documents which are usually shortened to be the first one or two sentences, and their headlines.</p><p>Later, some work explored the seq2seq models on document summarization, which produce a multi-sentence summary for a document. The seq2seq models usually exhibit some undesirable behaviors, such as inaccurately reproducing factual details, unable to deal with out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words and repetitions. To alleviate these issues, copying mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gu et al., 2016;</ref>) has been incorporated into the encoderdecoder architecture. Distraction-based attention model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2016)</ref> and coverage mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">See et al., 2017</ref>) have also been investigated to alleviate the repetition problem. To better train the seq2seq model on tasks with long documents and multi-sentence summaries, a deep reinforced model was proposed to combine the standard words predication with teacher forcing learning and the global sequence prediction training with reinforcement learning ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Paulus et al., 2017)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tan et al. (2017a)</ref> propose to leverage the hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture on generating multi-sentence summaries, and incorporate sentence-ranking into the summary generation process based on the graph-based attention mechanism. Different from these neural-based work, our model explicitly models the information selection process in document summarization by extending the encoder-decoder framework with an information selection layer. Our model captures both the global document information and local inter-sentence relations, and optimize the information selection process directly via distantlysupervised training, which effectively combines the strengths of extractive methods and abstractive methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have analyzed the necessity of explicitly modeling and optimizing of the information selection process in document summarization, and verified its effectiveness by extending the basic neural encoding-decoding framework with an information selection layer and optimizing it with distantly-supervised training. Our information selection layer consists of a gated global information filtering network and a local RNN sentence selection network. Experimental results demonstrate that both of them are effective for helping select salient information during the summary generation process, which significantly improves the document summarization performance. Our model combines the strengths of extractive methods and abstractive methods, which can generate more informative and concise summaries, and thus achieves state-of-the-art abstractive document summarization performance and is also competitive with state-of-the-art extractive models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Visualization of sentence selection vectors.
