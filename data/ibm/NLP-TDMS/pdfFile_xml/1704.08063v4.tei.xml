<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in face recognition (FR). Owing to advanced network architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> and discriminative learning approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, deep CNNs have boosted the FR performance to an unprecedent level. Typically, face recognition can be categorized as face identification and face verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The former classifies a face to a specific identity, while the latter determines whether a pair of faces belongs to the same identity.</p><p>In terms of testing protocol, face recognition can be evaluated under closed-set or open-set settings, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. For closed-set protocol, all testing identities are predefined in training set. It is natural to classify testing face images to the given identities. In this scenario, face verification is equivalent to performing identification for a pair of faces respectively (see left side of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Therefore, closedset FR can be well addressed as a classification problem,   <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Comparison among softmax loss, modified softmax loss and A-Softmax loss. In this toy experiment, we construct a CNN to learn 2-D features on a subset of the CASIA face dataset. In specific, we set the output dimension of FC1 layer as 2 and visualize the learned features. Yellow dots represent the first class face features, while purple dots represent the second class face features. One can see that features learned by the original softmax loss can not be classified simply via angles, while modified softmax loss can. Our A-Softmax loss can further increase the angular margin of learned features.</p><p>oneering work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> learn face features via the softmax loss 2 , but softmax loss only learns separable features that are not discriminative enough. To address this, some methods combine softmax loss with contrastive loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> or center loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to enhance the discrimination power of features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> adopts triplet loss to supervise the embedding learning, leading to state-of-the-art face recognition results. However, center loss only explicitly encourages intra-class compactness. Both contrastive loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and triplet loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> can not constrain on each individual sample, and thus require carefully designed pair/triplet mining procedure, which is both time-consuming and performance-sensitive. It seems to be a widely recognized choice to impose Euclidean margin to learned features, but a question arises: Is Euclidean margin always suitable for learning discriminative face features? To answer this question, we first look into how Euclidean margin based losses are applied to FR.</p><p>Most recent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> combine Euclidean margin based losses with softmax loss to construct a joint supervision. However, as can be observed from <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the features learned by softmax loss have intrinsic angular distribution (also verified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>). In some sense, Euclidean margin based losses are incompatible with softmax loss, so it is not well motivated to combine these two type of losses.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to incorporate angular margin instead. We start with a binary-class case to analyze the softmax loss. The decision boundary in softmax loss is (W 1 − W 2 )x + b 1 − b 2 = 0, where W i and b i are weights and bias 3 in softmax loss, respectively. If we define x as a feature vector and constrain W 1 = W 2 = 1 and b 1 = b 2 = 0, the decision boundary becomes x (cos(θ 1 ) − cos(θ 2 )) = 0, where θ i is the angle between W i and x. The new decision boundary only depends on θ 1 and θ 2 . Modified softmax loss is able to directly optimize angles, enabling CNNs to learn angularly distributed features ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>Compared to original softmax loss, the features learned by modified softmax loss are angularly distributed, but not necessarily more discriminative. To the end, we generalize the modified softmax loss to angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss. Specifically, we introduce an integer m (m ≥ 1) to quantitatively control the decision boundary. In binaryclass case, the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 become x (cos(mθ 1 )−cos(θ 2 ))=0 and x (cos(θ 1 )− cos(mθ 2 ))=0, respectively. m quantitatively controls the size of angular margin. Furthermore, A-Softmax loss can be easily generalized to multiple classes, similar to softmax loss. By optimizing A-Softmax loss, the decision regions become more separated, simultaneously enlarging the inter-class margin and compressing the intra-class angular distribution.</p><p>A-Softmax loss has clear geometric interpretation. Supervised by A-Softmax loss, the learned features construct a discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to geodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold. A-Softmax loss can be interpreted as constraining learned features to be discriminative on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that face images lie on a manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The close connection between A-Softmax loss and hypersphere manifolds makes the learned features more effective for face recognition. For this reason, we term the learned features as SphereFace.</p><p>Moreover, A-Softmax loss can quantitatively adjust the angular margin via a parameter m, enabling us to do quantitative analysis. In the light of this, we derive lower bounds for the parameter m to approximate the desired open-set FR criterion that the maximal intra-class distance should be smaller than the minimal inter-class distance.</p><p>Our major contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) We propose A-Softmax loss for CNNs to learn discriminative face features with clear and novel geometric interpretation. The learned features discriminatively span on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold.</p><p>(2) We derive lower bounds for m such that A-Softmax loss can approximate the learning task that minimal interclass distance is larger than maximal intra-class distance.</p><p>(3) We are the very first to show the effectiveness of angular margin in FR. Trained on publicly available CASIA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, SphereFace achieves competitive results on several benchmarks, including Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Revisiting the Softmax Loss</head><p>We revisit the softmax loss by looking into the decision criteria of softmax loss. In binary-class case, the posterior probabilities obtained by softmax loss are</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p 1 = exp(W T 1 x + b 1 ) exp(W T 1 x + b 1 ) + exp(W T 2 x + b 2 )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">p 2 = exp(W T 2 x + b 2 ) exp(W T 1 x + b 1 ) + exp(W T 2 x + b 2 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x is the learned feature vector.

By comparing p 1 and p 2 , it is clear that W T 1 x + b 1 and W T 2 x + b 2 determine the classification result. The decision boundary is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(W 1 − W 2 )x + b 1 − b 2 = 0. We then rewrite W T i x + b i as W T i x cos(θ i ) + b i where θ i is the angle between W i and x.</formula><p>Notice that if we normalize the weights and zero the biases ( W i = 1, b i =0), the posterior probabilities become p 1 = x cos(θ 1 ) and p 2 = x cos(θ 2 ). Note that p 1 and p 2 share the same x, the final result only depends on the angles θ 1 and θ 2 . The decision boundary also becomes cos(θ 1 )−cos(θ 2 )=0 (i.e. angular bisector of vector W 1 and W 2 ). Although the above analysis is built on binary-calss case, it is trivial to generalize the analysis to multi-class case. During training, the modified softmax loss ( W i =1, b i =0) encourages features from the i-th class to have smaller angle θ i (larger cosine distance) than others, which makes angles between W i and features a reliable metric for classification.</p><p>To give a formal expression for the modified softmax loss, we first define the input feature x i and its label y i . The original softmax loss can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L = 1 N i L i = 1 N i − log e fy i j e f j<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where f j denotes the j-th element (j ∈ [1, K], K is the class number) of the class score vector f , and N is the number of training samples. In CNNs, f is usually the output of a fully connected layer W , so f j = W T j x i + b j and f yi = W T yi x i + b yi where x i , W j , W yi are the i-th training sample, the j-th and y i -th column of W respectively. We further reformulate L i in Eq. (3) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L i = − log e W T y i x i +by i j e W T j x i +b j = − log e Wy i x i cos(θ y i ,i )+by i j e W j x i cos(θ j,i )+b j<label>(4)</label></formula><p>in which θ j,i (0 ≤ θ j,i ≤ π) is the angle between vector W j and x i . As analyzed above, we first normalize W j = 1, ∀j in each iteration and zero the biases. Then we have the modified softmax loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L modified = 1 N i − log e x i cos(θ y i ,i ) j e x i cos(θ j,i )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Although we can learn features with angular boundary with the modified softmax loss, these features are still not necessarily discriminative. Since we use angles as the distance metric, it is natural to incorporate angular margin to learned features in order to enhance the discrimination power. To this end, we propose a novel way to combine angular margin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Boundary Softmax Loss</head><formula xml:id="formula_7">(W 1 − W 2 )x + b 1 − b 2 = 0 Modified Softmax Loss x (cos θ 1 − cos θ 2 ) = 0</formula><p>A-Softmax Loss x (cos mθ 1 − cos θ 2 ) = 0 for class 1 x (cos θ 1 − cos mθ 2 ) = 0 for class 2 to contrastive loss) , we propose a more natural way to learn angular margin. From the previous analysis of softmax loss, we learn that decision boundaries can greatly affect the feature distribution, so our basic idea is to manipulate decision boundaries to produce angular margin. We first give a motivating binary-class example to explain how our idea works. Assume a learned feature x from class 1 is given and θ i is the angle between x and W i , it is known that the modified softmax loss requires cos(θ 1 ) &gt; cos(θ 2 ) to correctly classify x. But what if we instead require cos(mθ 1 ) &gt; cos(θ 2 ) where m ≥ 2 is a integer in order to correctly classify x? It is essentially making the decision more stringent than previous, because we require a lower bound 4 of cos(θ 1 ) to be larger than cos(θ 2 ). The decision boundary for class 1 is cos(mθ 1 ) = cos(θ 2 ). Similarly, if we require cos(mθ 2 ) &gt; cos(θ 1 ) to correctly classify features from class 2, the decision boundary for class 2 is cos(mθ 2 ) = cos(θ 1 ). Suppose all training samples are correctly classified, such decision boundaries will produce an angular margin of m−1 m+1 θ 1 2 where θ 1 2 is the angle between W 1 and W 2 . From angular perspective, correctly classifying x from identity 1 requires θ 1 &lt; θ2 m , while correctly classifying x from identity 2 requires θ 2 &lt; θ1 m . Both are more difficult than original θ 1 &lt; θ 2 and θ 2 &lt; θ 1 , respectively. By directly formulating this idea into the modified softmax loss Eq. (5), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Lang = 1 N i − log e x i cos(mθ y i ,i ) e x i cos(mθ y i ,i ) + j =y i e x i cos(θ j,i )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where θ yi,i has to be in the range of [0, π m ]. In order to get rid of this restriction and make it optimizable in CNNs, we expand the definition range of cos(θ yi,i ) by generalizing it to a monotonically decreasing angle function ψ(θ yi,i ) which should be equal to cos(θ yi,i ) in [0, π m ]. Therefore, our proposed A-Softmax loss is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Lang = 1 N i − log e x i ψ(θ y i ,i ) e x i ψ(θ y i ,i ) + j =y i e x i cos(θ j,i )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>in which we define ψ(θ yi,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">i ) = (−1) k cos(mθ yi,i ) − 2k, θ yi,i ∈ [ kπ m , (k+1)π m ] and k ∈ [0, m − 1]. m ≥ 1</formula><p>is an integer that controls the size of angular margin. When m = 1, it becomes the modified softmax loss.</p><p>The justification of A-Softmax loss can also be made from decision boundary perspective. A-Softmax loss adopts different decision boundary for different class (each boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The inequality cos(θ 1 ) &gt; cos(mθ 1 ) holds while <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Geometry Interpretation of Euclidean margin loss (e.g. contrastive loss, triplet loss, center loss, etc.), modified softmax loss and A-Softmax loss.

The comparison of decision boundaries is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. From original softmax loss to modified softmax loss, it is from optimizing inner product to optimizing angles. From modified softmax loss to A-Softmax loss, it makes the decision boundary more stringent and separated. The angular margin increases with larger m and be zero if m = 1.</p><p>Supervised by A-Softmax loss, CNNs learn face features with geometrically interpretable angular margin. Because A-Softmax loss requires W i = 1, b i = 0, it makes the prediction only depends on angles between the sample x and W i . So x can be classified to the identity with smallest angle. The parameter m is added for the purpose of learning an angular margin between different identities.</p><p>To facilitate gradient computation and back propagation, we replace cos(θ j,i ) and cos(mθ yi,i ) with the expressions only containing W and x i , which is easily done by definition of cosine and multi-angle formula (also the reason why we need m to be an integer). Without θ, we can compute derivative with respect to x and W , similar to softmax loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Hypersphere Interpretation of A-Softmax Loss</head><p>A-Softmax loss has stronger requirements for a correct classification when m ≥ 2, which generates an angular classification margin between learned features of different classes. A-Softmax loss not only imposes discriminative power to the learned features via angular margin, but also renders nice and novel hypersphere interpretation. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, A-Softmax loss is equivalent to learning features that are discriminative on a hypersphere manifold, while Euclidean margin losses learn features in Euclidean space.</p><p>To simplify, We take the binary case to analyze the hypersphere interpretation. Considering a sample x from class 1 and two column weights W 1 , W 2 , the classification rule for A-Softmax loss is cos(mθ 1 ) &gt; cos(θ 2 ), equivalently mθ 1 &lt; θ 2 . Notice that θ 1 , θ 2 are equal to their corresponding arc length ω 1 , ω 2 5 on unit hypersphere {v j , ∀j| j v 2 j =1, v≥0}. Because W 1 = W 2 = 1, the decision replies on the arc length ω 1 and ω 2 . The decision boundary is equivalent to mω 1 = ω 2 , and the constrained region for correctly classifying x to class 1 is mω 1 &lt; ω 2 . Geometrically speaking, this is a hypercircle-like region lying on a hypersphere manifold. For example, it is a circle-like region on the unit sphere in 3D case, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Note that larger m leads to smaller hypercircle-like region for each class, which is an explicit discriminative constraint on a manifold. For better understanding, <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> provides 2D and 3D visualizations. One can see that A-Softmax loss imposes arc length constraint on a unit circle in 2D case and circle-like region constraint on a unit sphere in 3D case. Our analysis shows that optimizing angles with A-Softmax loss essentially makes the learned features more discriminative on a hypersphere.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Discussions</head><p>Why angular margin. First and most importantly, angular margin directly links to discriminativeness on a manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Second, incorporating angular margin to softmax loss is actually a more natural choice. As <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows, features learned by the original softmax loss have an intrinsic angular distribution. So directly combining Euclidean margin constraints with softmax loss is not reasonable.</p><p>Comparison with existing losses. In deep FR task, the most popular and well-performing loss functions include contrastive loss, triplet loss and center loss. First, they only impose Euclidean margin to the learned features (w/o normalization), while ours instead directly considers angular margin which is naturally motivated. Second, both contrastive loss and triplet loss suffer from data expansion when constituting the pairs/triplets from the training set, while ours requires no sample mining and imposes discriminative constraints to the entire mini-batches (compared to contrastive and triplet loss that only affect a few representative pairs/triplets).</p></div>

The general framework to train and extract SphereFace features is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. We use residual units <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in our CNN architecture. For fairness, all compared methods use the same CNN architecture (including residual units) as SphereFace. CNNs with different depths (4, 10, 20, 36, 64) are used to better evaluate our method. The specific settings for difffernt CNNs we used are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. According to the analysis in Section 3.4, we usually set m as 4 in A-Softmax loss unless specified. These models are trained with batch size of 128 on four GPUs. The learning rate begins with 0.1 and is divided by 10 at the 16K, 24K iterations. The training is finished at 28K iterations.  Training Data. We use publicly available web-collected training dataset CASIA-WebFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (after excluding the images of identities appearing in testing sets) to train our CNN models. CASIA-WebFace has 494,414 face images belonging to 10,575 different individuals. These face images are horizontally flipped for data augmentation. Notice that the scale of our training data (0.49M) is relatively small, especially compared to other private datasets used in DeepFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> (4M), VGGFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (2M) and FaceNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (200M).</p></div>

To show that larger m leads to larger angular margin (i.e. more discriminative feature distribution on manifold), we perform a toy example with different m. We train A-Softmax loss with 6 individuals that have the most samples in CASIA-WebFace. We set the output feature dimension (FC1) as 3 and visualize the training samples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>. One can observe that larger m leads to more discriminative distribution on the sphere and also larger angular margin, as expected. We also use class 1 (blue) and class 2 (dark green) to construct positive and negative pairs to evaluate the angle distribution of features from the same class and different classes. The angle distribution of positive and negative pairs (the second row of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>) quantitatively shows the angular margin becomes larger while m increases and every class also becomes more distinct with each other.</p><p>Besides visual comparison, we also perform face recognition on LFW and YTF to evaluate the effect of m.

Both datasets contains faces with large variations in pose, expression and illuminations. We follow the unrestricted with labeled outside data protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> on both datasets. The performance of SphereFace are evaluated on 6,000 face pairs from LFW and 5,000 video pairs from YTF. The results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.

Most of the existing face verification systems achieve high performance with huge training data or model ensemble. While using single model trained on publicly available dataset (CAISA-WebFace, relatively small and having noisy labels), SphereFace achieves 99.42% and 95.0% accuracies on LFW and YTF datasets. It is the current best performance trained on WebFace and considerably better than the other models trained on the same dataset. Compared with models trained on high-quality private datasets, SphereFace is still very competitive, outperforming most of the existing results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Experiments on MegaFace Challenge</head><p>MegaFace dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is a recently released testing benchmark with very challenging task to evaluate the performance of face recognition methods at the million scale of distractors. MegaFace dataset contains a gallery set and a probe set. The gallery set contains more than 1 million images from 690K different individuals. The probe set consists of two existing datasets: Facescrub <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and FGNet. MegaFace has several testing scenarios including identification, verification and pose invariance under two protocols (large or small training set). The training set is viewed as small if it is less than 0.5M. We evaluate SphereFace under the small training set protocol. We adopt two testing protocols: face identification and verification. The results are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref> and Tabel 5. Note that we use simple 3-patch feature concatenation ensemble as the final performance of SphereFace. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref> and Tabel 5 show that SphereFace (3 patches ensemble) beats the second best result by a large margins (4.8% for rank-1 identification rate and 6.3% for verification rate) on MegaFace benchmark under the small training dataset protocol. Compared to the models trained on large dataset (500 million for Google and 18 million for NTechLAB), our method still performs better (0.64% for id. rate and 1.4% for veri. rate). Moreover, in contrast to their sophisticated network design, we only employ typical CNN architecture supervised by A-Softamx to achieve such excellent performance. For single model SphereFace, the accuracy of face identification and verification are still 72.73% and 85.56% respectively, which already outperforms most state-of-theart methods. For better evaluation, we also implement the softmax loss, contrastive loss, center loss, triplet loss and L-Softmax loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Compared to these loss functions trained with the same CNN architecture and dataset, SphereFace also shows significant and consistent improvements. These results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed SphereFace is well designed for open-set face recognition. One can also see that learning features with large inter-class angular margin can significantly improve the open-set FR performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>This paper presents a novel deep hypersphere embedding approach for face recognition. In specific, we propose the angular softmax loss for CNNs to learn discriminative face features (SphereFace) with angular margin. A-Softmax loss renders nice geometric interpretation by constraining learned features to be discriminative on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a non-linear manifold. This connection makes A-Softmax very effective for learning face representation. Competitive results on several popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and great potentials of our approach. We also believe A-Softmax loss could also benefit some other tasks like object recognition, person re-identification, etc.</p><p>Standard CNNs usually connect ReLU to the bottom of FC1, so the learned features will only distribute in the non-negative range [0, +∞), which limits the feasible learning space (angle) for the CNNs. To address this shortcoming, both SphereFace and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> first propose to remove the ReLU nonlinearity that is connected to the bottom of FC1 in SphereFace networks. Intuitively, removing the ReLU can greatly benefit the feature learning, since it provides larger feasible learning space (from angular perspective).</p><p>Visualization on MNIST. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> shows the 2-D visualization of feature distributions in MNIST with and without the last ReLU. One can observe with ReLU the 2-D feature could only distribute in the first quadrant. Without the last ReLU, the learned feature distribution is much more reasonable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Normalizing the weights could reduce the prior caused by the training data imbalance</head><p>We have emphasized in the main paper that normalizing the weights can give better geometric interpretation. Besides this, we also justify why we want to normalize the weights from a different perspective. We find that normalizing the weights can implicitly reduce the prior brought by the training data imbalance issue (e.g., the long-tail distribution of the training data). In other words, we argue that normalizing the weights can partially address the training data imbalance problem.  We have an empirical study on the relation between the sample number of each class and the 2-norm of the weights corresponding to the same class (the i-th column of W is associated to the i-th class). By computing the norm of W i and sample number of class i with respect to each class (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 9</ref>), we find that the larger sample number a class has, the larger the associated norm of weights tends to be. We argue that the norm of weights W i with respect to class i is largely determined by its sample distribution and sample number. Therefore, norm of weights W i , ∀i can be viewed as a learned prior hidden in training datasets. Eliminating such prior is often beneficial to face verification. This is because face verification requires to test on a dataset whose idenities can not appear in training datasets, so the prior from training dataset should not be transferred to the testing. This prior may even be harmful to face verification performance. To eliminate such prior, we normalize the norm of weights of FC2 6 . 6 FC2 refers to the fully connected layer in the softmax loss (or A-Softmax loss). Standard CNNs usually preserve the bias term in the fully connected layers, but these bias terms make it difficult to analyze the proposed A-Softmax loss. This is because SphereFace aims to optimize the angle and produce the angular margin. With bias of FC2, the angular geometry interpretation becomes much more difficult to analyze. To facilitate the analysis, we zero out the bias of FC2 following <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By setting the bias of FC2 to zero, the A-Softmax loss has clear geometry interpretation and therefore becomes much easier to analyze. We show all the biases of FC2 from a CASIA-pretrained model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref>. One can observe that the most of the biases are near zero, indicating these biases are not necessarily useful for face verification. Training Set (with bias) Testing Set (with bias) Training Set (without bias) Testing Set (without bias) Visualization on MNIST. We visualize the 2-D feature distribution in MNIST dataset with and without bias in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>. One can observe that zeroing out the bias has no direct influence on the feature distribution. The features learned with and without bias can both make full use of the learning space.</p></div>

It is obvious that with larger m the learned features become much more discriminative due to the larger inter-class angular margin. Most importantly, the learned discriminative features also generalize really well in the testing set.  E. Angular Fisher score for evaluating the feature discriminativeness and ablation study on our proposed modifications</p><p>We first propose an angular Fisher score for evaluating the feature discriminativeness in angular margin feature learning. The angular Fisher score (AFS) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">AF S = S w S b<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where the within-class scatter value is defined as S w = i xj ∈Xi (1 − cos x j , m i ) and the between-class scatter value is defined as S b = i n i (1 − cos m i , m ). X i is the i-th class samples, m i is the mean vector of features from class i, m is the mean vector of the whole dataset, and n i is the sample number of class i. In general, the lower the fisher value is, the more discriminative the features are. Next, we perform a comprehensive ablation study on all the proposed modifications: removing last ReLU, removing Biases, normalizing weights and applying A-Softmax loss. The experiments are performed using the 4-layer CNN described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. The models are trained on CASIA dataset and tested on LFW dataset. The setting is exactly the same as the LFW experiment in the main paper. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 6</ref>, we could observe that all our modification leads to peformance improvement and our A-Softmax could greatly increase the angular feature discriminativeness.</p></div>

The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 7</ref> show that the A-Softmax loss could make best use of the network capacity. With more convolutional layers, the A-Softmax loss (i.e., SphereFace) performs better. Most notably, SphereFace with only 4 convolutional layer could peform better than the softmax loss with 64 convolutional layers, which validates the superiority of our A-Softmax loss.  </p></div>

The annealing optimization strategy for A-Softmax loss</head><p>The optimization of the A-Softmax loss is similar to the L-Softmax loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We use an annealing optimization strategy to train the network with A-Softmax loss. To be simple, the annealing strategy is essentially supervising the newtork from an easy task (i.e., large λ) gradually to a difficult task (i.e., small λ). Specifically, we let f yi = λ xi cos(θy i )+ xi ψ(θy i ) 1+λ and start the stochastic gradient descent initially with a very large λ (it is equivalent to optimizing the original softmax). Then we gradually reduce λ during training. Ideally λ can be gradually reduced to zero, but in practice, a small value will usually suffice. In most of our face experiments, decaying λ to 5 has already lead to impressive results. Smaller λ could potentially yield a better performance but is also more difficult to train.</p></div>
