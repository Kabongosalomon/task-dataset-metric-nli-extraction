However, the emergence of unconventional processors, such as neuromorphic processors, requires approaches which utilize event-based computation. We present work in this paper related to the development of an algorithm which incorporates event-based computation in the identi cation of related vertices in networks or graphs.</p><p>Inspired by the recent work of Shaub et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in which the di erent approaches to community detection are organized according to the problem they are designed to solve (e. g. partitioning problems, clustering problems, dynamical problems), we describe our approach as a hybrid dynamical clustering method which incorporates the discrete time signals of a spiking neuron system. In this paper we present results that serve as a proof-of-concept related to the mapping of recurrent neural networks based on interacting spin dynamics (Hop eld networks) to spiking neural systems.</p><p>Our goal is to construct a system of spiking neurons which can be used to generate a set of spike responses which can identify vertex communities in a graph. We choose to characterize a community in a graph G(V, E) as a subset of vertices ∈ V such that the density of edges internal to this subset is higher than the density of edges connecting to the remainder of the graph. is is similar to de nitions used in other cluster based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. ere is a well known aphorism in Hebbian learning, a ributed to Siegrid Löwel <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>: "neurons that re together are wired together." We use the statement inversion:"neurons that are wired together, re together" to construct our approach to community detection. e vertices and edges of a given graph G are mapped to a network of symmetrically connected spiking neurons, which is then selectively driven by time-dependent external currents. ere must be a degree of similarity between the resulting spike trains which can be used to distinguish individual communities of G. We binary decoding and bipolar decoding of spike trains with similarity between trains measured using a Hamming distance metric. e ability to identify individual communities is dependent on the linear separability of the Hamming distance metric values. is is controlled by the size of the bin width ∆t used in the binary decoding of individual spike trains.</p><p>is approach incorporates Hop eld networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and spin glass models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. It has been shown that recurrent networks with steady states can be used to nd solutions to the problem of graph partitioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. e use of positive and negatively weighted edges is needed to drive the system to a solution which meets the optimization conditions. However, these approaches are o en limited to nding partitions of equal sizes in a graph, or require prior knowledge of the number of communities to nd.</p><p>Hop eld networks have been implemented using spiking neurons for the task of content addressable memories and pa ern retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, in this work we focus on the application of the recurrent neural network model to a task related to graph partitioning. We show in this paper that in conjunction with carefully chosen parameters for our neuron model, these spin-glass based models can be used to nd un-equal sized groups. We establish that spiking data can be used to identify communities.</p><p>Recent works on community detection have focused on how real-world networks may have ambiguous community structure and there are limitations how much information can be inferred from metadata based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In this work we focus on a discussion of how spiking data can be used to identify communities and we work with graphs generated with known communities and xed labels. e graphs analyzed in this paper are all instances of a speci c class of random graphs: Girvan-Newman benchmark graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. ese graphs have 128 vertices organized into 4 equalorder communities of 32 vertices each. e average degree is d = 16. Using these graphs we demonstrate our spike-based approach to community detection, focusing on binary decoding and bipolar decoding of spike trains.</p><p>A graph is mapped to a system of spiking neurons and driven in such a manner that the generated spike trains can be used to reconstruct the known community labels of the original graph. Two neurons (n i , n j ) in Q i=j must have ring pa erns that exhibit a degree of similarity which distinguishes them from the spike trains generated by neurons (n i , n j ) in Q j i . In Section 2, we derive the theoretical structure which underlies the main components of our approach. We begin with how a graph G is mapped to a spiking neural network (SNN). en, we discuss how the physical parameters associated with the spiking neuron system must be set and how the selective driving of this SNN must be done in order to generate a set of spike trains are generated that can distinguish a single community Q i from the remaining Q j i . In Sections 3 and 4 we describe how spike responses are decoded and we discuss the metrics we use to analyze decoded spike trains. is paper presents on results which establish proof-of-concept that a mapping and driving pa ern exists which can be used to generate spike trains characteristic of a graph's known community structure. In Section 5 we introduce how our spiking neural networks can be incorporated into existing community detection algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SPIKING NEURON MODEL CONSTRUCTION</head><p>We focus on community detection in undirected, unweighted graphs. A graph is de ned by a vertex set and an edge set G = G(V, E).</p><p>Multiple edges and self-loops are not allowed. In this initial work, we study graphs with clearly delineated (non-overlapping) communities. SNNs are dynamical systems which compute without the use of steady states <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Information is transmi ed through electrical pulses. e neurons which compose the spiking network are nonlinear units and can exhibit a rich set of dynamics and ring pa erns based on the physical parameters. We use few parameters to build our SNNs; they are leaky-integrate and re neurons dened by a threshold voltage ( th ), a refractory period (t r ), and a time constant (τ ). e full spiking network itself S(N, W) is de ned by a set of homogeneous neurons N = {n i }, and a set of symmetrically connected synapsesW = {s(w) i j }, weighted edges which connect neurons n i ↔ n j .</p><p>For a graph G(V, E), we assume there is a set of known vertex communities {Q i } such that i Q i = V(G) and no vertex exists in more than one community. e remainder of this paper will develop how spiking systems can identify individual communities Q i . e mapping of an undirected, unweighted graph to SNN is analogous to the construction of a Hop eld recurrent neural network; using symmetric connections which are either positive or negatively weighted. e two-step mapping rst de nes a SNN by de ning a spiking neuron for each vertex on the graph: i ∈ V → n i ∈ N, and each edge on the graph de nes a symmetric pair of excitatory</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">synapses e i j ∈ E → s(w + ) i j , s(w + ) ji ∈ W, w + &gt; 0.</formula><p>is SNN is then transformed to a fully connected SNN by the addition of symmetric pairs of inhibitory synapses s(w − ) jk , s(w − ) k j ∈ W, w − &lt; 0 for any edges which do not exist on the original graph. e magnitudes of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses are equal |s(w + )| = |s(w − )|.</p><p>Leaky integrate and re neurons are simpli ed models of neuronal behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We work with these models because of their close proximity to the behavior of the IBM TrueNorth processor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. e resulting networks of spiking neurons do not require extensive detail about the biological behavior, nor are they an attempt to describe cortical network dynamics. We focus on a model of the membrane potential in which the potential i (t) of a single neuron is a time-dependent function which changes depending on discrete or continuous inputs. Discrete signals are measured upon the arrival of positively and negatively weighted spikes ∆ = s(w ± ), any external driving force term in V ex t (t) is assumed to be continuous. Additionally, we use the existence of a non-zero leak τ to continuously relax (t) to an equilibrium value r .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d( i (t)) dt = V ex t (t) − i (t) τ (1) V ex t (t) = I ex t (t)R + t , j→i s(w) i j δ (t − t )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>If a neuron's potential exceeds the ring threshold th , it res a spike along its synaptic connections and enters a refractory period t R during which its potential is not changed. e choice of the neuron system parameters is determined by whether they are used to generate similar spike trains, or to enhance dissimilarity between spike trains. e refractory period t R is needed to impose a sense of directionality to the spread of spiking pa erns. Aided by the positively weighted synapses, spike responses spread to neurons that have not yet red. ese correspond to connected vertices on the graph and lead to similarities in spike trains of neurons n i , n j in the same community Q i . e parameters that lead to dissimilar spike trains are those which help to impede the spread of spiking pa erns across several neurons in a system, primarily the negatively weighted synaptic connections. Many parameters play a dual role, necessary for both creating similar spike trains and to inhibit spike pa ern spread. e time constant (τ ) is balanced to ensure arriving spikes can accumulate and lead to secondary ring while also ensuring that the e ects of spike impulses are not long-lived, the ring threshold t h ensures that a neuron res in response to incoming spike impulses only when multiple impulses arrive in a short time window.</p><p>For a set of homogeneous spiking neurons, there are many system parameters which are tunable in order to generate spiking pa erns which are informative about the original graph's community structure. Previously, we have studied how the simplest Hop eld network could be mapped to a system of spiking networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> we considered graphs with fully connected communities connected by a single bridge bond (barbell graphs). ese networks could be driven using a pair of sinusoidal currents out of phase by 180 degrees. e negative driving current, as well as a careful tuning of neuron system parameters (refractory period, time constant, ring threshold and synaptic weight) was su cient to generate spike trains characteristic of the two communities. In this work we generalize our approach to a system connected as a spin glass, the role of the negative driving current is replaced by the negatively weighted synapses, which inhibit the growth and limit the occurrences of spike cascades. e neuron dynamics under square pulse driving are relatively simple. Only one neuron is actively driven by a square pulse at any time (t), and the e ects from the refractory period t R allow for the equations of motion in Eq. (2) to be separated as: a set of equation to describe the ring dynamics under active driving, and one set of equations to describe the ring dynamics as a reaction to a neighbor being actively driven. e equation for the square pulse is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V ex t (t) = A max [tanh (β[t − t 1 ]) − tanh (β[t 2 − t])]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>e shape of the square pulse is determined by the pulse height (A max ), pulse width (t A = t 2 − t 1 ), and the parameter β which determines the sharpness of the pulse's rise. e gap between subsequent pulses applied to di erent neurons is su ciently large such that any ∆V induced by V ex t on neuron n i has decayed away before neuron n j is actively driven. e parameter β controls the sharpness of the square pulse. A sharp step is needed to ensure that spikes are red only when the external current is a constant driving force, I max = 2A max /R, however the function V ex t (t) must remain continuous. Under active square pulse driving, e ect of the constant driving force leads to a constant ring rate (δ ), which can be found by integrating the equation of motion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d( (t)) dt = V ex t (t) − (t) τ ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and is found in terms of the time constant τ , the square pulse amplitude A max , the reset voltage 0 and the spike threshold voltage</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">th : δ τ = log 2A max − 0 2A max − th .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>e ring rate δ can be used to determine the synaptic weight s w with this assumption that a neuron (n j ) will re a spike in response to one of its nearest neighbors (n i , s(w + ) (i→j) &gt; 0) being actively driven when 2 spikes arrive at n j in a short time span. Se ing s w = α th (0 &lt; α &lt; 1), the rst spike arrives at t 0 and increases the potential j (t 0 ) = 0 + s(w + ). e arrival of the second spike happens at t = δ and the resulting potential must exceed the spike threshold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">j (t 0 + δ ) &gt; th .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Again integrating the dynamical equation for j during time t : [t 0 , t 0 + δ ] is straightforward since there is no active driving. e inequality in Eq.

For the Girvan-Newman benchmark graphs studied in this paper, the communities are known to each be of order 32 and d = 16. For a lower bound on the minimum number of spikes a neuron can re and still be counted as being a member of a community, we make the assumption that at least half of a vertex's neighbors must be in the same community. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: e full spike raster for a Girvan-Newman benchmark graph instance.

For an instance of the Girvan-Newman benchmark graph it is shown that when 3 of the 4 communities are driven, the similarity between spike trains in the same driven community is signi cantly higher than the similarity between spike trains in di erent communities. Additionally, the un-driven community never exhibits a signicant degree of spike response, showing that the spread of spiking synchronicity throughout the entire network is impeded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">IDENTIFYING UNKNOWN COMMUNITIES</head><p>Future development of spike-based community detection is dependent on how well spiking neuron systems can be incorporated into existing algorithms. ere exists a near linear algorithm for community identi cation called "label propagation, " introduced in 2007 by Raghavan, Albert and Kumara <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. e similarity between this method and a Po s spin model have been noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and we consider label propagation to be an algorithm that can incorporate spike-based data. However there are several obstacles to overcome before spiking neuron systems can be incorporated into real-world community identi cation tasks. First, we need to know how a neuron's spike response is a ected when the neurons are driven in a random order. We use the Girvan-Newman benchmark graph shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, but instead of the showing how neurons in each community react when active driving is applied to neurons in Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 4 (respectively). e (red, dashed) horizontal is an upper bound on the total number of spikes that would be generated under square pulse driving of a K 32 community. e (black,dashed) line is a lower bound generated by using the mean degree d = 16 and the assumption that at least half of a neuron's neighbors have the same community label.</p><p>community-ordered driving used in Sections 3 and 4, we randomly permute and drive the entire neuron set. Randomly permuting the neuron set reduces the usefulness of bipolar decoding and the spiking data analysis in this section only uses binary decoding. Additionally, when randomly driving neurons, ∆t must be carefully chosen such that the response between subsequent driven neurons are not covered by a single time window. If that happens, then any distinction between signals belonging to individual neurons which may have di erent community labels may be lost. ere is now an upper bound on the time window: ∆t &lt; t A .</p><p>Second, the scalability of the Hamming metric of Eq. 9 is quite poor. Analysis of larger graphs will require driving a large number of neurons and the length of the binary decoded spike trains will rapidly increase. As the length a binary decoded spike train increases, the similarity between two neurons that re frequently will become quite large. To remedy this, we return to the original implementation of Hamming metric as de ned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Returning to the Hamming metric as originally de ned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> does not a ect the comparison matrix structure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>) and using the Hamming metric, we show how spiking data can be used in label propagation algorithms. Label propagation is done by choosing a vertex to act as a "source, " xing its label, then updating the labels of all its neighboring vertices. For spiking data to be incorporated into this method, we need to ensure that the choice of source does not signi cantly impact the linear separability of the Hamming metric values. e role of ∆t in tuning this quality is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>: at ∆t = 3.2 (sec) the mean Hamming metric value is de ned as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H (x m i , x n j ) i = 1 |Q m | i ∈Q n i j H (x m i , x n j ).<label>(12)</label></formula><p>If m = n, the self-similarity value H (x m i , x m i ) = 1.00 is excluded. When the source and target are in di erent labelled communities (n m) the mean metric is nearly overlapping, but when the source and target are in the same community, the mean is nearly 1.00. e linear separability of the mean metric value is dependent on the size of ∆t, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our approach to a community detection using spike-based computing depended on vertices within the same community exhibiting similar spiking pa erns. We have studied how SNNs can be constructed, driven by external current, and decoded in order to generate such spiking pa erns. An undirected graph is mapped to a fully connected set of homogeneous spiking neurons, with both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and selectively driven by square pulse currents. e neurons contained within densely connected regions exhibit synchronicity in their ring pa erns. Spike trains are decoded by time window binning, using varying window widths (∆t). For ∆t &lt; t A the resulting binned vectors are converted into binary codes, with entries {0, 1} only. From these binary vectors and a Hamming-distance based metric, we construct a comparison matrix which had dimension n × n for a graph of order n. e degree of similarity between spike trains can be quanti ed and used to infer the membership of communities on the original graph. For ∆t ≈ |Q i |(t A + δ pulse ) the resulting vectors tabulate the number of spikes red during ∆t and use a pre-determined threshold to determine the appropriate label to assign to the neurons.</p><p>Using binary decoding, the driven communities could be distinguished by the Hamming metric similarity. Simulations of spiking neuron dynamics demonstrated the ability to identify nonoverlapping, communities of equal order (see Figs. 2, 5) for graphs with known community structure. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, it was seen that the use of inhibitory synaptic connections prevented any large scale spike cascade. e Hamming metric can distinguish a single community when a neuron system is driven sequentially according to community, or when the neuron set is randomly permuted. Bipolar decoding, assigning community labels according to the spike counts, can distinguish the driven communities by the dominant spiking behavior. However, the bipolar decoding is only used when a neuron system is driven sequentially according to community. e results presented here are generated from one instance of the Girvan-Newman benchmark graph (shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>, multiple instances have been tested with similar results. Additional simulations have also been tested on graphs with unequal-sized communities. We explore how our method performs on un-ordered data, by randomly permuting and driving the entire neuron set. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, the linear separability of the Hamming metric value shows that for small enough ∆t value, the Hamming metric can distinguish one community from the remaining 3 communities.</p><p>Our results show that spiking data can be used to identify communities in undirected graphs. e separability of the Hamming similarity measure (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>) could be incorporated into a label propagation work ow <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Community detection is a unique use of neuromorphic hardware, utilizing neural systems that do not have hidden units, or require training over large data sets.</p><p>Future work related to spike-based community detection will investigate two areas: the applicability, and the scalability of this method. Applicability focuses on quantifying the limits of a spikebased approach: e ectiveness on other graph classes, identi cation of overlapping communities, and establishing a resolution limit (smallest community that can be identi ed in a large network). Scalability addresses how this method can be applied to large network analysis. In particular, as presented in this work, the binary analysis has the potential for poor scaling: a system of n vertices is mapped to a densely connected system of n neurons and produces a matrix of dimension n × n. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: For an instance of the Girvan-Newman graph on 128 vertices, the complete neuron set is randomly permuted, then every neuron is individually driven by a square pulse. e mean Hamming metric H (x m i , x m j ) i for source and target in the same community (black) can be distinguished from the mean Hamming metric mean Hamming metric H (x m i , x n j ) i for source and target in di erent communities (red, blue, green) if the bin width ∆t is small. e standard deviation in the mean is shown by the shaded regions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>j</head><label></label><figDesc>in the same community, compared to an o -diagonal block in which a driven neuron x (n) i and target neuron x</figDesc></figure>
