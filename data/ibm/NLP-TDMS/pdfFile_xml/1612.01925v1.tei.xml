<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The FlowNet demonstrated that optical flow estimation can be cast as a learning problem. However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods.

In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a subnetwork specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The FlowNet by Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> represented a paradigm shift in optical flow estimation. The idea of using a simple convolutional CNN architecture to directly learn the concept of optical flow from data was completely disjoint from all the established approaches. However, first implementations of new ideas often have a hard time competing with highly fine-tuned existing methods, and FlowNet was no exception to this rule. It is the successive consolidation that resolves the negative effects and helps us appreciate the benefits of new ways of thinking.</p><p>At the same time, it resolves problems with small displacements and noisy artifacts in estimated flow fields. This leads to a dramatic performance improvement on real-world applications such as action recognition and motion segmentation, bringing FlowNet 2.0 to the state-of-the-art level. The way towards FlowNet 2.0 is via several evolutionary, but decisive modifications that are not trivially connected to the observed problems. First, we evaluate the influence of dataset schedules. Interestingly, the more sophisticated training data provided by Mayer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> leads to inferior results if used in isolation. However, a learning schedule consisting of multiple datasets improves results significantly. In this scope, we also found that the FlowNet version with an explicit correlation layer outperforms the version without such layer. This is in contrast to the results reported in Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>As a second contribution, we introduce a warping operation and show how stacking multiple networks using this operation can significantly improve the results. By varying the depth of the stack and the size of individual components we obtain many network variants with different size and runtime. This allows us to control the trade-off between accuracy and computational resources. We provide networks for the spectrum between 8fps and 140fps.</p><p>Finally, we focus on small, subpixel motion and realworld data. To this end, we created a special training dataset and a specialized network. We show that the architecture trained with this dataset performs well on small motions typical for real-world videos. To reach optimal performance on arbitrary displacements, we add a network that learns to fuse the former stacked network with the small displace- </p></div>

The final network outperforms the previous FlowNet by a large margin and performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on the Sintel and KITTI benchmarks. It can estimate small and large displacements with very high level of detail while providing interactive frame rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>End-to-end optical flow estimation with convolutional networks was proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Their model, dubbed FlowNet, takes a pair of images as input and outputs the flow field. Following FlowNet, several papers have studied optical flow estimation with CNNs: featuring a 3D convolutional network <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, an unsupervised learning objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, carefully designed rotationally invariant architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, or a pyramidal approach based on the coarse-to-fine idea of variational methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. None of these methods significantly outperforms the original FlowNet.</p><p>An alternative approach to learning-based optical flow estimation is to use CNNs for matching image patches. Thewlis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> formulate Deep Matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> as a convolutional network and optimize it end-to-end. Gadot &amp; Wolf <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Bailer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> learn image patch descriptors using Siamese network architectures. These methods can reach good accuracy, but require exhaustive matching of patches. Thus, they are restrictively slow for most practical applications. Moreover, patch based approaches lack the possibility to use the larger context of the whole image because they operate on small image patches.</p><p>Convolutional networks trained for per-pixel prediction tasks often produce noisy or blurry results. As a remedy, out-of-the-box optimization can be applied to the network predictions as a postprocessing operation, for example, optical flow estimates can be refined with a variational approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In some cases, this refinement can be approximated by neural networks: Chen &amp; Pock <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> formulate reaction diffusion model as a CNN and apply it to image denoising, deblocking and superresolution. Recently, it has been shown that similar refinement can be obtained by stacking several convolutional networks on top of each other. This led to improved results in human pose estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> and semantic instance segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In this paper we adapt the idea of stacking multiple networks to optical flow estimation.</p><p>Our network architecture includes warping layers that compensate for some already estimated preliminary motion in the second image. The concept of image warping is common to all contemporary variational optical flow methods and goes back to the work of Lucas &amp; Kanade <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In Brox et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> it was shown to correspond to a numerical fixed point iteration scheme coupled with a continuation method.</p><p>The strategy of training machine learning models on a series of gradually increasing tasks is known as curriculum learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The idea dates back at least to Elman <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, who showed that both the evolution of tasks and the network architectures can be beneficial in the language processing scenario. In this paper we revisit this idea in the context of computer vision and show how it can lead to dramatic performance improvement on a complex real-world task of optical flow estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dataset Schedules</head><p>High quality training data is crucial for the success of supervised training. We investigated the differences in the quality of the estimated optical flow depending on the presented training data. Interestingly, it turned out that not only the kind of data is important but also the order in which it is presented during training.</p><p>The original FlowNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> were trained on the Fly-ingChairs dataset (we will call it Chairs). This rather simplistic dataset contains about 22k image pairs of chairs superimposed on random background images from Flickr. Random affine transformations are applied to chairs and background to obtain the second image and ground truth flow fields. The dataset contains only planar motions.</p><p>The FlyingThings3D (Things3D) dataset proposed by Mayer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> can be seen as a three-dimensional version of the FlyingChairs. The dataset consists of 22k renderings of random scenes showing 3D models from the ShapeNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> moving in front of static 3D backgrounds. In contrast to Chairs, the images show true 3D motion and lighting effects and there is more variety among the object models.</p><p>We tested the two network architectures introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>: FlowNetS, which is a straightforward encoder-decoder architecture, and FlowNetC, which includes explicit correlation of feature maps. We trained FlowNetS and FlowNetC on Chairs and Things3D and an equal mixture of samples from both datasets using the different learning rate schedules shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The basic schedule S short (600k iterations) corresponds to Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> except some minor changes 1 . Apart from this basic schedule S short , we investigated a longer schedule S long with 1.2M iterations, and a schedule for finetuning S fine with smaller learning rates. Results of networks trained on Chairs and Things3D with the different schedules are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The results lead to the following observations:</p><p>The order of presenting training data with different properties matters. Although Things3D is more realistic, training on Things3D alone leads to worse results than training on Chairs. The best results are consistently achieved when first training on Chairs and only then fine-tuning on Things3D. This schedule also outperforms training on a mixture of Chairs and Things3D. We conjecture that the simpler Chairs dataset helps the network learn the general concept of color matching without developing possibly confusing priors for 3D motion and realistic lighting too early. The result indicates the importance of training data schedules for avoiding shortcuts when learning generic concepts with deep networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> (1) We do not start with a learning rate of 1e − 6 and increase it first, but we start with 1e − 4 immediately. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We fix the learning rate for 300k iterations and then divide it by 2 every 100k iterations. FlowNetC outperforms FlowNetS. The result we got with FlowNetS and S short corresponds to the one reported in Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, we obtained much better results on FlowNetC. We conclude that Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> did not train FlowNetS and FlowNetC under the exact same conditions. When done so, the FlowNetC architecture compares favorably to the FlowNetS architecture.</p><p>Improved results. Just by modifying datasets and training schedules, we improved the FlowNetS result reported by Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by ∼ 25% and the FlowNetC result by ∼ 30%.</p><p>In this section, we did not yet use specialized training sets for specialized scenarios. The trained network is rather supposed to be generic and to work well in various scenarios. An additional optional component in dataset schedules is fine-tuning of a generic network to a specific scenario, such as the driving scenario, which we show in Section 6. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stack</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Stacking Networks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Stacking Two Networks for Flow Refinement</head><p>All state-of-the-art optical flow approaches rely on iterative methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Can deep networks also benefit from iterative refinement? To answer this, we experiment with stacking multiple FlowNetS and FlowNetC architectures.</p><p>The first network in the stack always gets the images I 1 and I 2 as input. Subsequent networks get I 1 , I 2 , and the previous flow estimate w i = (u i , v i ) , where i denotes the index of the network in the stack.</p><p>To make assessment of the previous error and computing an incremental update easier for the network, we also optionally warp the second image I 2 (x, y) via the flow w i and bilinear interpolation toĨ 2,i (x, y) = I 2 (x+u i , y +v i ). This way, the next network in the stack can focus on the remaining increment between I 1 andĨ 2,i . When using warping, we additionally provideĨ 2,i and the error e i = ||Ĩ 2,i − I 1 || as input to the next network; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Thanks to bilinear interpolation, the derivatives of the warping operation can be computed (see supplemental material for details). This enables training of stacked networks end-to-end. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the effect of stacking two networks, the effect of warping, and the effect of end-to-end training. We take the best FlowNetS from Section 3 and add another FlowNetS on top. The second network is initialized randomly and then the stack is trained on Chairs with the schedule S long . We experimented with two scenarios: keeping the weights of the first network fixed, or updating them together with the weights of the second network. In the latter case, the weights of the first network are fixed for the first 400k iterations to first provide a good initialization of the second network. We report the error on Sintel train clean and on the test set of Chairs. Since the Chairs test set is much more similar to the training data than Sintel, comparing results on both datasets allows us to detect tendencies to over-fitting.</p><p>We make the following observations: (1) Just stacking networks without warping improves results on Chairs but decreases performance on Sintel, i.e. the stacked network is over-fitting. Clearly, since the stacked network is twice as big as the single network, over-fitting is an issue. The positive effect of flow refinement after warping can counteract this problem, yet the best of both is obtained when the stacked networks are trained one after the other, since this avoids overfitting while having the benefit of flow refinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Stacking Multiple Diverse Networks</head><p>Rather than stacking identical networks, it is possible to stack networks of different type (FlowNetC and FlowNetS). Reducing the size of the individual networks is another valid option. We now investigate different combinations and additionally also vary the network size.</p><p>We call the first network the bootstrap network as it differs from the second network by its inputs. The second network could however be repeated an arbitray number of times in a recurrent fashion. We conducted this experiment and found that applying a network with the same weights multiple times and also fine-tuning this recurrent part does not improve results (see supplemental material for details). As also done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, we therefore add networks with different weights to the stack. Compared to identical weights, stacking networks with different weights increases the memory footprint, but does not increase the runtime. In this case the top networks are not constrained to a general improvement of their input, but can perform different tasks at different stages and the stack can be trained in smaller  pieces by fixing existing networks and adding new networks one-by-one. We do so by using the Chairs→Things3D schedule from Section 3 for every new network and the best configuration with warping from Section 4.1. Furthermore, we experiment with different network sizes and alternatively use FlowNetS or FlowNetC as a bootstrapping network. We use FlowNetC only in case of the bootstrap network, as the input to the next network is too diverse to be properly handeled by the Siamese structure of FlowNetC. Smaller size versions of the networks were created by taking only a fraction of the number of channels for every layer in the network. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the network accuracy and runtime for different network sizes of a single FlowNetS. Factor 3 8 yields a good trade-off between speed and accuracy when aiming for faster networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notation:</head><p>We denote networks trained by the Chairs→Things3D schedule from Section 3 starting with FlowNet2. Networks in a stack are trained with this schedule one-by-one. For the stack configuration we append upper-or lower-case letters to indicate the original FlowNet or the thin version with <ref type="bibr">3 8</ref> of the channels. E.g: FlowNet2-CSS stands for a network stack consisting of one FlowNetC and two FlowNetS. FlowNet2-css is the same but with fewer channels. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows the performance of different network stacks. Most notably, the final FlowNet2-CSS result improves by ∼ 30% over the single network FlowNet2-C from Section 3 and by ∼ 50% over the original FlowNetC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Furthermore, two small networks in the beginning always outperform one large network, despite being faster and having fewer weights: FlowNet2-ss (11M weights) over FlowNet2-S (38M weights), and FlowNet2-cs (11M weights) over FlowNet2-C (38M weights). Training smaller units step by step proves to be advantageous and enables  us to train very deep networks for optical flow. At last, FlowNet2-s provides nearly the same accuracy as the original FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, while running at 140 frames per second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Small Displacements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Datasets</head><p>While the original FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> performed well on the Sintel benchmark, limitations in real-world applications have become apparent. In particular, the network cannot reliably estimate small motions (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). This is counter-intuitive, since small motions are easier for traditional methods, and there is no obvious reason why networks should not reach the same performance in this setting. Thus, we examined the training data and compared it to the UCF101 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> as one example of real-world data. While Chairs are similar to Sintel, UCF101 is fundamentally different (we refer to our supplemental material for the analysis): Sintel is an action movie and as such contains many fast movements that are difficult for traditional methods, while the displacements we see in the UCF101 dataset are much smaller, mostly smaller than 1 pixel. Thus, we created a dataset in the visual style of Chairs but with very small displacements and a displacement histogram much more like UCF101. We also added cases with a background that is homogeneous or just consists of color gradients. We call this dataset ChairsSDHom and will release it upon publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Small Displacement Network and Fusion</head><p>We fine-tuned our FlowNet2-CSS network for smaller displacements by further training the whole network stack on a mixture of Things3D and ChairsSDHom and by applying a non-linearity to the error to downweight large displacements 2 . We denote this network by FlowNet2-CSS-ft-sd.</p><p>This increases performance on small displacements and we found that this particular mixture does not sacrifice performance on large displacements. However, in case of subpixel motion, noise still remains a problem and we conjecture that the FlowNet architecture might in general not be perfect for such motion. Therefore, we slightly modified the original FlowNetS architecture and removed the stride 2 in the first layer. We made the beginning of the network deeper by exchanging the 7×7 and 5×5 kernels in the beginning with multiple 3 × 3 kernels 2 . Because noise tends to be a problem with small displacements, we add convolutions between the upconvolutions to obtain smoother estimates as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We denote the resulting architecture by FlowNet2-SD; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we created a small network that fuses FlowNet2-CSS-ft-sd and FlowNet2-SD (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). The fusion network receives the flows, the flow magnitudes and the errors in brightness after warping as input. It contracts the resolution two times by a factor of 2 and expands again 2 . Contrary to the original FlowNet architecture it expands to the full resolution. We find that this produces crisp motion boundaries and performs well on small as well as on large displacements. We denote the final network as FlowNet2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experiments</head><p>We compare the best variants of our network to stateof-the-art approaches on public bechmarks. In addition, we provide a comparison on application tasks, such as motion segmentation and action recognition. This allows benchmarking the method on real data.</p></div>

All methods with comparable runtimes have clearly inferior accuracy. We fine-tuned FlowNet2 on a mixture of Sintel clean+final training data (FlowNet2-ft-sintel). On the benchmark, in case of clean data this slightly degraded the result, while on final data FlowNet2-ft-sintel is on par with the currently published state-of-the art method Deep-DiscreteFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>KITTI: On KITTI, the results of FlowNet2-CSS are comparable to EpicFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and FlowFields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MPI Sintel (train final)</head><p>Average EPE Runtime (milliseconds per frame) tuning on small displacement data degrades the result. This is probably due to KITTI containing very large displacements in general. Fine-tuning on a combination of the KITTI2012 and KITTI2015 training sets reduces the error roughly by a factor of 3 (FlowNet2-ft-kitti). Among nonstereo methods we obtain the best EPE on KITTI2012 and the first rank on the KITTI2015 benchmark. This shows how well and elegantly the learning approach can integrate the prior of the driving scenario. Middlebury: On the Middlebury training set FlowNet2 performs comparable to traditional methods. The results on the Middlebury test set are unexpectedly a lot worse. Still, there is a large improvement compared to FlowNetS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Endpoint error vs. runtime evaluations for Sintel are provided in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. One can observe that the FlowNet2 family outperforms the best and fastest existing methods by large margins. Depending on the type of application, a FlowNet2 variant between 8 to 140 frames per second can be used. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 6 and 7</ref> show example results on Sintel and on real-world data. While the performance on Sintel is similar to FlowFields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we can see that on real world data FlowNet 2.0 clearly has advantages in terms of being robust to homogeneous regions (rows 2 and 5), image and compression artifacts (rows 3 and 4) and it yields smooth flow fields with sharp motion boundaries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented several improvements to the FlowNet idea that have led to accuracy that is fully on par with stateof-the-art methods while FlowNet 2.0 runs orders of magnitude faster. We have quantified the effect of each contribution and showed that all play an important role. The experiments on motion segmentation and action recognition show that the estimated optical flow with FlowNet 2.0 is reliable on a large variety of scenes and applications. The FlowNet 2.0 family provides networks running at speeds from 8 to 140fps. This further extends the possible range of applications. While the results on Middlebury indicate imperfect performance on subpixel motion, FlowNet 2.0 results highlight very crisp motion boundaries, retrieval of fine structures, and robustness to compression artifacts. Thus, we expect it to become the working horse for all applications that require accurate and fast optical flow computation.

We provide the endpoint error when testing on the KITTI2015 train dataset. Table 1 in the main paper shows the performance of the same networks on Sintel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Recurrently Stacking Networks with the Same Weights</head><p>The bootstrap network differs from the succeeding networks by its task (it needs to predict a flow field from scratch) and inputs (it does not get a previous flow estimate and a warped image). The network after the bootstrap network only refines the previous flow estimate, so it can be applied to its own output recursively. We took the best network from <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> of the main paper and applied Net2 recursively multiple times. We then continued training the whole stack with multiple Net2. The difference from our final FlowNet2 architecture is that here the weights are shared between the stacked networks, similar to a standard recurrent network. Results are given in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. In all cases we observe no or negligible improvements compared to the baseline network with a single Net2.</p></div>

In the two bottom rows we show the results of fine-tuning the stack of the top networks on Chairs for 100k more iterations. This leads to a minor improvement of performance. to Sintel, UCF101 is fundamentally different and contains much more small displacments. To create a training dataset similar to UCF101, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we generated our ChairsSDHom (Chairs Small Displacement Homogeneous) dataset by randomly placing and moving chairs in front of randomized background images. However, we also followed Mayer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in that our chairs are not flat 2D bitmaps as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, but rendered 3D objects. Similar to Mayer et al., we rendered our data first in a "raw" version to get blend-free flow boundaries and then a second time with antialiasing to obtain the color images. To match the characteristic contents of the UCF101 dataset, we mostly applied small motions. We added scenes with weakly textured background to the dataset, being monochrome or containing a very subtle color gradient. Such monotonous backgrounds are not unusual in natural videos, but almost never appear in Chairs or Things3D. A featureless background can potentially move in any direction (an extreme case of the aperture problem), so we kept these background images fixed to introduce a meaningful prior into the dataset. Example images from the dataset are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> </p></div>

We experimented with different configurations to avoid sacrificing performance on   large displacements. We found the best performance can be achieved by training with mini-batches of 8 samples: 2 from Things3D and 6 from ChairsSDHom. Furthermore, we applied a nonlinearity of x 0.4 to the endpoint error to emphasize the small-magnitude flows.</p></div>

The input to the small displacement network is formed by concatenating both RGB images, resulting in 6 input channels. The network is in general similar to FlowNetS. Differences are the smaller strides and smaller kernel sizes in the beginning and the convolutions between the upconvolutions.</p><p>The fusion network is trained to merge the flow estimates of two previously trained networks, and this task dictates the input structure. We feed the following data into the network: the first image from the image pair, two estimated flow fields, their magnitudes, and finally the two squared Euclidean photoconsistency errors, that is, perpixel squared Euclidean distance between the first image and the second image warped with the predicted flow field. This sums up to 11 channels. Note that we do not input Displacement magnitude (zoom into orange box) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.

The Chairs dataset very closely follows the Sintel dataset, while our ChairsSDHom datasets is close to UCF101.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Intermediate Results in Stacked Networks</head><p>The idea of the stacked network architecture is that the estimated flow field is gradually improved by every network in the stack. This improvement has been quantitatively shown in the paper. Here, we additionally show qualitative examples which clearly highlight this effect. The improvement is especially dramatic for small displacements, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. The initial prediction of FlowNet2-C is very noisy, but is then significantly refined by the two succeeding networks. The FlowNet2-SD network, specifically trained on small displacements, estimates small displacements well even without additional refinement. Best results are obtained by fusing both estimated flow fields. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> illustrates this for a large displacement case. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows runtime vs. endpoint error comparisons of various optical flow estimation methods on two datasets: Sintel (also shown in the main paper) and KITTI2012. In both cases models of the FlowNet 2.0 family offer an excellent speed/accuracy trade-off. Networks fine-tuned on KITTI are not shown. The corresponding points would be below the lower border of the KITTI2012 plot. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows detailed results on motion segmentation obtained using the algorithms from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> with flow fields from different methods as input.
