<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Architecture design has become a crucial component of successful deep learning. Recent progress in automatic neural architecture search (NAS) shows a lot of promise. However, discovered architectures often fail to generalize in the final evaluation. Architectures with a higher validation accuracy during the search phase may perform worse in the evaluation (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Aiming to alleviate this common issue, we introduce sequential greedy architecture search (SGAS), an efficient method for neural architecture search. By dividing the search procedure into subproblems, SGAS chooses and prunes candidate operations in a greedy fashion. We apply SGAS to search architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Extensive experiments show that SGAS is able to find state-of-the-art architectures for tasks such as image classification, point cloud classification and node classification in protein-protein interaction graphs with minimal computational cost. arXiv:1912.00195v2 [cs.</p><p>LG] 2 Apr 2020 chitecture search. However, despite their success, current approaches still have a lot of limitations. During the search phase, network architectures are usually constructed from basic building blocks and evaluated on a validation set. Due to computational cost, the size of considered architectures is limited. In the evaluation phase, the best building blocks are used to construct larger architectures and they are evaluated on the test set. As a result there is a large discrepancy between the validation accuracy during search and the test accuracy during evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel greedy architecture search algorithm, SGAS, which addresses this discrepancy and searches very efficiently.</p><p>Contributions. Our contributions can be summarized as the following: (1) We propose SGAS, a greedy approach for neural architecture search with high correlation between the validation accuracy during the search phase and the final evaluation accuracy.</p><p>(2) Our method discovers topperforming architectures with much less search cost than previous state-of-the-art methods such as DARTS.</p><p>(3) Our proposed method is able to search architectures for both CNNs and GCNs across various datasets and tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by learning features directly from data. As a result deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on many difficult tasks such as image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, object tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, depth estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and activity understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, to name just a few examples. While there was a big emphasis on feature engineering before deep learning, the focus has now shifted to architecture engineering. In particular many novel architectures have been proposed, such as LeCun <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, VGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, GoogLeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, DenseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, ResNeXt <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and SENet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Results on each of the above mentioned tasks keep improving every year by innovations in architecture design. In essence, the community has shifted from feature engineering to architecture engineering. * equal contribution In recent years, many efforts have been made to reduce the manual intervention required to obtain better models for a particular task. As a matter of fact, a new area of research, commonly referred to as meta-learning, has emerged in order to tackle such problems. The idea of metalearning is to leverage prior experience in order to quickly find good algorithm configurations, network architectures and any required parameters for a new learning task. Examples of recent meta-learning approaches include automatic hyper-parameter search <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, data-augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, finding novel optimizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and architecture search <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. In particular, architecture search has sparked a lot of interest in the community. In this task, the search space is huge and manual search is prohibitive.</p><p>Early work by Zoph et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, based on Reinforcement Learning, has shown very promising results. However, its high computational cost has prevented widespread adoption. Recently, differentiable architecture search (DARTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> has been proposed as an alternative which makes architecture search differentiable and much more efficient. This has opened up a path towards computationally feasible ar-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>In the past, considerable success was achieved with hand-crafted architectures. One of the earliest successful architectures was LeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a very simple convolutional neural network for optical character recognition. Other prominent networks include AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, VGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and GoogLeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> which revolutionized computer vision by outperforming all previous approaches in the ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> challenge by a large margin. ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and DenseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> were further milestones in architecture design. They showed the importance of residual and dense connections for designing very deep networks, an insight that influences modern architecture design to this day. Until recently, architecture innovations were a result of human insight and experimentation. The first successful attempts for architecture search were using reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> and evolutionary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. These works were extended with NASNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> where a new cell-based search space and regularization technique were proposed. Another extension, ENAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, represents the entire search space as a single directed acyclic graph. A controller discovers architectures by searching for subgraphs that maximize the expected reward on the validation set. This setup allows for parameter sharing between child models making search very efficient. Further, PNAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> introduced a sequential modelbased optimization (SMBO) strategy in order to search for structures of increasing complexity. PNAS needs to evaluate 5 times less models and reduces the computational cost by a factor of 8 compared to NASNet. Yet, PNAS still requires thousands of GPU hours. One shot approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> further reduce the search time by training a single over-parameterized network with inherited/shared weights. In order to search in a continuous domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposes a continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, making architecture search differentiable and hence much more efficient. As a result, DARTS is able to find good convolutional architectures at a fraction of the computational cost making NAS broadly accessible. Owed to the large success of DARTS, several extensions have been proposed recently. SNAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> optimizes parameters of a joint distribution for the search space in a cell. The authors propose a search gradient which optimizes the same objective as RL-based NAS, but leads to more efficient structural decisions. P-DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> attempts to overcome the depth gap issue between search and evaluation. This is accomplished by increasing the depth of searched architectures gradually during the training procedure. PC-DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> leverages the redundancy in network space and only samples a subset of channels in super-net during search to reduce computation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preliminary -DARTS</head><p>By reducing the search problem to searching for the best cell structure, cell-based NAS methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> are able to learn scalable and transferable architectures. The networks are composed of layers with identical cell structure but different weights. A cell is usually represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with N nodes including two input nodes, several intermediate nodes and a single output node. Each node is a latent representation denoted as x (i) , where i is its topological order in the DAG. Each directed edge (i, j) in the DAG is associated with an operation o (i,j) that transfers the information from node x (i) to node x (j) . In Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and its variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, the optimal architecture is derived from a discrete search space by relaxing the selection of operations to a continuous optimization problem. During the search phase, the operation of each edge is parameterized by architectural parameters α (i,j) as a softmax mixture over all the possible operations within the operation space</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O, i.e. o (i,j) (x (i) ) = o∈O exp(α (i,j) o ) o ∈O exp(α (i,j) o )</formula><p>o(x (i) ). The input nodes are represented by the outputs from the previous two cells. Each intermediate node aggregates information flows from all of its predecessors, x (j) = i&lt;jō (i,j) (x (i) ). The output node is defined as a concatenation of a fixed number of its predecessors. The learning procedure of architectural parameters involves a bi-level optimization problem: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min A L val (W * (A), A)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">s.t. W * (A) = argmin W L train (W, A)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">i † , j † ) by replacingō (i † ,j † ) with o (i † ,j † ) = argmax o∈O α (i † ,j † ) o .</formula><p>The corresponding architectural parameter α (i † ,j † ) will be removed from the bi-level optimization. Operations which were not chosen in a mixture operation will be pruned. At the end of the search phase, a stand-alone architecture without weight sharing will be obtained.</p><p>L train and L val denote the training and validation loss respectively. Owing to the continuous relaxation, the search is realized by optimizing a supernet. W is the set of weights of the supernet and A is the set of the architectural parameters. DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed to solve this bi-level problem by a first/second order approximation. At the end of the search, the final architecture is derived by selecting the operation with highest weight for every mixture operation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">o (i,j) = argmax o∈O α (i,j) o .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Search-Evaluation Correlation</head><p>A popular pipeline of existing NAS algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> includes two stages: a search phase and an evaluation phase. In order to reduce computational overhead, previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> first search over a pre-defined search space with a lightweight proxy model on a small proxy dataset. After the best architecture cell/encoding is obtained, the final architecture is built and trained from scratch on the target dataset. This requires that the true performance during evaluation can be inferred during the search phase. However, this assumption usually does not hold due to the discrepancy in dataset, hyper-parameters and network architectures between the search and evaluation phases. The best ranking derived from the search phase does not imply the actual ranking in the final evaluation. In practice, the correlation between the performances of derived architectures during the search and evaluation phases is usually low. In this paper, we refer to this issue as degenerate search-evaluation correlation. Recent work by Sciuto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> also analyzes this issue and suggests that the Kendall τ metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> could be used to evaluate the search phase. They show that the widely used weight sharing technique actually decreases the correlation. The Kendall τ metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a common measurement of the correlation between two rankings. The Kendall τ coefficient can be computed as τ = Nc−N d 1 2 n(n−1) , where N c and N d are the number of concordant pairs and the number of discordant pairs respectively. It is a number in the range from −1 to 1 where −1 corresponds to a perfect negative correlation and 1 to a perfect positive correlation. If the Kendall τ coefficient is 0, the rankings are completely independent. An ideal NAS method should have a high search-evaluation Kendall τ coefficient. We take DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> as an example and show its Kendall τ in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. It is calculated between the rankings during search phase and evaluation phase. The rankings are determined according to the validation accuracy and the final evaluation accuracy after 10 different runs on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The Kendall τ coefficients for DARTS are only 0.16 and −0.29 for the 1st-order and 2nd-order versions respectively. Therefore, it is impossible to make reliable predictions regarding the final test accuracy based on the search phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Sequential Greedy Architecture Search</head><p>In order to alleviate the degenerate search-evaluation correlation problem, the core aspects are to reduce (1) the discrepancy between the search and evaluation phases and (2) the negative effect of weight sharing. We propose to solve the bi-level optimization (Equation 1, 2) in a sequential greedy fashion to reduce the model discrepancy and the weight sharing progressively. As mentioned in Section 3.1, DARTS-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> solve the relaxed problem fully and obtain all the selected operations at the end. Instead of solving the complete problem directly, we divide it into sub-problems and solve them sequentially with a greedy algorithm. The sub-problems are defined based on the directed edges in the DAG. We pick the operation </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(i † ,j † ) with o (i † ,j † ) = argmax o∈O α (i † ,j † ) o</formula><p>Prune unchosen weights from W, Remove α (i † ,j † ) from A Derive the final architecture based on chosen operations for edges greedily in a sequential manner and solve the remaining sub-problem iteratively. The iterative procedure is shown in Algorithm 1. At each decision epoch, we choose one edge (i † , j † ) according to a pre-defined selection criterion. A greedy optimal choice is made for the selected edge by replacing the corresponding mixture operationō</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(i † ,j † ) with o (i † ,j † ) = argmax o∈O α (i † ,j † ) o</formula><p>. The architectural parameters α (i † ,j † ) and the weights of the remaining paths within the mixture operations are no longer needed; we prune and exclude them from the latter optimization. As a side benefit, the efficiency improves as parameters in A and W are pruned gradually in the optimization loop. The search procedure of the remaining A and W forms a new sub-problem which will be solved iteratively. At the end of the search phase, a stand-alone network without weight sharing is obtained, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Therefore, the model discrepancy is minimized and the validation accuracy during the search phase reflects the final evaluation accuracy much better. To maintain the optimality, the design of the selection criterion is crucial. We consider three aspects of edges which are the edge importance, the selection certainty and the selection stability.</p><p>Edge Importance. Similar to DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, a zero operation is included in the search space to indicate a lack of connection. Edges that are important should have a low weight in the zero operation. Thus, the edge importance is defined as the summation of weights over non-zero operations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S (i,j) EI = o∈O,o =zero exp(α (i,j) o ) o ∈O exp(α (i,j) o ) (3)</formula><p>Selection Certainty. Entropy is a common measurement of uncertainty of a distribution. The normalized softmax weights of non-zero operations can be regarded as a distribution, p</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(i,j) o = exp(α (i,j) o ) S (i,j) EI o ∈O exp(α (i,j) o ) , o ∈ O, o = zero.</formula><p>We define the selection certainty as the complement of the normalized entropy of the operation distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S (i,j) SC = 1 − − o∈O,o =zero p (i,j) o log(p (i,j) o ) log(|O| − 1)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Selection Stability. In order to incorporate the history information, we measure the movement of the operation distribution. KullbackLeibler divergence and histogram intersection <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> are two popular methods to detect changes in distribution. For simplicity, we choose the latter one. The average selection stability at step T with a history window size K is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S (i,j) SS = 1 K T −1 t=T −K ot∈Oot, =zero min(p (i,j) ot , p (i,j) o T ) (5)</formula><p>In our experiments, we consider the following two criteria:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Criterion 1. An edge (i † , j † ) with a high edge importance S (i,j)</formula><p>EI and a high selection certainty S (i,j) SC will be selected. We normalize S (i,j) EI and S (i,j) SC , compute the final score and pick the edge with the highest score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">S (i,j) 1 = normalize(S (i,j) EI ) * normalize(S (i,j) SC ) (6)</formula><p>Criterion 2. In addition to Criterion 1, we also consider that the selected edge (i † , j † ) should have a high selection stability. The final score is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S (i,j) 2 = S (i,j) 1 * normalize(S (i,j) SS )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where normalize(·) denotes a standard Min-Max scaling normalization. For a fair comparison with existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, two incoming edges are preserved for every intermediate node in the DAG. Once a node has two determined incoming edges, its other incoming edges will be pruned. We refer to our method as Sequential Greedy Architecture Search (SGAS). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that SGAS with Criterion 1 and 2 improves the Kendall τ correlation coefficients to 0.56 and 0.42 respectively. As expected from the much higher search-evaluation correlation SGAS outperform DARTS in terms of average accuracy significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>We use our SGAS to automatically find architectures for both CNNs and GCNs. The CNN architectures discovered by SGAS outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in image classification on CIFAR-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Similarly, the discovered GCN architectures outperform the state-of-the-art methods for point cloud classification on ModelNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and node classification in biological graphs using the PPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Architecture Search on CIFAR-10</head><p>As is common practice, we first search for normal cells and reduction cells with a small network for image classification on CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10 is a small popular dataset containing 50K training images and 10K testing images. Then, a larger network is constructed by making necessary changes in channel size and stacking the searched cells multiple times. The larger network is retrained on CIFAR-10 to compare its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show the transferability of our SGAS by stacking even more cells and evaluating on ImageNet. We show that SGAS consistently achieves the top performance.</p><p>Search Space. We keep our search space the same as DARTS, which has 8 candidate operations: skip-connect, max-pool-3×3, avg-pool-3×3, sep-conv-3×3, sep-conv-5×5, dil-conv-3×3, dil-conv-5×5, zero. During the search phase, we stack 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells to form a network. Two reduction cells are inserted at a network depth of 1/3 and 2/3 respectively. The stride of each convolution in normal cells is 1, so the spatial size of an input feature map does not change. In reduction cells, convolutions with stride 2 are used to reduce the spatial resolution of feature maps. There are 7 nodes with 4 intermediate nodes and 14 edges in each cell during search. The first and second input nodes of the cell are set equal to the outputs of the two previous cells respectively. The output node of a cell is the depth-wise concatenation of all the intermediate nodes.</p><p>Training Settings. We keep the training setting the same as in DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. A small network consisting of 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells with an initial channel size 16 is trained on CIFAR-10. We perform architecture search for 50 epochs with a batch size of 64. SGD is used to optimize the model weights W with an initial learning rate 0.025, momentum 0.9 and weight decay 3 × 10 −4 . For architecture parameters A, the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate 3 × 10 −4 , momentum (0.5, 0.999) and weight decay 10 −3 is used. Instead of training the entire supernet throughout the search phase, SGAS makes decisions sequentially in a greedy fashion. After warming up for 9 epochs, SGAS begins to select one operation for one se-lected edge every 5 epochs using Criterion 1 or Criterion 2 as the selection criterion. For Criterion 2, we set the history window size K to 4. The batch size is increased by 8 after each greedy decision, which further boosts the searching efficiency of SGAS. We provide a thorough discussion and ablation study on the choices of hyper-parameters in the supplement material. The search takes only 0.25 day (6 hours) on a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Architecture Evaluation on CIFAR-10</head><p>We run 10 independent searches to get 10 architectures with Criterion 1 or Criterion 2, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. To highlight the stability of the search method, we evaluate the discovered architectures on CIFAR-10 and report the mean and standard deviation of the test accuracy across those 10 models and the performance of the best model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. It is important to mention that other related works in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> only report the mean and standard deviation for their best architecture with different runs on evaluation. Training Settings. We train a large network of 20 cells with a initial channel size 36. The SGD optimizer is used during 600 epochs with a batch size of 96. The other hyperparameters remain the same as the search phase. Cutout with length 16, auxiliary towers with weight 0.4 and path dropout with probability 0.3 are used as in DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Evaluation Results and Analysis. We compare our results with other methods in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and report the average and best performance for both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

However, this hand-crafted architecture design requires adequate effort by an human expert. The main component of DeepGCNs is the GCN backbone. We explore an automatic way to design the GCN backbone using SGAS. Our backbone network is formed by stacking the graph convolutional cell discovered by SGAS. Our GCN cell consists of 6 nodes. We use fixed 1 × 1 convolutions in the first two nodes, and set the input to them equal to the output from the previous two layers. Our experiments on GCNs have two stages. First, we apply SGAS to search for the graph convolutional cell using a small dataset and obtain 10 architectures from 10 runs. Then, 10 larger networks are constructed by stacking each discovered cell multiple times. The larger networks are trained on the same dataset or a larger one to evaluate their performance. We report the best and average performance of these 10 architectures. We show the effectiveness of SGAS in GCN architecture search by comparisons with SOTA hand-crafted methods and Random Search.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we propose the Sequential Greedy Architectural Search (SGAS) algorithm to design architectures automatically for CNNs and GCNs. The bi-level optimization problem in NAS is solved in a greedy fashion using heuristic criteria which take the edge importance, the selection certainty and the selection stability into consideration. Such an approach alleviates the effect of the degenerate search-evaluation correlation problem and reflects the true ranking of architectures. As a result, architectures discovered by SGAS achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, ModelNet and PPI datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGAS: Sequential Greedy Architecture Search -Supplementary Material -</head><p>A. Discussion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Greedy Methods in NAS</head><p>The idea of incorporating greedy algorithms into NAS has been explored in several works. PNAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposes a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) approach to accelerate the search for CNN architectures. They start from a simple search space and a learn a predictor function. Then they greedily grow the search space by predicting scores of candidates cells using the learned predictor function. GNAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> learns a global tree-like architecture for multi-attribute learning by iteratively updating layer-wise local architectures in a greedy manner. P-DARTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> can also be regarded as a greedy approach, in which they bridge the depth gap between search and evaluation by gradually increasing the depth of the search networks while shrinking the number of candidate operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Selection Criteria and Hyper-parameters</head><p>Edge Importance and Selection Certainty. Edge importance and selection certainty are combined into a single criterion, since the algorithm will be agnostic to the selection distribution of an edge, if we only consider edge importance. In this case, an edge may be selected with a suboptimal operation at early epochs. On the other hand, we need to select 8 out of 14 edges in a DAG with 4 intermediate nodes for a fair comparison with DARTS. Only considering selection certainty may fail to select the optimal 8 edges, since an edge with a high selection certainty may have a high weight on Zero operation (low edge importance).</p><p>Choices of Hyper-parameters. Three extra parameters are introduced in SGAS: (1) length of warm-up phase (2) interval of greedy decisions (3) history window size for Cri.2. We provide a discussion on the default choices of them:</p><p>(1) Since the softmax weights of operations are initialized under a uniform distribution, choosing an operation for an edge after a short period of warming up leads to stable results. We simply set the length of the warm-up phase to 9 epochs so that the first greedy decision will be made at the 10th epoch. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> For CNN experiments, the interval between greedy decisions is chosen to be 5. Since designing a normal cell with 4 intermediate nodes needs to select 8 out of 14 edges (8 decisions to be made). For a fair comparison to our baseline DARTS, we want the search phase to last up to 50 epochs, which is the length of search epochs in DARTS. For GCN architectures, in order to learn a compact network, we search a normal cell with 3 intermediate nodes.</p><p>Thus, we have 6 decisions to make (6 out of 9 edges). Similarly, to keep the length of the search phase less than 50 epochs, we set the interval between greedy decisions to be 7.</p><p>(3) The history window size for Cri.2 is always set as 4, which is simply chosen to be slightly smaller than the interval between greedy decisions.</p><p>Ablation Study on Hyper-parameters. In order to better understand the effects of the choices of hyper-parameters, we conduct ablation studies on interval of greedy decisions T and history window size K for Cri.2 on CIFAR-10 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. The default values of T and K are 5 and 4 respectively. We find that larger T and K stabilize the search and produce standard deviations in the test error. The test error only has a standard deviation as 0.08 when T = 7. When T = 3, the average test error increases significantly from 2.67% to 2.86%. We also find K is less sensitive than T .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> which combines the ideas from MR-Conv <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Instead of aggregating the node features with its neighbor features directly, we aggregate the node features with the difference between the node features and its neighbor features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h (k) v = σ W (k) · f k h (k−1) v , h (k−1) u − h (k−1) v , ∀u ∈ N (v) where h (k) v</formula><p>is the feature of the center node v in k-th layer. N (v) denotes the neighbors of node v. f k is a max aggregation function and σ is a ReLU activation function as GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The GCNs operators are implemented using Pytorch Geometric <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We also add skip-connect (similar as residual graph connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>) and zero operation in our search space. Ablation Study on GCN Cells. We conduct an ablation study on the parameter size of the best cell searched on PPI by SGAS (Cri.1 best). <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the trade-off between the parameter size and the final performance. To derive a compact model, we can use a smaller number of cells or less channels in the architecture searched by SGAS.  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>.
