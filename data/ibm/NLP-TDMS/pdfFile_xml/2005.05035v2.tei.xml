<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A knowledge base (KB) is a collection of triples <ref type="bibr">(s, r, o)</ref>, with a subject s, a relation type r and an object o. KBs are usually incomplete, necessitating completion (KBC), i.e., inferring facts not provided in the KB. A KBC model is often evaluated via link prediction: supplying missing arguments to queries of the form (s, r, ?) and <ref type="bibr">(?, r, o)</ref>.</p><p>Many relations are transient or impermanent. Temporal KBs annotate each fact (event) with the time period (instant) in which it holds (occurs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hoffart et al., 2013)</ref>. A person is born in a city in an instant, a politician can be a country's president for several years, and a marriage may last between years and decades. Temporal KBs represent these by (s, r, o, T ) tuples, where T is a span of time. * Equal contribution Temporal KBC (TKBC) performs completion of temporal KBs. It is also primarily evaluated by link prediction queries (s, r, ?, T ) and <ref type="bibr">(?, r, o, T )</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Recently, time prediction (s, r, o, ?)</ref> has also been considered for predicting time instants, but not time intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lacroix et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>While KBC has been intensely researched, TKBC is only beginning to be explored. TKBC presents novel challenges in task definition and modeling. For instance, little is known about how best to predict intervals for (s, r, o, ?) queries, or how to evaluate a system response interval. Moreover, we show that even for link prediction queries, evaluation faces subtle complications owing to the inclusion of T in (s, r, ?, T ) queries and requires careful rethinking of evaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose improved evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks in a TKBC.</p><p>TKBC also brings unique modeling opportunities. A TKBC system can learn typical durations of relation validity, or distributions over time gaps between events, from training data. E.g., a person must be born before becoming president, which must precede death. A nation rarely has two presidents at the same time. Such constraints can better inform both link and time predictions.</p><p>In response, we present TIMEPLEX, a novel TKBC model, which obtains state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets for both link and time prediction. At a high level, TIMEPLEX performs tensor factorization of a temporal KB, using complexvalued embeddings for relations, entities and time points. It enables these embeddings to capture implicit temporal relationships across facts and relations, by providing temporal differences as explicit features. Our contributions are summarized as: • We propose evaluation protocols for link and time interval prediction queries for TKBC. For link prediction, we highlight that existing evaluations seriously over/under-estimate system performance, and offer a time-aware filtering method for more reliable evaluation. For time interval prediction, we propose an evaluation metric that rewards a model for predicting an interval with partial overlap with gold interval, as well as for nearness to gold in case of no overlap. • We present TIMEPLEX, a TKBC model that factorizes a temporal KB using entity, relation and time embeddings. It can learn and exploit soft ordering and span constraints between potentially all relation pairs (including that of a relation with itself). It beats recent and competitive models on several recent standard TKBC data sets. We will release an open-source implementation 1 of all models and experiments discussed here.</p><p>2 Preliminaries and Prior Work 2.1 Time-Agnostic KBC Time-agnostic KBC has been intensely researched <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bordes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Yang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nickel et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jain et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lacroix et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jain et al., 2018b)</ref>. A common approach is to score an (s, r, o) triple as a function over jointly learned entity and relation embeddings. The models are trained using loss functions imposing -scores for known triples should be higher than (randomly sampled) negative triples.</p><p>Our work is based on ComplEx <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Trouillon et al., 2016)</ref>, abbreviated as CX. It embeds s, r, o to vectors of complex space s, r, o ∈ C D . CX defines the score φ of a fact (s, r, o) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Re( s, r, o ) where s, r, o = D d=1 s[d] r[d] o [d]</formula><p>(1) is a 3-way inner product, o is the complex conjugate of o, and Re(c) is real part of c ∈ C. If real embeddings are used instead, the above formula reduces to DistMult <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yang et al., 2015)</ref>. We choose CX as our base model, because it is competitive with recent KBC models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ruffinelli et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Temporal KBC Problem Setup</head><p>A temporal KB associates the validity of a triple (s, r, o) with one or more time intervals T ⊆ T, where T is the domain of "all time". Each interval T is represented as [t b , t e ], with begin and end time instants. Some event-style facts (e.g., born in) may have t b = t e . For simplicity, we assume that T is discretized to a suitable granularity and is represented by a set of integers. Temporal KB facts have the form (s, r, o, T ), and are partitioned into train, 1 github.com/dair-iitd/tkbi dev and eval (test) folds, abbreviated as tr, de, ev. System predictions are abbreviated as pr.</p><p>Given the train and dev folds, our goal is to learn a model that scores any unseen fact. A system is evaluated via link prediction queries (?, r, o, T ) and (s, r, ?, T ), and time interval prediction queries <ref type="bibr">(s, r, o, ?)</ref>. In our setting, KB incompleteness exists at all times -the eval fold may include instances from any interval in time, arbitrarily overlapping train and dev fold instances. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Recent TKBC Systems</head><p>Recent work adopts a common style for extending φ(s, r, o) to temporal score φ(s, r, o, t). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lacroix et al. (2020)</ref> embed each time instant t to vector t and use the form s, r, o , t (called TNT-ComplEx). This can be interpreted as any one of s, r, o becoming t-dependent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goel et al. (2020)</ref> make both subject and object embeddings time-dependent; the 'diachronic' embedding e ∈ R D of entity e is characterized by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e t [d] = a e [d] sin(w e [d] t + b e [d])</formula><p>, where d ∈ D and the sinusoidal nonlinearity affords the capacity to switch "entity features" on and off with time t. HyTE (Dasgupta et al., 2018) models t ∈ R D , t 2 = 1 and project all of s, r, o on to t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x ↓ t = x − (x · t)t, where x ∈ {s, r, o}.</formula><p>In all cases, time-dependent entity embeddings are plugged into standard scoring functions like <ref type="bibr">Dist-Mult, CX, or SimplE (Kazemi and Poole, 2018)</ref>. A very different approach  encodes the string representation of relation and time with an LSTM, which is used in TransE (TA-TransE) or DistMult (TA-DM).</p><p>These formulations do not directly model recurrences of a relation or interactions (e.g., mutual exclusion) between relations. There is some prior work on explicitly providing ordering constraints between relations (e.g., born, married, died) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jiang et al., 2016)</ref>. In contrast, TIMEPLEX assumes no such additional engineered inputs; it has explicit components to enable learning of temporal (soft) constraints, as model weights, jointly with embeddings of entities, relations, and time instants. Such constraint based reasoning has also been exploited (in a limited way) for a different task, namely, temporal question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jia et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Standard Evaluation Schemes</head><p>Link Prediction: Link prediction queries in KBC are of the form (s, r, ?) with a gold response o ev . Similarly, for TKBC they are of the form (s, r, ?, T ). The cases of (?, r, o) and (?, r, o, T ) are symmetric and receive analogous treatment. Link prediction performance is evaluated by finding the rank of o ev in the list of all entities ordered by decreasing score φ assigned by the model, and computing MRR. Other measures include the fraction of queries where o ev is recalled within the top 1 or top 10 ranked predictions (HITS@1 and HITS@10).</p><p>A query may have multiple correct answers. A model must not be penalized for ranking a different correct entity over o ev . In KBC this is achieved by filtering out all correct entities above o ev in ranked list before computing the metrics. In TKBC, filtering requires additional care, as depicted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. We develop time-aware filtering in Section 3.2.</p><p>Time Prediction: Time prediction queries of the form (s, r, o, ?) will require comparing a gold time</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">interval T ev = [t ev b , t ev e ] with a predicted interval T pr = [t pr b , t pr e ].</formula><p>Since this is an understudied task, evaluation metrics have not yet been standardized. One might adapt the TAC metric popular in Temporal Slot Filling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ji et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Surdeanu, 2013)</ref>. Adapted to TKBC, TAC 3 will compute a score as 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">2 1 1+|t ev b −t pr b | + 1 1+|t ev e −t pr e | .</formula><p>Unfortunately, TAC score is not entirely satisfactory for this task. For instance, TAC will assign the same merit score when gold interval <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref> is compared with predicted interval <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref>, versus when gold <ref type="bibr">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref> is compared with prediction <ref type="bibr">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr">195]</ref>. However, a human would judge the latter more favorably, because a 5minute delay in a 10-minute trip would usually be considered more serious than in a 100-minute journey. In response, we investigate alternative evaluation metrics inspired by bounding box evaluation protocols from Computer Vision, in Section 3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation Metrics and Filtering</head><p>The preceding discussion motivates why we need clearly-thought-out filtering and evaluation schemes, not only for time interval prediction queries, but also because time affects link prediction evaluation in subtle but fundamental ways. This section addresses both issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Time Interval Prediction</head><p>One possible way to evaluate time prediction is to adapt measures to compare bounding boxes in computer vision, e.g., Intersection Over Union (IOU):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">IOU(T ev , T pr ) = vol(T ev ∩T pr ) vol(T ev ∪T pr ) ∈ [0, 1],</formula><p>where vol for our case simply refers to the size of the interval. Unfortunately, IOU loses discrimination once T ev ∩ T pr = ∅; e.g., IOU([1, 2], [3, 4]) = IOU([1, 2], [30, 40]) = 0. This has been noticed recently in computer vision also, and a metric called gIOU been introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rezatofighi et al., 2019)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">gIOU(T ev , T pr ) = IOU(T ev , T pr )− vol((T ev T pr ) \ (T ev ∪ T pr )) vol(T ev T pr ) ∈ (−1, 1]. (2)</formula><p>T ev T pr is the smallest single contiguous interval (hull) containing all of T ev and T pr . E.g., <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref> [30, 40] = <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">40]</ref>.</p><p>gIOU can be negative, which is not ideal for a performance metric that is aggregated over instances. A simple fix (gIOU ) is to scale it to [0,1] via (gIOU + 1)/2, but we notice that the tiniest overlap between T ev and T pr yields gIOU to be at least half, regardless of vol(T ev ) or vol(T pr ). In response, we propose a novel affinity enhanced IOU:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">aeIOU(T ev , T pr ) = max{1, vol(T ev ∩ T pr )} vol(T ev T pr )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>When T ev ∩ T pr = ∅, the denominator includes "wasted time", reducing aeIOU. The '1' in the numerator represents the smallest granularity of time in the data (see Section 2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of Evaluation Metrics:</head><p>A good time interval prediction metric (M ) must satisfy the property (P ) that: if two predicted intervals have intersections of the same size (possibly zero) with the gold interval, then the prediction that has a smaller hull with the gold interval should be scored higher by M . Formally, let T pr 1 and T pr 2 be two predictions made for T ev .</p><p>Property P: Let vol(T ev ∩T pr 1 ) = vol(T ev ∩T pr 2 ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Then, M (T ev , T pr 1 ) &gt; M (T ev , T pr 2 ) if and only if vol(T ev T pr 1 ) &lt; vol(T ev T pr 2 ).</formula><p>Theorem: IOU and gIOU do not satisfy property P, whereas aeIOU satisfies it.</p><p>The proof for the theorem is in Appendix B. This suggests that aeIOU is a more defensible metric for our task, compared to other alternatives.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 0 0 0 0 0 Jean - - - - - - - Time-sensitive rank of Jean 1+4=5 1+0=1 1+3=4 1+3=4 1+2=3 1+1=2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Link Prediction</head><p>We first illustrate the unique challenges offered by TKBC link prediction queries through an example in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The query asks for the name of a person who was a member of the French National Assembly in interval <ref type="bibr">[2000,</ref><ref type="bibr">2003]</ref>.</p><p>Let the gold answer (object) o ev be Jean, which is ranked at the fifth position by the model. All four entities above Jean are seen with the same subject and relation in the data, but for different time intervals. E.g., Pierre is also a member of the assembly, but during <ref type="bibr">[2002,</ref><ref type="bibr">2003]</ref>.</p><p>The key question is: how should the four entities above Jean be filtered to compute its final rank?</p><p>We argue <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>  For instance, the model is not penalized for predicting Alain, even though its membership interval has no overlap with the query interval. Ideally, filtering must account for the overlap between the query time interval and the time intervals associated with system-proposed entities. We propose such a filtering strategy (Method 3). We split the query interval into time instants, and compute a filtered rank for each time point independently.</p><p>Entities that have full time overlap (or no overlap) will always (respectively, never) get filtered for a time instant. Partially overlapping entities will get filtered in only overlapping instants (e.g., 2 out of 4 for Pierre). After computing filtered ranks for each time instant, we output the final rank as an average of all such filtered ranks. In this example, this approach will compute the average of {4, 4, 3, 2}, which is 3.25. This average rank is used when computing standard metrics like MRR and HITS@10. Note that the run-time complexity of the proposed evaluation protocol is linear in the size of interval, because we compute a filtered rank for each time point separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Proposed TIMEPLEX Framework</head><p>Similar to TNT-Complex, TIMEPLEX learns complex-valued entity, relation, and time instant embeddings. However, it has several differences from TNT-Complex. (1) Its base scoring function φ T X (s, r, o, t) adds several products of three embeddings, instead of a single four-way product (Section 4.1). (2) It has a fully automatic mechanism to introduce additional features to capture recurrent nature of a relation, as well as temporal interactions between pairs of relations (Section 4.2). (3) It uses a two-phase training (Section 4.3) curriculum that estimates first the embeddings and then novel additional parameters. (4) Its testing protocol can output a missing time-interval T for time-interval prediction queries (Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">TIMEPLEX Base Model</head><p>Just as a joint distribution is often approximated using lower-order marginals in graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Koller and Friedman, 2009</ref>), TIMEPLEX constructs a base score (φ T X ) by augmenting CX score with three time-dependent terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">φ T X (s, r, o, t) = s, r SO , o + α s, r ST , t + β o, r OT , t + γ s, o, t . (4)</formula><p>Here, s, o, t ∈ C D , whereas each r is represented as a collection of three such vectors (r SO , r ST , r OT ), and hence requires three times the parameters. r ST represents a relation which is true for entity s at time t (similarly for r SO and r OT ). α, β and γ are hyperparameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang et al. (2016)</ref> observed that several relations attach to a subject or object only at specific time points. E.g., subject Barack Obama was president in 2009, regardless of the object United States. In such cases, the formulation above is fully expressive. To extend from single time instants t to an interval T , we propose</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">φ T X (s, r, o, T ) = t∈T φ T X (s, r, o, t). (5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relation Recurrence and Pair Scores</head><p>We extend TIMEPLEX's base model via additional (soft) temporal constraints that can help in better assessing the validity of a tuple. We aim to capture three types of temporal constraints: Relation Recurrence: Many relations do not recur for a given entity (e.g., a person is born only once). Some relations recur with fixed periodicity (e.g., Olympic games recur every four years).</p><p>Recurrences of other relations may be distributed around a mean time period. Ordering Between Relations: A relation precedes another, for a given entity. E.g., person-BornYear should precede personDiedYear for a given subject entity (person). Time Gaps Between Relations: The difference in time instants of two relations (wrt to an entity) is distributed around a mean, e.g., person-DiedYear minus personBornYear has a mean of about 70 with some observed variance. The first constraint concerns a single relation, whereas the latter two concern pairs of relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang et al. (2016)</ref> attempted to capture relation ordering constraints as model regularization, but their approach does not take into account time differences. Nor does it model relation recurrence. Basic TIMEPLEX may not be able to learn these constraints from data either, since each time instant is modeled as a separate embedding with independent parameters -it has no explicit understanding of the difference between two time instants. In response, we augment TIMEPLEX with additional features that capture how soon an event recurs, or how soon after the occurrence of one relation, another relation is likely to follow. We define two scoring functions φ Rec and φ Pair for these two cases, to be aggregated with φ T X (eqn. 4).</p><p>Inspired by García-Durán and Niepert <ref type="formula">(2018)</ref>, we model time gaps as drawn from Gaussian distributions. We use N (x|µ, σ) to denote the probability density of a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and std deviation σ at the time (difference) value x (See <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (a)</ref>). We denote as KB tr all tuples in the train fold.</p><p>Recurrence Score: We say that (s, r, o) recurs if there are at least two distinct intervals T such that (s, r, o, T ) ∈ KB tr . If there are at least K Rec distinct pairs (s, o) such that (s, r, o) recurs, then r is considered recurrent. K Rec is a hyperparameter.</p><p>For each recurrent relation r, our model learns three new parameters: µ r , σ r , and b r . Intuitively, N (·|µ r , σ r ) represents a distribution of typical durations between two recurring instances of a relation (with a specific subject and object entity) and b r is the bias term. Relation Pairs Score: TIMEPLEX also learns soft time constraints between pairs of relations. We describe this mechanism for subjects; objects are handled analogously. For each relation pair (r, r ), we maintain four parameters, µ rr , σ rr , b rr and w rr , whose purpose we will describe presently. As with recurrence scores, all training tuples (s, r, o, T ) are reduced to (s, r, o, t), where t = t b , the start time of T . Given the candidate tuple (s, r, o, t) to score, we collect fact tuples</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">{f i = (s, r i , o i , t i ) ∈ KB tr , r i = r}, (8) sc(f i ) = N (t − t i |µ rr i , σ rr i ) + b rr i having the same subject but a different relation, into the set called KB Pair (s). The i th tuple in KB Pair (s) is scored as sc(f i ) = N (t − t i |µ rr i , σ rr i ) + b rr i .</formula><p>This represents the contribution of f i in the validity of candidate tuple, based on their (signed) time difference, and typical time differences observed between these two relations. φ Pair sub needs to aggregate these over f i . The (trained) parameter w rr measures how much the times associated with r influence our belief in (s, r, o, t). Using these, we define the weighted average</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">φ Pair sub (s, r, o, t) = f i ∈KB Pair (s) sc(f i ) exp(w rr i ) f j exp(w rr j )</formula><p>.</p><p>A similar φ Pair obj score is computed for the object entity, and overall φ Pair = φ Pair sub + φ Pair obj (See <ref type="figure">Figure 1 (b)</ref>). The final scoring function of TIME- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Training</head><p>We train TIMEPLEX in a curriculum of two phases. In the first phase, we optimize embeddings for all entities, relations and time-instants by minimizing the log-likelihood loss using only the base model TX. We compute the probability of predict-ing a response o for a query (s, r, ?, T ) as: + log Pr(t|s, r, o; θ) (11) In the second phase, we freeze all embeddings and train the parameters of the recurrence and pairs models. Here, too, we use the log-likelihood loss, except that φ T X is replaced by the overall φ function. Parameters µ rr and σ rr of the relation-pairs model component are not trained via backpropagation. Instead, they are fitted separately, using the difference distributions for the pair of relations in the training KB. This improves the overall stability of training.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pr(o|s, r, T ) = exp(φ T X (s, r, o, T )) o exp(φ T X (s, r, o , T ))<label>(10)</label></formula></div>

For time prediction, its goal is to output a predicted time duration T pr . We first compute a probability distribution over time instants Pr(t|s, r, o) = exp(φ(s,r,o,t)) t ∈T exp(φ(s,r,o,t )) . We then greedily coalesce time instants to output the best duration. For greedy coalescing, we tune a threshold parameter θ r for each relation r using the dev fold (such that shorter θ r prefers short duration and vice versa). We then initialize the predicted interval T pr as argmax t <ref type="figure">Pr(t|s, r, o)</ref>. Then, as long as total probability of the interval, i.e., t∈T pr Pr(t|s, r, o) is less than θ r , we extend T pr with the instant to its left or right, whichever has a higher probability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Datasets &amp; Experimental Setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Datasets:</head><p>We report on experiments with four standard TKBC datasets. WIKIDATA12k and YAGO11k (Dasgupta et al., 2018) are two knowledge graphs with a time interval associated with each triple. These contain relational facts like (David Beckham, plays for, Manchester United; <ref type="bibr">[1992,</ref><ref type="bibr">2003]</ref>). ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 (García-Durán et al., 2018) are two event-based temporal knowledge graphs, with facts from Integrated Crisis Early Warning System repository. These primarily include political events with timestamps (no nontrivial intervals). We consider the time granularity for interval datasets as 1 year, and for ICEWS datasets as 1 day. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref> in Appendix A for salient statistics of these datasets. By experimenting across the spectrum, from 'point' events to facts with duration, we wish to ensure the robustness of our observations. García-Durán et al. (2018) also report performance on the Yago15k dataset. However, for this dataset, only 17% of the facts have associated temporal information. In contrast, all the datasets we used had at least 99% of facts with temporal information. Hence, we believe a temporal model will not substantially improve the performance of a time-agnostic model on this dataset. Note that TNT-Complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lacroix et al., 2020</ref>) also obtained only a slight improvement over a time-agnostic model on Yago15k, supporting our hypothesis. A contemporaneous work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahrabian et al., 2020)</ref> proposed new multi-relational temporal Knowledge Graph based on the daily interactions between artifacts in GitHub. We leave exploration of this dataset for future work.</p><p>Algorithms compared: We compare against our reimplementations of CX, HyTE, TA-family, and TNT-Complex. In all cases we verify that our implementations give comparable or better scores as reported in literature. We combine HyTE and TA, with scoring functions from TransE, DistMult and CX and present the best results. We also compare against reported results in DE-SimplE.</p><p>Experimental Details: For all models, we optimize parameters with AdaGrad running for 500 epochs for all losses, with early stopping on dev fold. We control for an approximately comparable number of parameters and set dimensionality of 200 for all complex embeddings and 400 for all real embeddings. We follow other best practices in the literature, such as L2 regularization only on embeddings used in the current batch <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Trouillon et al., 2016)</ref>, adding inverted facts (o, r −1 , s, T ) , using 1vsAll negative sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Dettmers et al., 2018)</ref> whenever applicable, and using temporal smoothing for ICEWS datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lacroix et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Some instances in interval datasets have t b or t e missing. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dasgupta et al. (2018)</ref>, we replace missing values by −∞ or +∞, respectively. For time prediction queries, we remove such instances from test sets. For ICEWS datasets we set t b = t e . For time interval prediction, all models use our greedy coalescing inference from Section 4.4.</p><p>For TIMEPLEX, we perform a grid search for all hyperparameters, and pick the best values based on MRR scores on valiations set. Hyperparameters for all datasets are described in Appendix G.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results and Observations</head><p>We are the first to look at the task of predicting time intervals, and we report performance using our novel aeIOU metric <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3)</ref>. We see that TIMEPLEX outperforms TNT-Complex on both datasets, with a huge 11+ pt jump on the Yago11K dataset. It is also noteworthy that even the base model of TIMEPLEX is consistently better than TNT-Complex across all experiments.</p><p>On Pair/recurrent features: We find that recurrent features are very helpful in both interval datasets, and significantly improve link prediction performance. Relation pair features particularly help in YAGO11k -over 5 pt aeIOU boost in time prediction, but on WIKIDATA12k they make only a marginal difference. On inspecting the datasets, we find that 78% of entities in WIKIDATA12k are seen with a single, recurring relation (such as award received, or member of sports team); therefore, relation pair features cannot help.</p><p>ICEWS datasets are scraped from news events. On inspecting the datasets, we find that the events do not follow any temporal ordering and are fairly non-regular in event recurrence as well. Hence, TIMEPLEX's improvements over the base model are limited. We further investigate the differing performance on datasets and the value of pair features in the next section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Diagnostics</head><p>Time gap vs. embedding distances: Longevity of relations, or gaps between events, are often determined by physical phenomena that are smooth and continuous in nature. Therefore, we expect the embedding of the year 1904 to be closer to that of 1905 compared to the embedding of, say, 1950.</p><p>To validate this hypothesis, we compute mean L2 distance between embeddings of time instants which are apart by a given time gap. To filter noise, we drop instant pairs with extreme gaps that have low support (less than 30). For WIKIDATA12k we used embeddings of years <ref type="bibr">[1984,</ref><ref type="bibr">2020]</ref> and for YAGO11k we use embeddings of years <ref type="bibr">[1958,</ref><ref type="bibr">2017]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows that L 2 distance between pairs of time embeddings increases with the actual year gap between them. Since we enumerate all time points in the given fact time-interval, years that are closer share a lot of facts (triples), and are hence closer in the embedding space. This has a smoothing effect on time embeddings. Hence they correlate well with actual time-gaps. This strongly suggests that the time embeddings learnt by TIMEPLEX naturally represent physical time.</p><p>Temporal ordering of relation pairs: Both YAGO11k and WIKIDATA12k contain relations with temporal dependencies, e.g., bornInPlace should always precede diedInPlace for the same   person. We now study whether TIMEPLEX models are able to learn these natural constraints from data.</p><p>We first exhaustively extract all relation pairs (r 1 , r 2 ), where the existence of both (s, r 1 , , t 1 ) and (s, r 2 , , t 2 ) is accompanied by t 1 &lt; t 2 at least 99% of the time, with a minimum support of 100 entities s. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We now verify whether TIMEPLEX honors r 1 before r 2 when making predictions.</p><p>For each query <ref type="bibr">(?, r, o, t)</ref> in the test set, we check whether the top model prediction violates any known temporal ordering constraint in this list. For example, for a query <ref type="bibr">(?, hasWonPrize, Nobel Prize, 1925)</ref>, if the model predicted Barack Obama and the KB already had Barack Obama born in Hawaii in 1961, then this will be considered as an ordering violation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref> reports the number such violations as fraction of test set size. TIMEPLEX significantly reduces such errors for YAGO11k; this is also reflected in its superior time prediction performance. For WIKIDATA12k, the errors for TIMEPLEX (base) are already low, hence pair features are not found to be particularly helpful.</p><p>As an illustrative example, we consider the time prediction query (Shinae-ra, wasBornIn, South Korea, ?), with the gold answer 1969. The only other fact seen for Shinae-ra in the train KB is <ref type="bibr">(Shinae-ra, isMarriedTo, ChaIn-Pyo, (1995, -)</ref>). TIMEPLEX predicts 1967 for this query (earning an aeIOU credit of 33.33). However, TNTComplex predicts 2013 (earning almost no credit) -this also highlights that it does not capture commonsense that a <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The list of such relation pairs is given in the Appendix C person can marry only after they are born.</p><p>To understand further, we plot the normalized scores for this query in time range <ref type="bibr">[1850,</ref><ref type="bibr">2010]</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. The peak around 1967 for the TIMEPLEX plot can be attributed to the fact that mean difference for isMarriedTo and wasBornIn relations is around 30 in the dataset. Standard tensor factorization models like TNT-Complex are unable to exploit this, but our Pair features provide a way to the model to make very reasonable predictions. Other similar plots can be found in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>TIMEPLEX cannot exploit the influence that an entity can have on time difference distributions. For example, the life expectancy of a person (mean difference between diedIn and bornIn events) would be around 85 in Japan, but 54 in Lesotho. Extending our model to learn separate parameters for each rel, entity pair may be difficult due to sparsity. Also, recurrent facts may admit exceptions: Winter Olympics are held every 4 years except for 1992 and 1994. However, we do not expect even humans to do well in such cases. Exceptions like these are sparse and difficult to learn, except by rote.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>We presented TIMEPLEX, a new TKBC framework, which combines representations of time with representations of entities and relations. It also learns soft temporal consistency constraints, which allow knowledge of one temporal fact to influence belief in another fact. TIMEPLEX exceeds the performance of existing TKBC systems. Time embeddings are temporally meaningful, and TIMEPLEX makes fewer temporal consistency and ordering mistakes. We also argue that current evaluation schemes for both link and time prediction have limitations, and propose more meaningful schemes. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>aeIOU satisfies P:</head><p>For a fixed vol(T ev ∩ T pr ), we have aeIOU(T ev , T pr ) ∝ 1/vol(T ev T pr ) (see Eqn 3). Hence, aeIOU satisfies property P.</p><p>IoU and gIOU do not satisfy P: IoU: This metric gives 0 score to a model, if model's predicted interval does not intersect with the gold, irrespective of the hull. Hence IoU do not satisfy property P. gIoU: Let us look at the following example. Suppose gold interval is <ref type="bibr">[2002,</ref><ref type="bibr">2005]</ref>, and consider 2 predictions- <ref type="bibr">[1999,</ref><ref type="bibr">2001]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[1900,</ref><ref type="bibr">2001]</ref>. For both predictions, vol((T ev T pr ) \ (T ev ∪ T pr )) is zero, so the hull for the two predictions will be ignored (see Eqn 2), resulting in same scores for both predictions. Hence gIoU does not satisfy property P.</p><p>Model Performance with respect to various time evaluation metrics: <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref> reports the TAC, gIOU, and IOU scores of various temporal methods discussed in the paper. </p></div>

At training time, TIME-PLEX looks at a single time point at a time -for this, we sample a time point uniformly at random from the query interval [t b , t e ] associated with the fact. In contrast, HyTE maps each time point to bin (heuristically determined), making the data granularity coarser, and learns representation of these bins. HyTE looks at time points in an interval as well, but enumerates each interval fact to produce a separate fact for each time point beforehand. Our method of sampling is efficient as the data size is unchanged. It also ensures each fact is sampled uniformly, not hurting link prediction performance by oversampling of long duration facts. HyTE time prediction: HyTE can only predict a bin for the test fact. To convert predicted bins to years (or days), we take a mean of all years seen with the predicted bin and then do greedy coalescing to output time interval in years.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">graduatedFrom − → diedIn graduatedFrom − → hasWonPrize wasBornIn − → graduatedFrom wasBornIn − → diedIn wasBornIn − → isAffiliatedTo wasBornIn − → hasWonPrize wasBornIn − → playsFor wasBornIn − → worksAt wasBornIn − → isMarriedTo isAffiliatedTo − → diedIn worksAt − → diedIn isMarriedTo − → diedIn</formula></div>

Temporal smoothing was found to help on ICEWS datasets, however it gave no improvement for interval datasets. We tuned the parameters in a staged manner -first we tune learning rate (lr), regularization weight (r), batch size(b), and temporal smoothing weight (ts). We performed a random search in the following ranges: lr ∈ [0.0001, 1.0], r ∈ [0.0001, 1.0], b ∈ [100, 5000], and ts ∈ [0.0001, 10.0]. The models were most sensitive to regularization weight and learning rate.

While computing recurrence features, all training tuples of the form (s, r, o, T ) are reduced to (s, r, o, t), i.e., with a singleton time interval, where t = t b , the start time of T . TIME-PLEX sets a fact recurrence score, φ Rec , as follows:1. If (s, r, o, ) / ∈ KB tr , set φ Rec = 0. 2. Else, if r is not recurrent, set φ Rec = b r .This allows the model to learn to penalize repetition of relations that do not recur. 3. Find time gap (δ) to its closest recurrence: δ = min {(s,r,o,t )∈KB tr : t =t} |t − t |. (6) Then, set φ Rec (s, r, o, T = [t b , t e ]) = φ Rec (s, r, o, t b ) = w r N δ|µ r , σ r + b r . (7) The intuition is that φ Rec should penalize the proposed (s, r, o, T ) if δ is not close to the mean gap µ r . For example, (Presidential election, held in, USA, 2017) should be penalized, if (Presidential election, held in, USA, 2016) is known, and the event reoccurs every 4 years (µ r = 4, σ r ≈ 0).</figDesc></figure>
