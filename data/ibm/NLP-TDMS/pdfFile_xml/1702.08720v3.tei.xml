<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The task of unsupervised discrete representation learning is to obtain a function that maps similar (resp. dissimilar) data into similar (resp. dissimilar) discrete representations, where the similarity of data is defined according to applications of interest. It is a central machine learning task because of the compactness of the representations and ease  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Basic idea of our proposed method for unsupervised discrete representation learning. We encourage the prediction of a neural network to remain unchanged under data augmentation (Red arrows), while maximizing the information-theoretic dependency between data and their representations (Blue arrow). of interpretation. The task includes two important machine learning tasks as special cases: clustering and unsupervised hash learning. Clustering is widely applied to data-driven application domains <ref type="bibr">(Berkhin, 2006)</ref>, while hash learning is popular for an approximate nearest neighbor search for large scale information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wang et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Deep neural networks are promising to be used thanks to their scalability and flexibility of representing complicated, non-linear decision boundaries. However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, regularization of the networks is crucial to learn meaningful representations of data. Particularly, in unsupervised representation learning, target representations are not provided and hence, are unconstrained. Therefore, we need to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful representations that exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest (e.g., invariance to small perturbations or affine transformation). Naïve regularization to use is a weight decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Erin Liong et al., 2015)</ref>. Such regularization, however, encourages global smoothness of the function prediction; thus, may not necessarily impose the intended invariance on the predicted discrete representations.</p><p>arXiv:1702.08720v3 [stat.ML] 14 Jun 2017</p><p>Instead, in this paper, we use data augmentation to model the invariance of learned data representations. More specifically, we map data points into their discrete representations by a deep neural network and regularize it by encouraging its prediction to be invariant to data augmentation. The predicted discrete representations then exhibit the invariance specified by the augmentation. Our proposed regularization method is illustrated as red arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. As depicted, we encourage the predicted representations of augmented data points to be close to those of the original data points in an end-to-end fashion. We term such regularization Self-Augmented Training (SAT). SAT is inspired by the recent success in regularization of neural networks in semi-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bachman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miyato et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sajjadi et al., 2016)</ref>. SAT is flexible to impose various types of invariances on the representations predicted by neural networks. For example, it is generally preferred for data representations to be locally invariant, i.e., remain unchanged under local perturbations on data points. Using SAT, we can impose the local invariance on the representations by pushing the predictions of perturbed data points to be close to those of the original data points.</p><p>For image data, it may also be preferred for data representations to be invariant under affine distortion, e.g., rotation, scaling and parallel movement. We can similarly impose the invariance via SAT by using the affine distortion for the data augmentation.</p><p>We then combine the SAT with the Regularized Information Maximization (RIM) for clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gomes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bridle et al., 1991)</ref>, and arrive at our Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT), an information-theoretic method for learning discrete representations using deep neural networks. We illustrate the basic idea of IMSAT in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Following the RIM, we maximize information theoretic dependency between inputs and their mapped outputs, while regularizing the mapping function. IMSAT differs from the original RIM in two ways. First, IMSAT deals with a more general setting of learning discrete representations; thus, is also applicable to hash learning. Second, it uses a deep neural network for the mapping function and regularizes it in an end-to-end fashion via SAT. Learning with our method can be performed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD); thus, scales well to large datasets.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are: 1) an informationtheoretic method for unsupervised discrete representation learning using deep neural networks with the end-to-end regularization, and 2) adaptations of the method to clustering and hash learning to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related work is summarized in Section 2, while our method, IMSAT, is presented in Section 3. Experiments are provided in Section 4 and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIA SELF-AUGMENTED TRAINING</head><p>We present an intuitive and flexible regularization objective, termed Self-Augmented Training (SAT). SAT uses data augmentation to impose the intended invariance on the data representations. Essentially, SAT penalizes representation dissimilarity between the original data points and augmented ones. Let T : X → X denote a pre-defined data augmentation under which the data representations should be invariant. The regularization of SAT made on data point x is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R SAT (θ; x, T (x)) = − M m=1 Vm−1 ym=0 p θ (y m |x) log p θ (y m |T (x)),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p θ (y m |x) is the prediction of original data point x, and θ is the current parameter of the network. In Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref>, the representations of the augmented data are pushed to be close to those of the original data. Since probabilistic classifier p θ (y|x) is modeled using a deep neural network, it is flexible enough to capture a wide range of invariances specified by the augmentation function T . The regularization by SAT is then the average of R SAT (θ; x, T (x)) over all the training data points:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R SAT (θ; T ) = 1 N N n=1 R SAT (θ; x n , T (x n )).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The augmentation function T can either be stochastic or deterministic. It can be designed specifically for the applications of interest. For example, for image data, affine distortion such as rotation, scaling and parallel movement can be used for the augmentation function.</p><p>Alternatively, more general augmentation functions that do not depend on specific applications can be considered. A representative example is local perturbations, in which the augmentation function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T (x) = x + r,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where r is a small perturbation that does not alter the meaning of the data point. The use of local perturbations in SAT encourages the data representations to be locally invariant. The resulting decision boundaries between different representations tend to lie in low density regions of a data distribution. Such boundaries are generally preferred and follow the low-density separation principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grandvalet et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The two representative regulariztion methods based on local perturbations are: Random Perturbation Training (RPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bachman et al., 2014)</ref> and Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Miyato et al., 2016)</ref>. In RPT, perturbation r is sampled randomly from hyper-sphere ||r|| 2 = , where is a hyper-parameter that controls the range of the local perturbation. On the other hand, in VAT, perturbation r is chosen to be an adversarial direction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = arg max r {R SAT ( θ; x, x + r ); ||r || 2 ≤ }.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The solution of Eq. (6) can be approximated efficiently by a pair of forward and backward passes. For further details, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miyato et al. (2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">IMSAT for Clustering</head><p>In clustering, we can directly apply the RIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gomes et al., 2010)</ref> reviewed in Section 3.1. Unlike the original RIM, however, our method, IMSAT, uses deep neural networks for the classifiers and regularizes them via SAT. By representing mutual information as the difference between marginal entropy and conditional entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cover &amp; Thomas, 2012)</ref>, we have the objective to minimize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R SAT (θ; T ) − λ [H(Y ) − H(Y |X)] ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where H(·) and H(·|·) are entropy and conditional entropy, respectively.

Increasing the marginal entropy H(Y ) encourages the cluster sizes to be uniform, while decreasing the conditional entropy H(Y |X) encourages unambiguous cluster assignments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bridle et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>In practice, we can incorporate our prior knowledge on cluster sizes by modifying H(Y ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gomes et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Note that H(Y ) = log K − KL[p θ (y)|| U], where K is the number of clusters, KL[·||·] is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and U is a uniform distribution. Hence, maximization of H(Y ) is equivalent to minimization of KL[p θ (y)|| U]</formula><p>, which encourages predicted cluster distribution p θ (y) to be close to U. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gomes et al. (2010)</ref> replaced U in KL[p θ (y)|| U] with any specified class prior q(y) so that p θ (y) is encouraged to be close to q(y). In our preliminary experiments, we found that the resulting p θ (y) could still be far apart from pre-specified q(y). To ensure that p θ (y) is actually close to q(y), we consider the following constrained optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">min θ R SAT (θ; T ) + λH(Y |X), subject to KL[p θ (y)|| q(y)] ≤ δ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where δ &gt; 0 is a tolerance hyper-parameter that is set sufficiently small so that predicted cluster distribution p θ (y) is the same as class prior q(y) up to δ-tolerance. Eq. (10) can be solved by using the penalty method <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bertsekas, 1999)</ref>, which turns the original constrained optimization problem into a series of unconstrained optimization problems. Refer to Appendix B for the detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">IMSAT for Hash Learning</head><p>In hash learning, each data point is mapped into a D-bitbinary code. Hence, the original RIM is not directly applicable. Instead, we apply our method for discrete representation learning presented in Section 3.2.1.</p><p>The computation of mutual information I(Y 1 , . . . , Y D ; X), however, is intractable for large D because it involves a summation over an exponential number of terms, each of which corresponds to a different configuration of hash bits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown (2009)</ref> showed that mutual information I(Y 1 , . . . , Y D ; X) can be expanded as the sum of interaction information <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McGill, 1954)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">I(Y 1 , . . . , Y D ; X) = C⊆S Y I(C ∪ X), |C| ≥ 1, (11) where S Y ≡ {Y 1 , . . . , Y D }.</formula><p>Note that I denotes interaction information when its argument is a set of random variables.

When the argument is a set of two random variables, the interaction information reduces to mutual information between the two random variables.

In the experiments, our goal was to discover clusters that correspond well with the ground-truth categories. For the STL, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, raw pixels are not suited for our goal because color information is dominant. We therefore applied 50-layer pre-trained deep residual networks  to extract features and used them for clustering. Note that since the residual network was trained on ImageNet, each class of the STL dataset (which is a subset of ImageNet) was expected to be well-separated in the feature space. For Omniglot, 100 types of characters were sampled, each containing 20 data points. Each data point was augmented 20 times by the stochastic affine distortion described in Appendix F. For SVHN, each image was represented as a 960-dimensional GIST feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Oliva &amp; Torralba, 2001)</ref>. For Reuters and 20news, we removed stop words and retained the 2000 most frequent words. We then used tf-idf features. Refer to Appendix E for further details.</p></div>

We see that IMSAT (VAT) performed well across the datasets. The fact that our IMSAT outperformed Linear RIM, Deep RIM and Linear IMSAT (VAT) for most datasets suggests the effectiveness of using deep neural networks with an end-to-end regularization via SAT. Linear IMSAT (VAT) did not perform well even with the end-to-end regularization probably because the linear classifier was not flexible enough to model the intended invariance of the representations. We also see from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> that IMSAT (VAT) consistently outperformed IMSAT (RPT) in our experiments. This suggests that VAT is an effective regularization method in unsupervised learning scenarios.</p><p>We further conducted experiments on the Omniglot dataset to demonstrate that clustering performance can be improved by incorporating domain-specific knowledge in the augmentation function of SAT. Specifically, we used the affine distortion in addition to VAT for the augmented function of SAT. We compared the clustering accuracy of IM-SAT with three different augmentation functions: VAT, affine distortion, and the combination of VAT &amp; affine distortion, in which we simply set the regularization to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">1 2 · R SAT (θ; T VAT ) + 1 2 · R SAT (θ; T affine ),<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where T VAT and T affine are augmentation functions of VAT and affine distortion, respectively.

We observe that IMSAT (VAT &amp; affine distortion) was able to discover cluster assignments that are invariant to affine distortion as we intended. These results suggest that our method successfully captured the invariance in the hand-written character recognition in an unsupervised way.</p></div>

The performance of IM-SAT improved significantly when slightly bigger networks  were used, while the performance of Deep RIM did not improve much with the larger networks. We deduce that this is because we can better model the local invariance by using more flexible networks. Deep RIM, on the other hand, did not significantly benefit from the larger networks, because the additional flexibility of the networks was not used by the global function regularization via weight-decay. 1 In Appendix I, our deduction is supported using a toy dataset.</p><p>1 Hence, we deduce that Deep Hash, which is only regularized by weight-decay, would not benefit much by using larger networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented IMSAT, an informationtheoretic method for unsupervised discrete representation learning using deep neural networks. Through extensive experiments, we showed that intended discrete representations can be obtained by directly imposing the invariance to data augmentation on the prediction of neural networks in an end-to-end fashion. For future work, it is interesting to apply our method to structured data, i.e., graph or sequential data, by considering appropriate data augmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Relation to Denoising and Contractive Auto-encoders</head><p>Our method is related to denoising auto-encoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Vincent et al., 2008)</ref>. Auto-encoders maximize a lower bound of mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cover &amp; Thomas, 2012)</ref> between inputs and their hidden representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Vincent et al., 2008)</ref>, while the denoising mechanism regularizes the auto-encoders to be locally invariant. However, such a regularization does not necessarily impose the invariance on the hidden representations because the decoder network also has the flexibility to model the invariance to data perturbations. SAT is more direct in imposing the intended invariance on hidden representations predicted by the encoder network.</p><p>Contractive auto-encoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rifai et al., 2011)</ref> directly impose the local invariance on the encoder network by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian with respect to the weight matrices. However, it is empirically shown that such regularization attained lower generalization performance in supervised and semi-supervised settings than VAT, which regularizes neural networks in an end-to-end fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Miyato et al., 2016)</ref>. Hence, we adopted the end-to-end regularization in our unsupervised learning. In addition, our regularization, SAT, has the flexibility of modeling other types invariance such as invariance to affine distortion, which cannot be modeled with the contractive regularization. Finally, compared with the auto-encoders approaches, our method does not require learning the decoder network; thus, is computationally more efficient.</p></div>
