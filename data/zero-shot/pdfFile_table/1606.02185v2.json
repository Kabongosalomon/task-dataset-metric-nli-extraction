Models are \ntrained on OMNIGLOT data and tested on either unseen OMNIGLOT classes or MNIST with vary-\ning numbers of samples per class (K-shot) with varying numbers of classes (K-way). Comparisons \nare to Vinyals et al. (2016b) (Matching), Santoro et al. (2016) (MANN) and Koch (2015) (Siamese). \n5-shot MNIST results are included for completeness. \n\n","rows":["1","5","MNIST","70","72","-","20","10","OMNIGLOT"],"columns":["Matching","Ours","MANN","Siamese","Method"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"82.8","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","5","70"],"associatedColumns":["Method","MANN"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"94.9","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","5","70"],"associatedColumns":["Method","MANN"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"88.1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","20"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Siamese"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.9","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","5","70","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Matching"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.7","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","20","70","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Matching"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"93.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["MNIST","5","10","-","-","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"78.6","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["MNIST","1","10","70","-","72"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.1","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","5","70","-","72"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","5"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Siamese"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"97.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","5"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Siamese"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"93.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","20","70","-","72"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"97.0","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","20"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Siamese"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"99.5","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","5","70","-","72"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","5","20","70","-","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Ours"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"98.1","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","5","70","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Matching"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"93.8","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["OMNIGLOT","1","20","70","-"],"associatedColumns":["Method","Matching"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
