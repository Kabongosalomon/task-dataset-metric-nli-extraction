All methods have comparable Dice scores, while our method and the other \nVoxelMorph variants are orders of magnitude faster than ANTs or NiftiReg. Only our presented method, VoxelMorph-\ndiff, achieves both high accuracy and fast runtime while also having nearly zero non-negative Jacobian locations. All \nmethods have mean Jacobian determinants close to 1, indicating smooth deformations. Each aspect of these results is \nstudied in more details in the rest of the experiments and figures. \n\n","rows":["57 ( 1 . 0 )","ANTs ( SyN )","9059 ( 2023 )","NiftyReg ( CC )","2347 ( 202 )","VoxelMorph ( CC )","-","VoxelMorph - diff","Affine only","Supervised - diff"],"columns":["0","1","GPU sec","Avg .
