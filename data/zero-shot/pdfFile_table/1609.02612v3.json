[{"caption":"Table 1: Video Generation Preferences: We show two videos to workers on Amazon Mechanical \nTurk, and ask them to choose which video is more realistic. The table shows the percentage of times \nthat workers prefer one generations from one model over another. In all cases, workers tend to prefer \nvideo generative adversarial networks over an autoencoder. In most cases, workers show a slight \npreference for the two-stream model. \n\nand ask them \"Which video is more realistic?\" We collected over 13, 000 opinions across 150 unique \nworkers. We paid workers one cent per comparison, and required workers to historically have a 95% \napproval rating on MTurk. We experimented with removing bad workers that frequently said real \nvideos were not realistic, but the relative rankings did not change. We designed this experiment \nfollowing advice from ","rows":["Prefer VGAN Two Stream over Autoencoder","Prefer VGAN One Stream over Real","Prefer VGAN Two Stream over VGAN One Stream","6","Random Preference","8","Prefer VGAN One Stream over Autoencoder","Prefer VGAN Two Stream over Real"],"columns":["Mean","Beach","Golf","Baby",") .
