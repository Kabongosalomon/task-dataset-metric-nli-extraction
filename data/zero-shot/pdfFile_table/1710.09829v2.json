[{"caption":"Figure 3: Sample MNIST test reconstructions of a CapsNet with 3 routing iterations. (l, p, r)  represents the label, the prediction and the reconstruction target respectively. The two rightmost \ncolumns show two reconstructions of a failure example and it explains how the model confuses a \n5 and a 3 in this image. The other columns are from correct classifications and shows that model \npreserves many of the details while smoothing the noise. \n(l, p, r) \n(2, 2, 2) \n(5, 5, 5) \n(8, 8, 8)  (9, 9, 9)  (5, 3, 5) \n(5, 3, 3) \n\nInput \n\nOutput \n\nTable 1: CapsNet classification test accuracy.
