The setting \nof T \u003d 3 already performs well. In the following experi-\nment, we set T \u003d 3. \nMain Component Comparison. A few variants are pro-\nposed for ablation study. CAG w/o Infer denotes that \nCAG removes the whole dynamic directed-graph inference \nin Sec. 3.2. It means that the relations in the graph includ-\ning all the nodes and edges will not be updated and inferred. \nCAG w/o u denotes that CAG without textual-history con-\ntext u, where the whole graph merely describes visual con-\ntext cues. CAG w/o Q-att denotes CAG without word-level \nattention on question Q. CAG w/o G-att removes the graph \nattention module, where all the node representations are av-\nerage pooled to get the final graph embedding. \nAs shown in Table 1, compared with CAG, CAG w/o \nInfer drops MRR significantly from 67.56 to 65.73. It indi-\ncates that the graph inference effectively performs well for \nrelational reasoning. Learning the implicit relations among \nthe nodes is helpful to predict the final answer. CAG w/o \nu drops R@1 significantly from 54.64 to 51.83. It indicates \nthat the joint visual-textual context learning is necessary. \nRelations among the nodes can not be fully inferred with-\nout textual cues u. CAG w/o Q-att, which replaces ques-\ntion commands {q \n\n(t) \n\nw } with the sentence-level feature q s , \ndrops R@1 from 54.64 to 53.74.
