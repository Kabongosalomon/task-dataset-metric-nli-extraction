Finally, the Multi-Pseudo-Target supervision significantly increases the \nperformance, manifesting its effectiveness in helping training convergence. \nTemporal Consistency Factors: Firstly, we study the factors in the match-\ning problems, including similarity and matching strategies. As shown in Tab. 3, \nboth Hungarian and Bidirectional matching show their advantages over the sin-\ngle direction matching. Although Hungarian matching can ensure the one-to-one \nmatching relationship, it is sensitive to the similarity metric and numerical preci-\nsion, both of which are not stable in the early training stage. In contrast, bidirec-\ntional matching with the FDE similarity metric nearly achieves the best results \nacross all the evaluation metrics. Therefore, we choose bidirectional matching \nwith the FDE similarity metric. \n","rows":["ADE","?","FDE"],"columns":["Similarity","K\u003d6","Spatial","MR","Consistency","2 .
