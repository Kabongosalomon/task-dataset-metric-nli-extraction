In order to \navoid over-fitting, we reduced the size of the models to ? 3 \nmillions. Using the FSC dataset, we observed FANS-b out-\nperforms all other models with 0.86 % and 2.00 % ICER and \nIRER reduction, respectively. We speculate two reasons as why \nFANS-b outperforms FANS-c on FSC: First, the utterances in \nFSC are very short so the attention mechanism in the encoder \nis not as effective as when we deal with longer utterances con-\ntained in the larger datasets. Second, FSC is not semantically \ncomplex and has very low entropy with repetitive utterances and \nsmall number of intent and slot tags; as such, for this dataset, \na smaller model is sufficient to provide satisfactory results. We \nalso observe the gap between ICER and IRER is smaller than \nlarge data set; this is however mainly because FSC has much \nsmaller number of slot tags compared to the large dataset (3 vs \n175). We also observe IRER for the joint ASR NLU model \n\nis strikingly high; one explanation is that the 20 hours FSC is \nnot enough to train the ASR model which requires to deliver \ntranscript to the NLU modules with as low WER as possible. \nOverall, the results given in ","rows":["AA","FANS - c","LSTM","Joint ASR NLU","A2I - multi - task [ 12 ]","FANS - a","FANS - b","A2I - direct - model [ 12 ]","SA","CA"],"columns":["ICER ( % )","IRER ( % )","Size ( M )"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"1.56","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Joint ASR NLU","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.05","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - multi - task [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.45","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - multi - task [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - direct - model [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - a","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"1.03","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - b","LSTM","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.03","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - c","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - multi - task [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.14","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - a","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.9","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - c","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.37","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - direct - model [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - c","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - b","LSTM","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.71","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - b","LSTM","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["ICER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.03","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["FANS - a","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.31","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Joint ASR NLU","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["Size ( M )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.28","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["A2I - direct - model [ 12 ]","LSTM","LSTM","AA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"14.49","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Joint ASR NLU","SA","SA","CA"],"associatedColumns":["IRER ( % )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
