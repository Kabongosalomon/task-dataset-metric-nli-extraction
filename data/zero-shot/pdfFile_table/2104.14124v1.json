Specifications of Proposed Hardware Architecture \n\nthe 28-nm CMOS technology library for the experiments. \nThe performance is 320 Multiply-Accumulate operations \n(MACs) per clock cycle for 2-bit feature maps and 1-bit \nfilter weights, which means that the value of M is set to \n320. As shown in Figure 6, since the cross-channel pooling \noperations can be enabled or disabled in different layers, \nthe hardware architecture can also process Tiny-YOLOv2, \nwhich includes no cross-channel pooling operations. The \ngate counts of the CLPU and the PLPU are 197K and 2K, \nrespectively. The gate count of the PLPU is a small number \ncompared to the gate count of the whole hardware archi-\ntecture, 199K. It means that we can support cross-channel \npooling functions by increasing only 1.0% of the hard-\nware resources. Compared with Tiny-YOLOv2, it takes 1.3 \ntimes of processing time to compute the inference result of \nCondensation-Net. Since the proposed hardware can sup-\nport both Tiny-YOLOv2 and Condensation-Net, the target \nnetworks can be switched according to the target processing \ntime. \n\n","rows":["CLPU","( NAND - Gates )","Gate Count","PLPU","Tiny - YOLOv2","Processing Speed","Maximum : N ch , i ?","Filter Size"],"columns":["16 , 000","8 , 000","4 , 000","Process","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB","28 - nm CMOS Technology","13 , 384","512 ? 512 pixels","400 MHz","with virtual feature maps","Memory Size","( ? \u003d 2 ) : 124 ms","Input Image Size","Frequency","12 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Performance","Condensation - Net"],"mergedAllColumns":[": 197K","Tiny - YOLOv2 and Condensation - Net are quantized networks .",": 95 ms",": 2K","CLPU stands for Convolution Layer Processing Unit .","7 , 740","PLPU stands for Pooling Layer Processing Unit .","Weight Memory : 1 , 935 KB"],"numberCells":[{"number":"3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Processing Speed","Tiny - YOLOv2"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","12 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB","28 - nm CMOS Technology","400 MHz","512 ? 512 pixels"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 2K"]},{"number":"7?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["Filter Size","Maximum : N ch , i ?"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","16 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB","28 - nm CMOS Technology","400 MHz","512 ? 512 pixels","( ? \u003d 2 ) : 124 ms"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 95 ms"]},{"number":"3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Processing Speed","CLPU"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","12 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB","28 - nm CMOS Technology","400 MHz","512 ? 512 pixels"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 95 ms"]},{"number":"4","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":[],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","4 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Memory Size","Process","Frequency","Input Image Size","Condensation - Net","Performance"],"associatedMergedColumns":["Tiny - YOLOv2 and Condensation - Net are quantized networks ."]},{"number":"2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["( NAND - Gates )","PLPU"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","12 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 197K"]},{"number":"7","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["Filter Size","Maximum : N ch , i ?"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","16 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB","28 - nm CMOS Technology","400 MHz","512 ? 512 pixels","( ? \u003d 2 ) : 124 ms"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 95 ms"]},{"number":"2","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":[],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","4 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Memory Size","Process","Frequency","Input Image Size","Condensation - Net","Performance"],"associatedMergedColumns":["CLPU stands for Convolution Layer Processing Unit ."]},{"number":"3","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":[],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","4 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Memory Size","Process","Frequency","Input Image Size","Condensation - Net","Performance"],"associatedMergedColumns":["PLPU stands for Pooling Layer Processing Unit ."]},{"number":"4","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Filter Size"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","4 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Memory Size","Process","Frequency","Input Image Size","Condensation - Net"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 95 ms"]},{"number":"0","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["Gate Count"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384"],"associatedMergedColumns":["7 , 740"]},{"number":"1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Gate Count","CLPU"],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","8 , 000","with virtual feature maps","Feature Map Memory : 4 , 096 KB"],"associatedMergedColumns":["Weight Memory : 1 , 935 KB"]},{"number":"1","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":[],"associatedColumns":["13 , 384","4 , 000","without virtual feature maps","Memory Size","Process","Frequency","Input Image Size","Condensation - Net","Performance"],"associatedMergedColumns":[": 95 ms"]}]},{"caption":"Table 5.
