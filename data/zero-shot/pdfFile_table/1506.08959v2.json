Furthermore, these attributes can be partitioned into \ntwo groups: explicit and implicit attributes. The former \ngroup contains door number, seat number, and car type, \nwhich are represented by discrete values, while the latter \ngroup contains maximum speed and displacement (volume \nof an engine\u0027s cylinders), represented by continuous values. \nHumans can easily tell the numbers of doors and seats \nfrom a car\u0027s proper viewpoint, but hardly recognize its \nmaximum speed and displacement. We conduct interesting \nexperiments to predict these attributes in Section 4.2. \nViewpoints We also label five viewpoints for each car \nmodel, including front (F), rear (R), side (S), front-side \n(FS), and rear-side (RS). These viewpoints are labeled by \nseveral professional annotators. The quantity distribution \nof the labeled car images is shown in Table 1.
