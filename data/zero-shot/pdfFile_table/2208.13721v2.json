As indicated by the result, Model B slightly outperforms \nModel A on both validation and test set, suggesting that these augmentation methods can \nindeed be useful to the model to a certain extent, however, is limited. (2) Self-supervised \npre-training: In Model-C, we introduce the self-supervised pre-training for warming up \nthe ViT encoder. Compared with Model B which directly fine-tunes the ViT encoder (pre-\ntrained on ImageNet) on the FSC-147 training set, Model C has improved all results on \nboth validation and test sets significantly. (3) Effectiveness of mosaic: With the help of the \nmosaic method, Model-D has shown further performance improvements, demonstrating its \neffectiveness for resolving the challenge from the long-tailed challenge, by introducing im-\nages with a large number of object instances, and object distractors from different semantic \ncategories. (4) Test-time normalisation: In Model-E, we experiment with test-time nor-\nmalisation for the few-shot counting scenario, where the output prediction is calibrated by \nthe given exemplar shot. On both validation and test set, test-time normalisation has demon-\nstrated significant performance boosts. (5) On shot number: In Model E, as the number of \ngiven shots increases, e.g. 1, 2, or 3, we observe no tiny difference in the final performance, \nshowing the robustness of our proposed CounTR for visual object counting under any shots. \n\nModel \nAugmentation Selfsup Mosaic TT-Norm. # Shots \nVal \nTest \n\nMAE RMSE MAE RMSE \n\nA0 \n0 \n24.84 86.33 21.06 130.04 \nA1 \n3 \n24.68 85.89 20.98 129.58 \n\nB0 \n0 \n23.80 81.53 21.14 131.27 \nB1 \n3 \n23.67 81.40 20.93 130.75 \n\nC0 \n0 \n18.30 72.21 16.20 114.30 \nC1 \n3 \n18.19 71.47 16.05 113.11 \n\nD0 \n0 \n18.07 71.84 14.71 106.87 \nD1 \n3 \n17.40 70.33 14.12 108.01 \n\nTable 2.
