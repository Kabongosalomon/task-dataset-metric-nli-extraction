We found that applying a new \nrandom zooming range of [0.8, 1.5] alone, which increases \nthe zoom out, and gradually reducing the zoom in to 1.3, \nachieved considerable gains for Sintel in all evaluation \nparameters, with and without cropping strategy changes. \nInterestingly, increasing the zoom out range without any \nchange to the crop size provided 50% of this gain. We sug-\ngest that this is additional evidence for the existing bias in \nsmall crop sizes, as explained in Sec. 3. \n3. Removing artificial regularization.
