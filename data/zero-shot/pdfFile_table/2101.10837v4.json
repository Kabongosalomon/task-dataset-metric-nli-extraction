The \nnetworks ResNet-101 [48] (59.3 M), DenseNet-161 [55]) (43.2 M), HRNet-V2 [105] (65.9), and \nU-Net [16] (31.0) consists more number of parameters compared to IkshanaNet-main (4 M). To make \nit a fair comparison, we include DeeplabV3+ [19] with several light-weight encoder networks (such \nas ResNet-18 [48], MobileNet-V2 [96], EfficientNet-b1 [97], and RegNetY-08 [98]) along with the \nnetworks from the baseline experiments. \nHere, we conduct a data ablation study on five different subsets of the training data, T 1487 , T 743 , T 371 , \nT 185 , and T 92 (suffix number represents the number of training samples in the subset) by using the \nsame validation set (500 images). \nIn table 2, we provide the mean class IoU results evaluated on the validation set, the average M.IoU \nscore, the number of parameters (in million)), and the GFLOPs [106] (calculated with an input \nresolution of 1x512x1024x3 ). \nFrom table 2, we observe the following: \n(i) U-Net [16] (T avg -32.2) achieves top average performance within the baselines \n(ii) Even though U-Net [16] consists of 31M parameters, it still managed to outperform its lightweight \ncounterparts. \n(iii) IkshanaNet outperformed all other baselines in the M.IoU score and the average M.IoU score in \nall five subsets. \n(iv) IkshanaNet consists of fewer parameters, and EfficientNet-b1 [97] consists of fewer GFLOPs \nthan other networks. \n\n","rows":["U - Net [ 16 ]","networks ResNet - 101 [ 48 ]","EfficientNet - b1 [ 97 ]","MobileNet - V2 [ 96 ]","HRNet - V2 [ 105 ]","ResNet - 18 [ 48 ]","RegNetY - 08 [ 98 ]","ResNet101 [ 48 ]","ResNet - 101 [ 48 ]","IkshanaNet - Main","DenseNet161 [ 55 ]","DenseNet - 161 [ 55 ]"],"columns":["bus","bicycle","truck","sign","vegetation","pole","rider","building","motorcycle","T","road","car","Data ablation study :","Param ( M )","92","Table 1 : Class - wise IoU results of the Cityscapes baseline experiments","terrain","traffic","train","T 1487","sidewalk","sky","GFLOPs","Average","T avg","Method","light","person","wall","fence"],"mergedAllColumns":["While trained on few data samples , the network size might strongly influence the performance .
