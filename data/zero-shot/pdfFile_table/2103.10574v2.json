[{"caption":"well our tracking component performs. For CATER. we also compare with the results in Girdhar \u0026  Ramanan (2020). Details of the baselines are available in Appendix H. We evaluate models using \nTop-1 and Top-5 accuracy, as well as mean L 1 distance of the predicted grid cell from the ground \ntruth following Girdhar \u0026 Ramanan (2020). L 1 is cognizant of the grid structure and will penalize \nconfusion between adjacent cells less than those between distant cells. \n\nMethods \nFPS # Frames Top 1 ? Top 5 ?

For all methods, \nwe find that the performance on CATER-h is lower than that on CATER, which demonstrates the \ndifficulty of CATER-h. Such performance loss is particularly severe for the tracking baseline and the \ntemporal video understanding methods (TPN and TSM). The DaSiamRPN tracking approach only \nsolves about a third of the videos on CATER and less than 20% on CATER-h. This is because the \ntracker is unable to maintain object permanence through occlusions and containments, showcasing \nthe challenging nature of the task. Our Hungarian tracking has 46.0% Top-1 on CATER and 37.2% \nTop-1 on CATER-h. On CATER, TPN and TSM, as two state-of-the-art methods focusing on \ntemporal modeling for videos, achieve a higher accuracy than methods in Girdhar \u0026 Ramanan \n(2020). However, on CATER-h, TPN only has 50.2% Top-1 accuracy and 44.0% for TSM.
