The non-trainable (i.e., fixed) variant \nperforms substantially worse, but still yields surprisingly \nstrong ? 24 BLEU with fixed random attention weights. \nMost other SYNTHESIZER variants achieve competitive per-\nformance, although with slight performance degradation \ncompared to Transformers. An interesting finding is that \nthe Mixture model of Random + Dense synthesizer per-\nforms comparably to vanilla Transformers on EnDe. When \nmixing the standard dot product attention, performance fur-\nther increases by +0.8 BLEU points (EnDe). In general, \nthe performance of SYNTHESIZER variants are competitive \nwith Transformers for this task. On LM1b, We find that the \nRandom Synthesizers perform within 1-2 PPL points away \nfrom the vanilla Transformer model. The best performing \nmodel is the Synthesizer (D+V), which achieves the best \nperformance on this setting. \n\nResults on Text Generation For summarization, we find \nthat the (R) and (D) variants do not outperform Transform-\ners. The performance of the (D) model is ? 2 Rouge-L \npoints below Transformers. Hence, we postulate that the \nlocal sample-wise pairwise interactions are important for \nthe summarization task. On the other hand, the utility of \nsynthesized attention can also be observed, i.e., the (R+V) \nand (R+D) models both outperform Transformers. On the \ndialogue task, Synthesizers (R) and (D) both outperform \nvanilla Transformers by a reasonable margin (? 1-3) points \nacross most/all metrics. The best performing model here \nis the (D) variant. Surprisingly, unlike most other tasks, \nthe (+V) variants do not perform well, signifying that dot \nproduct self-attention may actually be harmful for this task. \n\nSum. \nDialogue \nModel \nRL \nB4 \nRL \nMet.
