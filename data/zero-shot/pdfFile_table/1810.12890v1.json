[{"caption":"Implementation Details We trained models on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and used the \nofficial Tensorflow implementations for ResNet-50 1 and AmoebaNet 2 . We used the default image \nsize (224 ? 224 for ResNet-50 and 331 ? 331 for AmoebaNet), batch size (1024 for ResNet-50 and \n2048 for AmoebaNet) and hyperparameters setting for all the models. We only increased number \nof training epochs from 90 to 270 for ResNet-50 architecture. The learning rate was decayed by \nthe factor of 0.1 at 125, 200 and 250 epochs. AmoebaNet models were trained for 340 epochs \nand exponential decay scheme was used for scheduling learning rate. Since baselines are usually \noverfitted for the longer training scheme and have lower validation accuracy at the end of training, \nwe report the highest validation accuracy over the full training course for fair comparison. \n\n4.1.1 DropBlock in ResNet-50 \n\nResNet-50 [4] is a widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image recogni-\ntion. In the following experiments, we apply different regularization techniques on ResNet-50 and \ncompare the results with DropBlock. The results are summarized in Table 1. \n\n","rows":["ResNet - 50 + dropout ( kp\u003d0 . 7 ) [ 1 ]","ResNet - 50","ResNet - 50 + AutoAugment [ 27 ]","ResNet - 50 + DropBlock ( kp\u003d0 . 9 ) + label smoothing ( 0 . 1 )","ResNet - 50 + label smoothing ( 0 . 1 ) [ 28 ]","ResNet - 50 + Cutout [ 23 ]","ResNet - 50 + DropBlock , ( kp\u003d0 . 9 )","ResNet - 50 + SpatialDropout ( kp\u003d0 . 9 ) [ 20 ]","the factor of","ResNet - 50 + DropPath ( kp\u003d0 . 9 ) [ 17 ]"],"columns":["top - 1 ( % )","We trained models on Tensor Processing Units ( TPUs ) and used the","top - 5 ( % )","DropBlock in ResNet - 50"],"mergedAllColumns":["of training epochs from 90 to 270 for ResNet - 50 architecture .
