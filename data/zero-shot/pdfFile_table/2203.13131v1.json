Comparison with previous work (FID and human prefer-\nence). FID is calculated over a subset of 30k images generated \nfrom the MS-COCO validation set text prompts. When possible, \nwe include models trained with and without (filtered) the MS-\nCOCO training set. In both scenarios our model achieves state \nof the art results, correlating with visual samples and human eval-\nuation. We add a loose practical lower-bound (denoted as ground-\ntruth), calculated between the training and validation subsets of \nMS-COCO. Human evaluation is shown as a percentage of major-\nity votes in favor of our method when comparing between a certain \nmodel and ours. \n\n","rows":["AttnGAN [ 64 ]","Ours","DM - GAN [ 72 ]","CogView 256 [ 12 ]","CogView 512 [ 12 ]","DALL - E [ 45 ]","XMC - GAN [ 67 ]","256","DM - GAN+CL [ 65 ]","DF - GAN [ 54 ]","Ground - truth","LAFITE [ 70 ]","GLIDE [ 41 ]"],"columns":["( filt . )","Photo -","FID?","quality realism alignment","Text","Image","-"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"94.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 256 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Photo -","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"81.8%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DALL - E [ 45 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Image","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"65.9%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DALL - E [ 45 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Text","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"92.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 256 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Text","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"2.47","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["Ground - truth"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"-36.53","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 512 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"87.8%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 512 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Text","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"-12.24","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["GLIDE [ 41 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"20.79","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN+CL [ 65 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"7.55","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["Ours","256"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"21.42","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DF - GAN [ 54 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"26.94","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LAFITE [ 70 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"9.33","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["XMC - GAN [ 67 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"35.49","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN [ 64 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"88.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 512 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Photo -","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"11.84","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["Ours","256"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"-32.20","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 256 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"32.64","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN [ 72 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"8.12","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["LAFITE [ 70 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"92.2%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 256 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Image","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"-34.60","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DALL - E [ 45 ]"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","( filt . )","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"91.1%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["CogView 512 [ 12 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Image","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"81.0%","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DALL - E [ 45 ]"],"associatedColumns":["Photo -","quality realism alignment","-","-","-","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]},{"caption":"Table 2.
