Experimental results on NUS-81-Web are shown in \nTable 3. Our proposed method outperforms baseline model and \nthe model finetuned by only CNN labels for all three metrics. For \nthe mAP score, we achieve 0.9% improvement using VSGraph-LC \ncompared to the pretrained model. Our method can also increase \nboth C-F1 and O-F1 by 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Unlike the \nperformance on WebVision, finetuning with CNN labels brings no \nsignificant improvement on C-F1 and mAP, and even a 0.4% drop \non O-F1.
