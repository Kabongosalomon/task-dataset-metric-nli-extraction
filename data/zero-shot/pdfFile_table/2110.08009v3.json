[{"caption":"Table 1: FID obtained by StyleGAN2 (config-f) trained on FFHQ using standard and MaGNET \nsampling (pixel-space) for varying degrees of truncation (?). (Left) FID score obtained for 50,000 \nsamples generated by a mixture of MaGNET and standard sampling. MaGNET samples can be used \nto increase diversity of the model, resulting in better FID than current state-of-the-art. (Right) FID \nscore for varying truncation without mixing. \n\n","rows":["1","100%","33%","Algorithm 1 : MaGNET Sampling as described in Sec .","MaGNET","20%","Standard","-"],"columns":["Percent","?","FID ( ?
