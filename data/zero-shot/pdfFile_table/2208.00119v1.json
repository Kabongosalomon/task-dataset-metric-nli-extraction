Note \nthat some approaches also consider GoogleNet [46] (G d ) as the backbone. Here, \nwe mainly consider the settings of d \u003d 128, 512. R 128 is used as the default back-\nbone. The embedding layer is randomly initialized. Regarding evaluation metrics, \nRecall at k (R@k) [24], Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) [43] and F1 score \n(F1) [45] are used, where R@k measures the image retrieval performance while \nF1 and NMI measure the image clustering performance. For hyper-parameters \nin DAS, we set (T, K, Z, r s , r b ) \u003d (3, 4, 10, 1e ?2 , 1e ?2 ) by default. 4 Our source \ncode is publicly available at https://github.com/lizhaoliu-Lec/DAS. \n\n","rows":["G 384","MS + DAS ( K \u003d 8 ) ( Ours )","RLL - H [ 52 ]","MS + EE * [ 28 ]","N / A","ProxyAnchor [ 25 ]","ABE [ 27 ]","G 512","IBN 512","Margin [ 56 ]","HDC [ 59 ]","MS ?

Multi-dimensional embeddings have a diverse set of se-\nmantic features [2, 3]. The top-K mask is effective to discover the discriminative \nfeatures. We perform experiments on SOP, a large-scale and diverse dataset with \nmargin loss to support our claim.

The larger bank capacity (Z) allows us to access intra-class \ntransformations from current and previous iterations, which improves the diver-\nsity of the produced embeddings.
