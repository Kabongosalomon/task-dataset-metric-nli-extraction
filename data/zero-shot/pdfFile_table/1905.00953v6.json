It is clear that OSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, \nsurpassing most published methods by a clear margin. It is noteworthy that OSNet has only 2.2 million parameters, which \nare far less than the current best-performing ResNet-based methods. -: not available.  ?: model trained from scratch.  ?: \nreproduced by us. (Best and second best results in red and blue respectively) \n\npact network. As OSNet is orthogonal to some methods, \nsuch as the image generation based DGNet [84], they can \nbe potentially combined to further boost the re-ID perfor-\nmance. (2) OSNet yields strong performance with or with-\nout ImageNet pre-training. Among the very few existing \nlightweight re-ID models that can be trained from scratch \n(HAN and BraidNet), OSNet exhibits huge advantages. At \nR1, OSNet beats HAN/BraidNet by 2.4%/9.9% on Mar-\nket1501 and 4.2%/8.3% on Duke. The margins at mAP are \neven larger. In addition, general-purpose lightweight CNNs \nare also compared without ImageNet pre-training. Table 3 \nshows that OSNet surpasses the popular MobileNetV2 and \nShuffleNet by large margins on all datasets. Note that \nall three networks have similar model sizes. These re-\nsults thus demonstrate the versatility of our OSNet: It \nenables effective feature tuning from generic object cate-\ngorisation tasks and offers robustness against model over-\nfitting when trained from scratch on datasets of moderate \nsizes. (3) Compared with re-ID models that deploy a multi-\nscale/multi-stream architecture, namely those with a Incep-\ntion or ResNeXt backbone [29, 49, 4, 66, 2, 47], OSNet is \nclearly superior. As analysed in Sec. 3, this is attributed to \nthe unique ability of OSNet to learn heterogeneous-scale \nfeatures by combining multiple homogeneous-scale fea-\ntures with the dynamic AG. \n\n","rows":["DenseNet","PNGAN [ 39 ]","CAMA [ 71 ]","MobileNetV2 ? ?
