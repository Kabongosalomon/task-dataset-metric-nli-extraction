[{"caption":"Table 1. Results for various applications on the NYUv2 test set. We use distributional outputs from our common model to generate depth \nestimates in a diverse variety of application settings: from standard monocular estimation to several applications when different forms of \nadditional depth cues are available. We compare to other methods for these applications, including those (shaded background) dependent \non task-specific networks trained separately for each setting. Our network, in contrast, is task-agnostic and trained only once. \n\n","rows":["Ours","Liao [ 27 ]","DORN [ 8 ]","15","Horiz .","*","* Metrics computed only on filled - in regions .","160","Chen [ 4 ]","-","Levin [ 24 ]","240","120","Line","320","100","Depth Un -
