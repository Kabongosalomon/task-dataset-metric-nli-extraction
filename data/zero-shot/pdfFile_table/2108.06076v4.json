EdgeConv performs feature aggre-\ngating at each point and enables each point to exchange in-\nformation with its neighboring points, but does not lever-\nage attention mechanisms. We can see that the RA mod-\n\nule achieves better results than the no-attention baselines. \nThe performance gap between RA and MLP baselines is \nsignificant: 94.1% vs. 92.6% and 86.6% vs. 85.3%, an re-\nspectivel improvement of 1.5 and 1.3 absolute percentage \npoints. Compared with EdgeConv baseline, our RA module \nalso achieves improvements of 0.9 and 0.9 absolute percent-\nage points, respectively. \n","rows":["MLP","EdgeConv","w / o rel . pos","f ull","PVT"],"columns":["ModelNet40 ( OA )","ShapeNet ( mIoU )"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"86.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["w / o rel . pos"],"associatedColumns":["ShapeNet ( mIoU )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"93.1","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["EdgeConv"],"associatedColumns":["ModelNet40 ( OA )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"92.6","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["MLP"],"associatedColumns":["ModelNet40 ( OA )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"86.6","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["w / o rel . pos","PVT","f ull"],"associatedColumns":["ShapeNet ( mIoU )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"93.2","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["w / o rel . pos"],"associatedColumns":["ModelNet40 ( OA )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"85.8","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["EdgeConv"],"associatedColumns":["ShapeNet ( mIoU )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"94.1","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["w / o rel . pos","PVT","f ull"],"associatedColumns":["ModelNet40 ( OA )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"85.3","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["MLP"],"associatedColumns":["ShapeNet ( mIoU )"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
