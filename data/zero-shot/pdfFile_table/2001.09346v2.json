Almost 20% \nof the samples are categorized as seizure activity. So, we are \ndealing with an unbalanced dataset in a binary classifica-\ntion setting. The first 178 features are the values of the Elec-\ntroencephalogram (EEG) recordings at different time points, \nand the last feature is the class. There are five values for \nthe class label (y \u003d 1, ..., 5). Except for y \u003d 1, the rest of \nthe classes indicate subjects who do not have an epileptic \nseizure.
