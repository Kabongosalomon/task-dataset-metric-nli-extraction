Three metrics are included: (1) Mention Extrac-\ntion (ME) in mention-level F1 score (2) Coreference Resolution (COREF) in averaged F1 score of MUC, B 3 , and \nCEAF ?4 (3) Relation Extraction (RE) in entity-level F1 score. DocRED also provides a F1 score (RE Ign) that \nexcludes shared relational facts between training and evaluation. Three related work with the same end-to-end ob-\njective are shown, and they all employ certain mention-level decoding similar to our Joint-M. Note that Verlinden \net al. (2021) also utilizes external knowledge; Eberts and Ulges (2021) is not directly comparable as their reported \nnumbers are on a self-split development set instead of the official test set. \n\n","rows":["BERT - based","Zaporojets et al .
