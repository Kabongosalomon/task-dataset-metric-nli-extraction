Results of semantic segmentation on Cityscapes. We evaluate our best result on the online test benchmark and compare it with \nrelevant previous work, where possible. We also report the computational complexity (GFLOP, FPS) GPU on which the inference was \nperformed, and the image resolution on which the training and inference were performed. The column GFLOPs@1Mpx shows the GFLOPs \nmetric when the input resolution is 1MPx. The column FPS norm shows or estimates the FPS metric on GTX 1080Ti. The default SwiftNet \nconfiguration is the single scale model presented in 3.2. Label pyr denotes the pyramid fusion model presented in 3.3. Label ens denotes \nthe ensemble of the single scale model and the pyramid model. The symbol  ? designates ImageNet pre-training. \n\n","rows":["SwiftNetMN V2 ?","SwiftNetRN - 18 ?","SwiftNetRN - 18","2048x1024","112","TitanX M","1024x512","configuration is the single scale model presented in","val","test","38","ICNet [ 40 ]","-","DG2s [ 35 ]","ERFNet [ 28 ]","GUNet ?
