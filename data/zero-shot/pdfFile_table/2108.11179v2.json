If a smaller batch size, \nequal to 384, is used for RS@k, it reaches a performance of \n81.2%, 92.2%, 96.9% and 99.0% on r@10 0 , r@10 1 , r@10 2 \nand r@10 3 respectively. This result shows that large batch \nsize helps in improving the performance, but RS@k outper-\nforms the competing methods even with smaller batch size. \nVehicleID. The results on VehicleID [29] are presented in \nTable 2. RS@k outperforms the competing methods both \nwith and without SiMix. Better results were observed with-\nout SiMix where RS@k reaches recall@1 performance of \n95.7%, 94.6% and 93.8% on the small, medium, and large \ntest sets, respectively. \nCars196. Evaluation on a small scale dataset, Cars196 [27]  is presented in the Table 2. We train SAP with a batch size \n\nof 392; it provides a performance of 79.5%, 86.6%, 91.2%, \nand 94.4% and when combined with SiMix a performace of \n85.4%, 91.0%, 94.3% and 96.7% on r@1, r@2, r@4 and \nr@8 respectively. SiMix makes a large difference in perfor-\nmance for both RS@k and SAP [6], primarily because of a \nsmaller batch size (392), as constrained by the low number \nof classes. With SiMix, RS@k reaches the state-of-the-art \nresults on three out of four recall@k values. If the batch \nsize is further increased to 588 by changing the number of \nsamples per class from 4 to 6, then RS@k provides a larger \ngain with performance 88.3%, 93.3%, 95.9% and 97.6%. \nResults with ViT-B. The results by replacing the ResNet-\n50 [20] backbone with a ViT-B [10] for SAP [6] and the pro-\nposed RS@k are also shown in Table 2. With an exception \nof ViT-B/32 on VehicleID and Cars196 datasets, the use of \nViT-B backbone leads to better performance for both meth-\nods, compared to the ResNet counterpart. It can be clearly \nseen that RS@k outperforms SAP [6] on all datasets. ViT-\nB/16 when trained with RS@k shows unprecedented per-\nformance on all datasets reaching recall@1 score of 83.9% \non iNaturalist [61], 88.0% on SOP [39], 96.2% on Vehi-\ncleID [29] (small) and 89.5% on Cars196 [27]. Note that \nwhile ResNet-50 has 24.5 M parameters and operates with \n8.12 GMac/image, ViT-B has 87.8 M parameters and op-\nerates with 4.36 and 16.8 GMac/image for ViT-B/32 and \nViT-B/16 respectively. \nConcurrent work.
