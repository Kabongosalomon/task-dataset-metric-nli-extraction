Different from \nVoxCeleb, the CNCeleb1\u00262 dataset includes in-the-wild speech ut-\nterances of 3,000 speakers in 11 different genres, which leads to \ncomplex and composite inter-session variations, both intrinsic (i.e., \nspeaking style, physiological status) and extrinsic (i.e., recording \ndevice, background noise) ","rows":["Proposed","PLDA","Cosine"],"columns":["minDCF ( 0 . 01 )","EER ( % )","minDCF ( 0 . 001 )","Table 2 .
