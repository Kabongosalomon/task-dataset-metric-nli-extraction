Comparison of our new TRAF dataset with various traffic datasets in terms of heterogeneity and density of traffic agents. \nHeterogeneity is described in terms of the number of different agents that appear in the overall dataset. Density is the total number of \ntraffic agents per Km in the dataset. The value for each agent type under \"Agents\" corresponds to the average number of instances of that \nagent per frame of the dataset. It is computed by taking all the instances of that agent and dividing by the total number of frames. Visibility \nis a ballpark estimate of the length of road in meters that is visible from the camera. NGSIM data were collected using tower-mounted \ncameras (bird\u0027s eye view), whereas both Beijing and TRAF data presented here were collected with car-mounted cameras (frontal view).
