[{"caption":"Table 1: Summary of our findings for density modeling tasks, in terms of bits per dimension (BPD) on \nthe test set. Model types are autoregressive (AR), normalizing flows (Flow), variational autoencoders \n(VAE), or diffusion models (Diff). Our results were obtained using the continuous-time formulation of \nour model. CIFAR-10 data augmentations are: (A) extensive, (B) small translations, or (C) horizontal \nflips. The numbers for VDM are variational bounds, and can likely be improved by estimating \nthe marginal likelihood through importance sampling, or through evaluation of the corresponding \ncontinuous normalizing flow as done by Song et al. [2021a]. \n\n","rows":["Image Transformer [ Parmar et al . , 2018 ]","Diff","CR - NVAE [ Sinha and Dieng , 2021 ]","VDM ( variational bound )","PixelCNN [ Van Oord et al . , 2016 ]","EBM - DRL [ Gao
