We show \nthe average accuracy on Small Datasets. Unless specified, \nTPR@FAR\u003d1e-4 metric is used for IJBC and Megafce is \nFPR@FAR\u003d1e-6 by default. Training with instance-based \nloader or identity-based loader can obtain comparable re-\nsults on small datasets. Instance-based loader outperforms \nidentity-based loader on IJBC and MegaFace by a large \nmargin. It could be explained that only using identity loader \ncan not ensure all the images are sampled. Using dual data \nloaders can improve the performance compared with each \nsingle loader obviously, which is consistent to our analysis. \nNote that, to make fair comparison, the results are obtained \nwith the same number of samples fed to the model, not with \nthe same number of epoch. \nSingle Net or Dual Nets?
