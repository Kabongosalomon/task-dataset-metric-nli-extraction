In Table 3, we report the text classification results on BoolQ, RTE and QNLI. \nHere, there are only two cases (BERT on QNLI and LSTM on RTE) where CBS leads to performance \ndrops compared to the conventional training regime. In all other cases, the improvements of CBS are \nbelow 0.6%. Just as in the image classification experiments, LeRaC brings accuracy gains for each \nand every model and dataset. In four out of six scenarios, the accuracy gains yielded by LeRaC are \nhigher than 1.3%. Once again, LeRaC proves to be the best and most consistent regime, generally \noutperforming CBS by significant margins. \n\n","rows":["conventional","CBS [ 21 ]","DenseNet - 121","LeRaC ( ours )","CvT -
