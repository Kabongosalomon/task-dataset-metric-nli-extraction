[{"caption":"Table 1: Average per-task accuracy (%) at the end of all episodes. MNIST, Permuted-MNIST and Rotated-\nMNIST are not informative benchmarks for judging forward and backward transfer because even Isolated \nachieves 99%+ accuracy. Model Zoo outperforms, by significant margins, all existing continual learning methods \non all datasets. Accuracy of existing methods is worse than Isolated which suggests little to no forward or \nbackward transfer. Model Zoo-small and Isolated-small have comparable number of weights as that of existing \nmethods, and in some cases, much fewer. Model Zoo-Resnet18-S and Isolated-Resnet18-S, make use of the \nResnet18-S architecture from Lopez-Paz and Ranzato (2017). Both Model Zoo/Isolated have similar accuracies \non Split-CIFAR100 with 3 different architectures and all of them are better than existing methods. This indicates \nthat the improvement in accuracy is not a result of the specific choice of architecture.
