Since Butnaru et al. [19]  already tuned the hyperparameters of the character-level \nCNNs on the MOROCO validation set, we decided to use the \nsame parameters and skip the grid search. Hence, we set the \nlearning rate to 5 ? 10 ?4 and use mini-batches of 128 samples. \nEach CNN is trained for 50 epochs in 5 trials, keeping the \nmodel with highest validation accuracy for evaluation on test. \nFor (leaky) ADA and (leaky) PyNADA, we obtain optimal \nresults with c \u003d 1, while ? is either validated or optimized \nduring training. \n\nResults. We present the dialect identification results on \nMOROCO in Table 1. First, we observe the baseline CNN and \nCNN+SE models confirm the results reported by Butnaru et \nal. [19]. For the character-level CNN (without SE blocks), we \nobtain the largest improvement on the test set when we re-\nplace ReLU (92.79%) with ADA (93.68%). Furthermore, the \nimprovements of leaky ADA, PyNADA and leaky PyNADA \nare all higher than 0.6%, and the differences are statistically \nsignificant. The results are somewhat consistent among the \ntwo architectures, CNN and CNN+SE. For example, for \nthe CNN+SE model, we report the largest improvement by \nreplacing ReLU (92.99%) with ADA (93.99%), just as for \nthe CNN without SE blocks. Our highest absolute gain on \nMOROCO is 1%. Overall, the results indicate that all variants \nof (leaky) ADA and (leaky) PyNADA attain significantly \nbetter results than the corresponding baselines. We observe \nthat neither character-level CNN model is able to converge \nusing RBF as activation. For RBF, we reported the test \naccuracy corresponding to the last model before the gradients \nexplode. Interestingly, PyNRBF is able to converge, probably \ndue to the basal tuft based on ReLU, but its performance \nlevel is not adequate.
