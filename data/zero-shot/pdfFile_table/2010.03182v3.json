The number of trainable parameters for the basic relational graph GCN is 17,258,800 while \nfor the six position-enhanced GCN are 492,200 (left of), 488,400 (right of), 632,000 (above), 657,200 \n(below), 63,800 (inside) and 54,600 (surrounding) respectively. The final hidden state is used as em-\nbedding and the concatenated E vs is 1200d. For AttnGAN and DM-GAN, we used their word feature \nE word (256d) and the sentence feature E sent (256d) extracted by the pre-trained DAMSM text encoder \nand applied the attention with E vs . We replaced the derived E V ICT R?W and E V ICT R?S with the ini-\ntial word feature E word and sentence feature E sent respectively in the original models. We kept all the \nbest-performance configuration as it is from the three original models for comparison. We trained the \nStackGAN with VICTR on stage-I for 600 epoch as the same in the stackGAN paper and trained the \nStackGAN with VICTR on stage-II and the other two models (AttnGAN VICTR and DM-GAN VICTR) \nfor 150 epoch. StackGAN-VICTR has the same number of trainable parameters as StackGAN, which are \n32,735,457 for stage-I and 197,327,218 for stage-II. For AttnGAN-VICTR and DM-GAN-VICTR, there \nare 256,168,838 and 44,154,260 respectively for the GAN part and 614,400 for the weight W . All ex-\nperiments are conducted on 24 GB NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU with 10.2 CUDA. With our environment, \nit took around 24(21)min/epoch on stage-I and 45(40)min/epoch on stage-II training for StackGAN with \nVICTR (StackGAN), 57(51)min/epoch for AttnGAN with VICTR (AttnGAN) and 60(56)min/epoch for \nDM-GAN with VICTR (DM-GAN). \n","rows":[],"columns":[],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[]},{"caption":"Table 2: Inception score (IS), Fr?chet Inception Distance (FID), R-precision results of VICTR-based \nmodels comparing to all baseline models. \n\n","rows":["StackGAN","DM - GAN with VICTR","StackGAN with VICTR","AttnGAN","AttnGAN with VICTR","DM - GAN"],"columns":["FID?","IS?","-","R - precision?"],"mergedAllColumns":[],"numberCells":[{"number":"30.49?","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".57","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"3.69","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".0063","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"32.64","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"32.37","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"32.37?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"0.28","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"10.38?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["StackGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"90.37?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"35.49","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".20","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["StackGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".0039","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".31","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"25.89?","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".47","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"28.18?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"88.56?","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["DM - GAN"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".03","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["StackGAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"86.39?","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"8.45?","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["StackGAN"],"associatedColumns":["IS?"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"85.47?","isBolded":false,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN"],"associatedColumns":["R - precision?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":"29.26","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["FID?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]},{"number":".51","isBolded":true,"associatedRows":["AttnGAN with VICTR"],"associatedColumns":["IS?","-","-"],"associatedMergedColumns":[]}]}]
