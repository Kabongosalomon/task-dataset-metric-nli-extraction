<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Text summarization aims to condense long documents and retain key information. Critical to the success of a summarization model is the faithful inference of latent representations of words or tokens in the source documents. Most recent models infer the latent representations with a transformer encoder, which is purely bottom-up. Also, self-attention-based inference models face the challenge of quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. We propose a principled inference framework to improve summarization models on these two aspects. Our framework assumes a hierarchical latent structure of a document where the toplevel captures the long range dependency at a coarser time scale and the bottom token level preserves the details. Critically, this hierarchical structure enables token representations to be updated in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. In the bottom-up pass, token representations are inferred with local self-attention to leverage its efficiency. Top-down correction is then applied to allow tokens to capture long-range dependency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a diverse set of summarization datasets, including narrative, conversational, scientific documents and news. Our model achieves (1) competitive or better performance on short documents with higher memory and compute efficiency, compared to full attention transformers, and (2) state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of long document summarization benchmarks, compared to recent efficient transformers. We also show that our model can summarize an entire book and achieve competitive performance using 0.27% parameters (464M vs. 175B) and much less training data, compared to a recent GPT-3-based model. These results indicate the general applicability and benefits of the proposed framework.</p><p>1 k , which is simple and convenient. In the second approach, we leverage the reference summary to define the importance of each token to assign adaptive weights (AdaPool).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Text summarization involves compressing a document and preserving key content and meaning. It can be done in either an extractive or abstractive manner. While an extractive summarization model extracts salient fragments (e.g., words, sentences) from the source document to form a summary, an abstractive summarization system aims to generate a semantically coherent and linguistically fluent summary by conditioning on the document. The abstractive approach aligns better with how a human does summarization and generally performs better than extractive models in recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pilault et al., 2020;</ref>. We thus focuses on abstractive summarization.</p><p>The dominant approach for abstractive summarization is to use a Seq2Seq model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sutskever et al., 2014)</ref> with an encoder-decoder architecture instantiated with either RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> or, more recently, transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. In such a model, an encoder infers the latent representations of observed tokens (words or subwords) in the document, conditioning on which a decoder generates a summary. This paper studies the problem of how to infer good latent representations, which in turn would improve summarization. We propose a framework which (1) assumes a multi-scale latent structure of a document and (2) synergizes bottom-up inference with top-down inference. In a multi-scale structure, high-level variables (like those representing sentences, segments) model the document at a coarser time-scale and abstract away details, and are suitable for capturing long range dependency of the document; in contrast, low-level variables (like those representing tokens) preserves details, and prevent the summary from losing key details. In our framework, the summary is generated by conditioning on token representations (low-level variables), similar to recent abstractive summarization models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zaheer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>. There is however a critical difference. In our framework, token representations are first bottom-up inferred and then top-down updated with high level representations, hence rendering low-level representations aware of long range information. We hypothesize that the proposed inference approach would improve summarization.</p><p>Multi-level models have been widely studied in modeling for images <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(S?nderby et al., 2016)</ref>, speech <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mehri et al., 2016)</ref>, and language <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chung et al., 2016)</ref>. Prior summarization works <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheng &amp; Lapata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xu et al., 2020)</ref> have also explored hierarchical models. But they mostly focus on extractive summarization and follow a bottom-up inference approach. They pool information in words or sub-words to form sentence representations, based on which a classification is done to make an extraction decision.</p><p>In comparison, our framework combines bottom-up and top-down inference. This draws direct inspiration from a line of work which examines variational inference for hierarchical top-down generative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(S?nderby et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Maal?e et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Child, 2020)</ref>. In these models, in the bottom-up path distribution parameters of higher level stochastic variables are computed as a function of lower level stochastic variables, while in the top-down path distribution parameters of lower level variables are corrected for as a function of higher level variables. Although we do not assume stochasticity of the document latent representations, our encoder or inference model follows the same idea to infer token representations.</p><p>The proposed framework is agnostic to model architecture. Due to the dominance of transformer models in NLP <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sun et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Martin et al., 2020)</ref> and to leverage pre-trained language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lewis et al., 2020)</ref>, we instantiate our framework with a transformer-based model. There is a bottleneck of applying transformers to long documents, because its computational and memory cost has a quadratic dependency on the sequence length. This issue is especially critical for summarization since we are more interested in summarizing long documents since short ones can be quickly read through by humans. To address this issue, a large amount of prior works have been devoted to developing efficient transformers with sub-quadratic complexity. They approach this problem with kernel-based methods <ref type="bibr">(Katharopoulos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choromanski et al., 2020)</ref>, by low-rank approximation to the attention matrix , by synthesizing the attention weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tay et al., 2021)</ref>, or by designing contentindependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Child et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beltagy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zaheer et al., 2020)</ref> or content-dependent sparse attention mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kitaev et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Roy et al., 2021;</ref>.</p><p>Our framework provides a natural way to diminish this quadratic complexity issue. In the bottomup inference, we use local self-attention where each token only attends tokens within a local fixedlength window, and thus the complexity does not grow as a function of the input sequence length. The top-down correction for the token representations enable them to capture long-range context, reducing the limitation of local attention. Furthermore, in contrast to most prior efficient transformers that are incompatible with pre-training language models, our framework is flexible for leveraging any pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis et al., 2020)</ref>, T5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Raffel et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>We call the transformer-based model following the proposed framework as top-down transformer, to emphasize the importance of the top-down inference. We evaluate the top-down transformer on a set of distinct summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks cover documents from a variety of domains, including news articles and scientific, conversational, and narrative documents, and of various lengths ranging from hundreds of words (e.g., a news article), several thousands to over ten thousands of words (e.g., a scientific paper, a book chapter), to even over hundred thousands of words (e.g., an entire book). On short documents, models following our framework achieves on-par or better summarization performance than models with full self-attention, and are more computeand memory-efficient. Across all long document datasets, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance. In the end, we show that our model is able to summarize a whole book. Compared to a concurrent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wu et al., 2021)</ref> using GPT-3 and requiring humans to extensively label data, our model achieves competitive performance with 380 times less parameters and a small amount of publicly available data. The diverse and strong empirical results support the effectiveness and wide applicability of the proposed model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> gives a graphical overview of the top-down transformer, instantiating the proposed framework. We introduce its details in this section. Suppose a document has N tokens, t = {t i } N i=1 . In our method, token representations are inferred by combining top-down and bottom-up inference. This leads to effective and efficient inference for token representations. They are then attended by a decoder to generate a summary, as in a regular encoder-decoder transformer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">BOTTOM-UP INFERENCE</head><p>In the bottom-up inference, contextual embeddings of the tokens, {e i | e i ? R d } N i=1 , are computed with N 1 layers of local self-attention. In particular, each token t i only attends to nearby tokens within a window of size of w. The complexity is hence O(N w), in contrast to O(N 2 ) for a full self-attention models. Please see Supplementary B.1 for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">TOP-DOWN INFERENCE</head><p>The efficiency with local self-attention in the bottom-up inference nevertheless comes with a limitation, that is, each e i only captures the context within a local window instead of that of the whole document. To mitigate this issue, we propose a top-down inference for token representations.</p><p>Consider a two-level multi-scale latent structure for a document. The low level consists of token representations, {e i } N i=1 , computed by the bottom-up inference. The top level consists of units at a coarser level. It is affordable to apply full self-attention at the top level due to its coarser granularity, allowing these top-level units to capture global document context. In our work, the self-attention mechanism for the top-level representations is simply the original multi-head self-attention proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref>. Readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vaswani et al. (2017)</ref> for details.</p><p>Denote the top level representations after self-attention update as {s j | s j ? R d } M j=1 (see Section 2.3 for details on top-level representation initialization methods). We can then update the bottom-upinferred token representations with the top-level representations. This is achieved with N 3 top-down inference layers, as illustrated by the middle panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Each layer contains three transformations on {e i }: (1) token self-attention, (2) token-segment cross-attention, (3) feed-forward. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> are the same as those in the bottom-up inference layers or regular self-attention layer with local attention. (2) implementing the cross-attention between the top and bottom levels is the critical operation. In particular, each e i is updated with cross-attention,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e i = e i + LayerNorm( M j=1 ? ij f v (s j )), ? ij = exp (f q (e i ) T f k (s j )) ? d M l=1 exp (f q (e i ) T f k (s l ))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f q , f k , and f v indicate query, key, and value linear mappings, respectively. For notional clarity, Equation 1 only illustrates the case with a single attention head. In practice, we use multiheads. The cross-attention operation injects global contextual information into bottom-up-inferred token representations, e i , and yields global-context-aware token representations,? i , conditioning on which a summary can be generated by a decoder.</p><p>To instantiate the top-down inference, we need to make two choices: (1) the number of top-levels above the token level and (2) the unit representation for each top-level. We choose to use one top level since it is sufficiently coarser to apply full self-attention for a wide range of long document benchmarks we experimented on. A natural choice for top level units is sentence, paragraph, and chapter, depending on the number top level considered. Such a choice however might lead to complicated implementations and non-scalability due to the varying length of these units. We hence choose a simpler approach, where the top level consists of fixed-length segments of the documents. While we use a single top level, multiple top levels can be simply achieved with segments with increasingly coarser granularity.</p><p>In the top-down inference, segment-level self-attention has a complexity of O(M 2 ), and tokensegment cross-attention has a complexity of O(N M ). Thus, together with bottom-up inference, the complexity is O(N w + M 2 + N M ). In practice, we use relatively small w (window size) and M (number of segments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">POOLING METHODS</head><p>As aforementioned, we use a single top level, consisting of fixed-length segments, in the current work. The segment representations are initialized by pooling token representations. Following the notation above, suppose a document is divided into M segments, and the embedding of the jth segment is initialized as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s (0) j = k n=1 p n e j?d+n<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where k is the kernel size and d is the stride. p n is the weight for the nth token. We introduce two approaches to compute the weights. The first method is average pooling (AvgPool) and hence p n = 1. construct training labels for the importance tagger: (1) word lemmatization for document and reference words;</p><p>(2) label a document word as important if it appears in the reference word list and is a non-stopword 2. train a top-down transformer encoder with constructed labels as the importance tagger 3. train the summarization model with oracle weights (i.e., constructed labels from Step 1.) and test it with the adaptive importance weight assigned by the learned tagger</p><p>In our experiments, we also used OracleAdaPool where the weights are obtained from Step 1 with the reference summaries. Note that if {p n } k n=1 does not form a valid probability distribution, s j can be computed with a normalized weight distribution within each pooling window as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s (0) j = k n=1 exp(p n )e j?d+n k n=1 exp(p n )</formula><p>.</p><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">{s (0) j } M j=1</formula><p>are updated with self-attention, yielding {s j } M j=1 , which are then used in top-down inference for token representations, as discussed in Section 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We thoroughly evaluate the proposed framework on distinct summarization datasets. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> for a summary of datasets used in the current work. Our model is first evaluated on two standard long document summarization benchmarks, PubMed and arXiv <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohan et al., 2018)</ref>. It outperforms various efficient transformers and other approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Although we focus on long document summarization, models under our framework is also applicable to shorter documents. We test our model on CNN-Dailymail <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(See et al., 2017)</ref>, the most widely used short summarization dataset. Compared to a full self-attention model, our model achieves competitive or better performance but is more memory-and compute-efficient. Recently, a more challenging benchmark, SummScreen , is proposed, where summarization systems need to summarize TV show scripts. These documents convey plot events often indirectly and implicitly in dialogues, in contrast to news and scientific articles where statements follow a logical order and facts are offered explicitly. Moreover, a typical episode contains multiple subplots that proceed in parallel. Solving this benchmark thus requires a system to draw information from utterances spreading out through the entirety of the input and integrate them to a concise description. Our model outperforms strong baselines on this challenging benchmark by a significant margin. Another challenging dataset, BookSum <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kry?ci?ski et al., 2021)</ref>, is also recently released. It covers books from the literature domain, including stories, plays, and novels. Similar to ScreenSum, it requires integrating plot events from indirectly expressed descriptions. A further challenge is to process long-form texts up to hundreds of pages or over 100,000 words. A model under our framework does well on this challenge, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to a concurrent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wu et al., 2021)</ref> using GPT-3. While the GPT-3-based model has 175 billion parameters and requires human labelers to extensively write summaries and provide reward information, our model with 464 million parameters is 380 times smaller and merely requires training on relatively minimal data. These results suggest our framework is a generally effectively for documents of various lengths, domains.  We use the same encoder-decoder architecture for all datasets. The encoder has 8 bottom-up inference layers and 4 top-down inference layers for tokens, and 2 self-attention layers for segments. The decoder has 12 layers. The encoder layers for tokens (12 layers) and the decoder layers are all initialized from BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis et al., 2020)</ref> except the parameters for token-segment cross-attention in the top-down inference layers, which are randomly initialized. The self-attention parameters for segments are also randomly initialized. The window size is 1024 unless otherwise specified. Our settings closely follow Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lin, 2004)</ref>. Reported performance is based on the checkpoint with the best validation R-2 score. Summary samples for each dataset generated by our models are provided in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTS</head><p>We first test the effectiveness of our framework on two widely used datasets based on scientific documents, PubMed and arXiv. They consists of long documents of length ranging from several thousands of words to over ten thousands words. Each document in PubMed is a scientific article, collected from PubMed.com, and the reference summary is the associated abstract. Documents in arXiv are collected from arxiv.org. Three variants of our model with various pooling weights are presented. AvgPool, AdaPool, and OracleAdaPool in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> indicate average pooling, pooling with adaptive weights, pooling with adaptive weights determined by references, respectively.  The experiment results are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>. Pegasus  is pretrained on a large-scale of dataset with a pretraining objective specifically designed for summarization. It uses a full self-attention encoder and thus has to truncate the source document due to the quadratic memory complexity. The summarization-oriented large-scale pre-training makes it a strong baseline. Dancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gidiotis &amp; Tsoumakas, 2020</ref>) takes a divide-and-conquer approach in which the summary is divided into sections and each section is paired to the appropriate section of the document and the model is trained on short sequences and has a low memory requirement. This is a straightforward approach achieving strong performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">PubMed arXiv R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L Pegasus (568M</formula><p>TLM-I+E <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pilault et al., 2020)</ref> first extracts salient sentences and then uses a GPT-style model to generate a summary by conditioning on the introduction section and extracted sentences (instead of the whole document), thus reducing memory requirement. SSN-DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cui &amp; Hu, 2021)</ref> is an extractive model and uses a sliding encoder to process segments of a document and a memory module to capture autoregressive dependency between segments. These two models bear similarities to our model in that they use a multi-scale structure. The extracted only salient sentences in TLM-I+E can be considered a representation of the document at a coarser granularity since salient information is retained. Instead of keeping the coarser representations in the latent space, TLM-I+E reads out them to the observed word space. In SSN-DM, the fixed-size memory module pooling information from each segments can also be considered a high level representation of the document. Despite these similarities, our model, following a principled framework to synergize bottom-up and top-down inference, clearly outperforms these prior models.</p><p>BigBird <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zaheer et al., 2020)</ref>, Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>, and LSH <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kitaev et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang et al., 2021)</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Results on CNN-DailyMail. Best performance (not relying on oracle) is in bold, and the second best is underlined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SHORT DOCUMENTS</head><p>To demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed framework, we show its efficiency and effectiveness on short document summarization and compare it to full self-attention inference model. We hypothesize that although the bottom-up inference uses local self-attention (for efficiency), the top-down correction would enable the effectiveness of our inference and hence lead to competitive or better summarization performance.</p><p>Our model parameters are initialized from BART. Hence, BART with full self-attention forms a natural baseline, allowing for direct comparison. In the bottom-up inference, the local attention window size is 256. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, models under our framework achieve slightly better performance, especially in terms of R-1 and R-L, than BART. It confirms our hypothesis that a synergy of bottom-up inference with local attention and top-down inference with global attention is effective and achieves on-par or better performance as full self-attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">SUMMSCREEN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TVMegaSite</head><p>ForeverDreaming  Scientific and news articles often require that facts are offered explicitly and statements follow a logical order, which might allow summarization models to exploit layout and stylistic biases. We next test the proposed framework on a more challenging dataset, SummScreen, which requires a model to draw and integrate information from indirect expressions across a wide range of the document. SummScreen  provides two datasets, TVMegaSite and ForeverDreaming, collecting from two different TV show transcript websites. Each document is the transcript of a TV show episode and the summary is an associated recap. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> summarizes the results. Extractive oracle is an extractive method by extracting nearest neighbors based on Rouge scores. Longformer is an abstractive method and takes the whole document as input. Hybrid models first select salient sentences and then input them to BART. Our models outperform these strong baselines and even achieves comparable or superior performance than those having access to oracle information.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R-1 R-2 R-L R-1 R-2 R-L Extractive</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">BOOKSUM</head><p>BookSum <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kry?ci?ski et al., 2021)</ref> is another challenging dataset, consisting of books from the literature domain including stories, plays and novels. It includes examples on three levels of granularity with increasing difficulty: (1) paragraph-level with inputs with hundreds of words, (2) chapter-level, with inputs with several thousands or over ten thousands of words, <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>     <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2021)</ref> takes a divide-and-conquer approach to summarize chapters. They finetune BART, T5, and Pegasus on the paragraph level data and the chapter summary is obtained by concatenating the paragraph summary. This might miss the intra-paragraph context. Our models directly summarize the whole chapters and outperform these divide-and-conquer models. Efficient transformers, Longformer and BigBird, are also able to take in the whole chapters as inputs. But these bottom-up approaches clearly underperform our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">BOOK LEVEL</head><p>We first train a top-down transformer on the chapter-level data and then fine-tune it on the book-level data. The inputs to the book-level model are (1) the concatenated chapter reference summaries in training or (2) the concatenated chapter summaries generated by the chapter-level model in testing.</p><p>The chapter-to-book curriculum training is to mitigate the scarcity of book-level data. The recursive summarization of chapters and then books can be considered abstractive content selection applied to book data, and is used to address the extremely long length of books.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 6</ref> summarizes the book-level results. The middle section shows the performance for the models with the divide-and-conquer approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kry?ci?ski et al., 2021)</ref>, same as those for the chapter-level data. A concurrent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wu et al., 2021</ref>) based on GPT-3 with reinforcement learning (RL) also attempts to summarize books. Their method shares similarity with ours in that they decompose books into shorter sequences and train the model and summarize the text segments recursively. There are four major differences between our approach and theirs. First, our model has only 464 million parameters and is 380 times smaller than GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters. Second, we train our model with the limited and publicly available data from BookSum, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wu et al. (2021)</ref> requires human labelers to write summaries and give preference, which is highly costly. Third, our model has lower complexity, allowing it to takes in longer input. Thus, we only need to decompose the book one time (into chapters), in contrast to multiple recursive decomposition steps. Multiple recursive summarization steps is prone to accumulating errors. Forth, GPT-3 uses bottom-up inference to infer token representations, in contrast to the synergy of bottom-up and top-down inference in our approach, which we believe leads to better representation inference. The last two differences might account for our competitive performance using a much smaller model and less data.</p></div>

Although our model mostly follows the abstractive approach, it also has connections to the hybrid models. These models usually first extract salient sentences from the source document and then summarize the extracted sentences with an abstractive model. Extracted sentences can be viewed a high level representation of the document, although it is the observed space but not in the latent space as in our framework. A continuous representations in the latent space facilities end-to-end learning. Moreover, assigning importance weight with the importance tagger in our method resembles an extractive step in a hybrid model, and thus top down transformer with learned importance tagger can be considered a hybrid model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inference for Hierarchical Latent Variable Model</head><p>Our work draws inspiration from the latent variable inference for hierarchical top-down generative models. To faithfully infer multi-layer latent variables needs to account for the dependency between them. MCMC approaches Nijkamp et al. Efficient Transformers Despite the effectiveness of transformers on a variety of tasks, its quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length has limited its application to problems with long sequences. A large amount of works have attempted to address this limitation. A major line of work focuses on designing various sparse attention mechanisms. These works can be roughly categorized into two groups, depending on whether the sparsity pattern is content-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kitaev et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Roy et al., 2021;</ref> or content-independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Child et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beltagy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zaheer et al., 2020)</ref>. Our work is mostly related to contentindependent sparse attetntion. A main assumption of content-independent sparse attention is that the context temporally and/or spatially proximate to the query token is more important, which is intuitively sensible and supported by empirical attention analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Child et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, a common and basic sparse attention pattern is local attention, where each query token only attends to a neighborhood within a fixed temporal and/or spatial window. While this reduces the complexity to be linear, a model with only local attention cannot model long-range dependency. Prior works combine local attention with other attention patterns with wider or global receptive field such as dilated attention, random attention tokens, and global attention tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beltagy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zaheer et al., 2020)</ref>. Our models also use local attention for its efficiency and leverage top-down inference to enable global-context awareness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we propose a principled inference framework to improve latent representation inference for summarization models. It assumes a hierarchical latent structure of a document where the top-level captures the long range dependency at a coarser granularity and the bottom token level preserves the details. We leverage this hierarchical structure and synergize bottom-up inference with top-down inference to improve token representation inference. In the bottom-up pass, token representations are inferred with local self-attention to exploit its efficiency. Top-down correction is then applied to allow tokens to capture long-range dependency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a wide range of summarization datasets, including narrative, conversational, scientific documents and news. Our model achieves (1) comparable or superior performance on short documents with higher memory and compute efficiency, compared to full attention transformers, (2) state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of long document summarization benchmarks, compared to recent efficient transformers, and (3) competitive performance on summarizing whole books using 0.27% parameters and much less training data, compared to a recent GPT-3-based model. These results indicate the general applicability and benefits of the proposed framework.</p></div>

the water -solubilizing groups, and the overall charge state of the c60 vectors in gene delivery and expression, several different c60 derivatives were synthesized to yield either positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral chemical functionalities under physiological conditions. these fullerene derivatives were then tested for their ability to transfect cells grown in culture with dna carrying the green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) reporter gene. statistically significant expression of gfp was observed for all forms of the c60 derivatives when used as dna vectors and compared to the ability of naked dna alone to transfect cells. however, efficient in vitro transfection was only achieved with the two positively charged c60 derivatives, namely, an octa -amino derivatized c60 and a dodeca -amino derivatized c60 vector. all c60 vectors showed an increase in toxicity in a dose -dependent manner. increased levels of cellular toxicity were observed for positively charged c60 vectors relative to the negatively charged and neutral vectors. structural analyses using dynamic light scattering and optical microscopy offered further insights into possible correlations between the various derivatized c60 compounds, the c60 vector / dna complexes, their physical attributes ( aggregation, charge ) and their transfection efficiencies. recently, similar gd@c60 -based compounds have demonstrated potential as advanced contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ). thus, the successful demonstration of intracellular dna uptake, intracellular transport, and gene expression

we study the fluctuations of energy and dissipation in a thermostated harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external deterministic forcing. this oscillator is very well described by a second order langevin equation. using the fluctuation dissipation theorem, we obtain fluctuation relations for the work given to the system by the external torque and for the heat dissipated by the system, by writing the first principle of thermodynamics between the two steady states. from the experimental results, we derive analytical expressions for the probability density functions of the work and the dissipated heat, and for their finite time corrections, both for a forcing linear in time and a forcing sinusoidal in time. from these expressions, we present some analytical derivations of fluctuation theorems based on experimental observations. arXiv Example #2: Reference the pairing hamiltonian constitutes an important approximation in many-body systems, it is exactly soluble and

At the opening of Act I, it is a cloudy autumn day on a Russian country estate. In the garden, the old nurse Marina stands at the samovar and offers Doctor Astrov something to eat, but he refuses. He complains about the difficulty of his job. Telegin, an impoverished local landowner, sits with them. Voynitsky, known as Vanya, comes out of the house and joins them. He is almost fifty and is weary and irritable. He complains about his brother-in-law, Serebryakov, Serebryakov's young second wife, Helen, and about how their visit has turned the place upside down. Serebryakov, Helen, and Serebryakov's daughter, Sonya, join them for a moment. After they depart, Vanya sighs about Helen's beauty and then complains about how he has toiled his whole life on this estate for the professor and it has come to naught. After Vanya's sister's death, he and Sonya worked here so the professor could continue his studies and his writings, but Vanya has come to see that work as foolish and irrelevant. When Astrov suggests that Vanya is jealous, Vanya laughs that he obviously is, especially as the old, gout-and-rheumatism-ridden man seems to attract beautiful women. Helen ventures outside and tells Astrov his services are not needed for her husband. Mrs. Voynitsky, Vanya's mother and Sonya's grandmother, tells them about a new pamphlet written by a friend in Kharkov. When Vanya sneers that all they do is read pamphlets, she becomes distressed and claims he hates her. Vanya merely says he is old, tired, and frustrated. A laborer arrives and tells Astrov he is wanted at the factory; the doctor bitterly departs, but not before they all discuss how he is very interested in forestry work. Sonya speaks up cheerfully about how Astrov is trying to save the old forest from destruction because forests make people happier. Astrov speaks of how Russians have torn down the forests and destroyed the wildlife: they no longer create, but rather destroy. After Sonya walks Astrov out, Vanya tries to seduce Helen, but she pushes him away. She muses about how Sonya clearly seems to love the doctor but he does not love her back. Helen sighs that she is simply bored and life is too much for her. In Act II, Serebryakov complains to Helen of how he is old and no one respects him. His querulous behavior only annoys Helen, who begs him to stop it. Serebryakov ignores her and bemoans how his life of scholarship seems to be nothing now. Sonya joins them and tells them Serebryakov must see Astrov now; she wants her father to stop behaving like a child. The elderly nurse Marina comforts Serebryakov and leads him out. Helen tells Vanya, who entered the room, that her husband wearies her. Vanya can only lament that everything is over for him and his life was wasted on trivial things. Helen is annoyed and moves to leave, but he bars her way. She accuses him of being drunk, and he admits to it. After Helen sweeps out of the room, Vanya ruminates on what a fool he was not to fall in love with her when she was younger; he once admired the professor, but now he does not. When Astrov returns, he mocks Vanya for having feelings for Helen, but Vanya will not admit it. Astrov leaves to get a drink; Sonya pulls him aside and makes him promise to stop drinking and stop getting her uncle drunk. He agrees. They continue to talk for a moment. He comments that Helen is beautiful but idle and useless. This country life makes people like that, and he despises it; he has been beaten down and sees no light at the end for himself. The peasants are all the same, and educated people are ridiculous. He only likes forests. Sonya compliments him and tries to cheer him up. As he prepares to leave, she asks how he might feel if he were to out that a friend of hers has feelings for him, and he drolly says he cannot love anyone. After he leaves, Sonya feels a surge of happiness though she is not sure why. In Act III, Sonya confesses to Helen that she loves Astrov, and Helen suggests that she say something to see if the doctor loves Sonya too. Sonya gives her permission for Helen to do this. Astrov and Helen meet to ostensibly look at his forestry maps. He discourses volubly on the patterns of deforestation until he sees that Helen is uninterested. Helen insists she is interested but says they should talk about something else. She point-blank asks if he likes Sonya, and he says no. He then moves in to seduce Helen, but she wants none of it. As he tries to kiss her, Vanya enters the room with flowers. Helen is horrified by the situation and begs Vanya to tell her husband that they must leave today. A moment later, Serebryakov and the others enter and Serebryakov announces that he has an idea to sell the estate because he and Helen need to afford a place in the city. This announcement angers Vanya tremendously, and he begins to complain violently about how Serebryakov is a fraud, is uninspired, is thankless, and how he, Vanya, has labored for Serebryakov his whole life and for no reason. He insists this is Sonya's estate. He runs out of the room. Serebryakov is startled by Vanya's outburst. He insists he cannot stay here anymore. Sonya implores him to talk to her uncle and he agrees. He departs, and those in the room hear a gunshot, then another. Helen and Vanya struggle over a revolver as Vanya screeches that he missed the professor. Cursing, he sinks into a chair. In Act IV, Telegin and Marina discuss Serebryakov and Helen's planned departure for that day, then exit the room. Vanya and Astrov come in. Astrov mocks Vanya for his behavior and asks him to return what he stole. Vanya maintains that he is innocent of theft. Astrov laments how this parochial existence crushes people: it is stultifying and useless. When Sonya enters Astrov tells her to tell her uncle to return the bottle of morphia he stole. Sonya turns to her uncle and tearfully asks him for the bottle. He complies. She takes him to make up with her father. Helen enters to tell Astrov goodbye. He tries to seduce her again in a rather lackluster fashion; she kisses him and bids him farewell. Everyone bids goodbye to Serebryakov and Helen, who leave the estate. Sonya and Vanya return to work. Marina suggests Astrov stay for dinner; he refuses and says he must be off. Astrov leaves, and even though Sonya knows he did not love her, she is sad. Vanya, though, claims he is extremely depressed. With both in tears, Sonya comforts her uncle. She tells him that life may be difficult for them now, but the afterlife will be full of peace, love, and rest.</p></div>

He then sat down and closed his eyes for a while and wondered if he had killed the man. He wonders if the future generations will forget him, but he is sure that they will not. Ivan tells them that the house is a mess, because the Professor has been up all night writing and doesn't have time to eat or drink. He asks them to wake him up at two in the morning, but when they do not wake him, he thinks that the Professor wants some tea. They all come in from their walk, and as they come in, they talk about how happy they are to be together, and how they are all living in peace and contentment. Ivan is struck by the sight of a beautiful woman, and says that as he looks at her, his heart swells with unbridled happiness. The work of preserving the forest is thrilling, he says, and Dr. Astroff watches over the old woods and sets out new plantations every year. He wants to show them to Helena and Sonia, and Helena asks him if he finds it interesting. Helena is sitting next to him, and tells him to look for Batushka's works in the library the next day. He is worried that he is getting angina from his old age. Helena tries to tell him to make peace with himself, and to stop being so angry with everyone else. But he says he will not listen to her, because he has spent too much time thinking about the past, and now he cannot bear to watch the success of others and to fear death. Helena gets up and walks away from him, sitting down at a distance. She tries to get him to tell her why he doesn't love anyone. He says he is not an idiot, that he can understand her, but that he cannot understand her because she is young and healthy and beautiful and longing for life and he is an old dotard, almost a dead man. She tells him that she can understand him and that he should be able to understand her. Now, she says, she is too old and sick to continue to live in the country, and she has a young daughter and a young wife to care for. She doesn't want to live on the income generated by the estate, so they have to find some way to guarantee that they can live in town on the money generated each year. They decide to sell the woods, because they don't have enough money to do so every year, and they can't afford to buy the woods every year either. They need to find a way to make sure they can afford a certain amount of money to buy a cottage in Finland. They also have to figure out what to do with the rest of the property. The estate is worth ninety-five thousand roubles, and the estate was bought from his uncle, who had a debt of twenty-five. Semyon Lakedemonoff's brother bought the estate from the Lakedemons' uncle. The family ties are what got the estate to be worth so much money. Everyone agrees that the estate is for Sonia's good, and that she should get to keep it. But now that he has gotten old and ill, the time has come for him to dispose of his property in regard to the interests of his VOITSKI, ASTROFF, SEREBRAKOFF, Vanya, and SONIA arrive at the house to say goodbye to Tommo and Marina. They are to move to Kharkov to live with the professor and his wife. They have been frightened by what they have just witnessed, and decide to go to the city to see if they can find a place to live there. They will not be staying in the village any longer. Except for Vanya and Alexander, who stay to say good-bye to his wife and son-in-law. The Professor kisses them all three times, and then goes out to see them off. He gives them one last kiss to each of them before he leaves. They say they will always remember each other with pleasure, that they are interesting and original, and original. They shall rest <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref>: Summary Samples for BookSum Book-Level B ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT DETAILS Due to the space limit, additional experiment details are reported here. As we discussed in the main text, all of our models are initialized from BART Large with 12 layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis et al., 2020)</ref>. In the bottom-up inference module (the left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), the local self-attention in our models has 8 layers and all parameters are initialized from the first 8 layers of BART (including parameters for layer normalization). We use 4 layers for top-down inference (the middle panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Each layer consists of (1) token local self-attention, (2) token-segment cross-attention, and (3) feedforward. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> are initialized from the last 4 layers of BART (including parameters for layer normalization). All other parameters are randomly initialized. The segment-pooling has a kernel size of 32 and a stride size of 24. The maximum document lengths for PubMed, arXiv, <ref type="bibr">CNN-DM, TVMegaSite, ForeverDreaming, BookSum are 8192, 16384, 1024, 12288, 12288, 12288, respectively.</ref> B.1 LOCAL SELF-ATTENTION The local self-attention used in our work is widely used in prior works on sparse attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beltagy et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zaheer et al., 2020)</ref>. It is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. It shows local self-attention of 9 tokens with window size 4. Each token attends 2 tokens on the left and 2 tokens on the right, as long as there are sufficient right and left neighbors. The attended nearby tokens are in light green. Each token also attends itself, as indicated by dark green. White color in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> indicates absence of attention.</p><p>It is also called sliding window attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>. We call it local self-attention to make a direct contrast with the full self-attention used for the segment-level representations. Despite its efficiency, it misses information outside of the local attention window. Thus, it is often used together with other attention mechanisms. In Longformer, sliding window attention is combined with dilated sliding window attention and global token attention. In BigBird, it is combined with random attention and global token attention. In our work, we use segment-level tokens to collect long range information which is then used to enrich token-level representations through token-segment cross attention (see top-down inference in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: An illustration of local self-attention. It illustrates local self-attention of 9 tokens with window size 4. Each token attends 2 tokens on the left and 2 tokens on the right, as long as there are sufficient right and left neighbors. The attended nearby tokens are in light green. Each token also attends itself, as indicated by dark green. White color indicates absence of attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C ABLATION STUDIES</head><p>We present results for a series of ablation studies in this section. The experiments are performed with PubMed. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 14</ref>. The first row shows the performance of the top-down transformer with top-down update via cross-attention and window size 1024, which is our final model (Please see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for an illustration).</p><p>The second row shows the performance for a variant of top-down update. In this variant, to update the bottom-up inferred token representations, we concatenate the token representations with the corresponding top-level segment representations, in contrast to the cross-attention approach used in the final model. We can see a clear performance degradation, indicating the importance of the cross-attention-based top-down update.</p><p>The third row displays the results without top-down update, and the decoder attends the bottom-upinferred token representations to generate summaries. Compared to our final model, the performance is also degraded, suggesting the effectiveness of the top-down update.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 14</ref> presents ablation results on the window size of local self-attention (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for an illustration). These results are also plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. They show an effect of window size. That is, as the window size increases, the performance on all metrics enhances. The effect is quite large when the window size is increased from 32 to 256. The effect becomes smaller after 256, but the model performance can still benefit from larger window size.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>An overview of the top-down transformer. Suppose a document with 7 tokens is the inputs to the model, as shown on the bottom left. The bottom-up inference is achieved with local self-attention (N1 layers) as shown in the left panel. To initialize the top-level representations, we pool bottom-up-inferred token representations with either equal weights or adaptive weights (see Section 2.3 for details). Top-level representations are then updated with full self-attention (N2 layers) to capture global context. They are then used to update bottomup-inferred token representations, accounting for the top-down update for token representations, as shown in the middle panel. The final token representations are attended by the decoder to generate a summary. Note that inference is used in the sense of statistical inference for latent variables and does not imply no training.</figDesc></figure>

(2016); Maal?e et al. (2019); Child (2020) makes a special design to capture the multi-layer dependency. In particular, in a bottom-up path, the parameters of the distribution of higher level variables are computed as a function of the lower level variables; in a top-down path, the parameters of the distribution of lower level variables are corrected as a function of the higher level variables.</figDesc></figure>

		<title level="a" type="main">To his surprise, the portrait shows marks of cruelty around the mouth, lines that do not show on Dorian&apos;s face. He begins to suspect that his wish is coming true, so he vows to be good so that both he and the portrait can remain young. He, therefore, intends to apologize to Sibyl the next day and makes to marry her after all. However, he is too late: Sibyl commits suicide at the theatre that night. Dorian first feels responsibility for her death, but then views it both as wonderful entertainment and a selfish act on her part. Lord Henry tries to keep Dorian&apos;s name out of the scandal. Dorian and Lord Henry spend the evening at the opera. The next morning, Basil arrives and expresses concern for Dorian, given the events of the previous day. Dorian, however, is completely unconcerned about Sibyl or her family; he wants to talk only of happy subjects. The next day, he covers his portrait and moves it to the attic, to which Dorian has the only key. He then settles in to read a yellow book sent by Lord Henry; the book becomes Dorian&apos;s blackprint for life. Several years pass, and Dorian lives a hedonistic life according to the guidelines established by Lord Henry and the yellow book. While the face in the portrait has turned ugly, Dorian remains young, beautiful, and innocent. People talk about Dorian&apos;s &quot;madness of pleasure&quot; and his dreadful influence on the people around him, but that is of no consequence to him. Finally, when he is thirty-eight years old, Dorian shows the portrait to Basil, who begs Dorian to repent of his sin and ask that the wish be revoked. Instead, Dorian kills Basil and hides his body. Blackmailing his old friend Alan Campbell, Dorian is able to dispose of Basil&apos;s body. An hour later, Dorian attends a party, but is bored and distracted. He then heads for an opium den and, out on the street, meets Sibyl&apos;s younger brother, who has been waiting for an opportunity to harm Dorian for nearly twenty years. Dorian makes a case for mistaken identity when he claims to have the face of a twenty-year-old and cannot be the man James is looking for. A woman in the street reveals that Dorian &quot;sold himself to the devil for a pretty face</title>

		<title level="a" type="main">He runs into a dark alley and is suddenly grabbed by a man with a gun pointed at his head. It is James Vane. Vane threatens to kill Dorian if he doesn&apos;t make peace with God. He gives Dorian one minute to make his peace before he kills him. When Dorian gets to the street, he finds that the man he was trying to kill is not the same man he thought he was. It turns out that Vane is twenty-eight years younger than Dorian. The woman who took his money tells him not to talk to her again. She runs off, and when Dorian looks back, the woman has disappeared. When he wakes up the next morning, he has not had a nightmare. He writes two letters to his assistant, Alan Campbell, telling him that there is a dead man sitting on a table in his house, and that he must destroy the body so that no one will ever know who he is. He then goes to his bedroom and finds a small box of lacquer, which he takes out and puts inside. He puts the box back, gets into a horse-drawn carriage, and gives the driver an address. The driver takes him to the address, and as he is leaving the house, he sees the dead body of a man on the table. When Campbell returns, he tells Alan not to disturb the body, but to come back at seven o&apos;clock in the evening. When the man arrives, he throws the picture over the table, but Dorian does not believe that it has been disturbed. He returns home and finds that Campbell has brought back the chemicals and the irons, and the other things that he needs to do the job. He opens the cabinet where he had hidden Basil&apos;s coat and bag</title>
