<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most existing dialogue systems fail to respond properly to potentially unsafe user utterances by either ignoring or passively agreeing with them. To address this issue, we introduce PROSOCIALDIALOG, the first large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset to teach conversational agents to respond to problematic content following social norms. Covering diverse unethical, problematic, biased, and toxic situations, PROSOCIALDIALOG contains responses that encourage prosocial behavior, grounded in commonsense social rules (i.e., rules-ofthumb, RoTs). Created via a human-AI collaborative framework, PROSOCIALDIALOG consists of 58K dialogues, with 331K utterances, 160K unique RoTs, and 497K dialogue safety labels accompanied by free-form rationales.</p><p>With this dataset, we introduce a dialogue safety detection module, Canary, capable of generating RoTs given conversational context, and a socially-informed dialogue agent, Prost. Empirical results show that Prost generates more socially acceptable dialogues compared to other state-of-the-art language and dialogue models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Additionally, Canary effectively guides off-the-shelf language models to generate significantly more prosocial responses. Our work highlights the promise and importance of creating and steering conversational AI to be socially responsible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>State-of-the-art data-driven conversational AI systems are at the risk of producing or agreeing with unsafe (i.e., toxic, unethical, rude, or dangerous) content. For example, given the potentially problematic utterance "I saw someone overdose and didn't tell anyone", <ref type="bibr">GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)</ref>, BlenderBot <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Roller et al., 2021)</ref>, and OPT (Zhang * denotes equal contribution <ref type="bibr">et al., 2022)</ref> all condone this behavior <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a</ref>). Such overly agreeable characteristics of conversational systems come from their exposure to predominantly positive or agreeable training data <ref type="bibr">(Baheti et al., 2021;</ref>. Although such design choice can uplift user-bot interaction experiences, lacking appropriate strategies to cope with problematic contexts poses serious safety concerns for real-world deployment of conversational AIs <ref type="bibr">(Dinan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Weidinger et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>To mitigate such risk, previous works have primarily focused on dialogue safety detection <ref type="bibr">(Dinan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sun et al., 2022)</ref>, and adopted mechanical strategies to avoid potentially unsafe conversational content altogether <ref type="bibr">(Xu et al., 2021, e.g</ref>., giving canned responses, "Do you want to talk about something else?"). However, such evasive strategies disturb the flow of conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stuart-Ulin, 2018)</ref>. Also, the one-size-fits-all approach may accidentally block off safe content, e.g., conversations about gender or race issues, leading to social exclusion and marginalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Young, 2014)</ref>. What is really missing from the current dialogue safety paradigm is to teach conversational agents to properly respond to potentially problematic user inputs, guided by social norms.</p><p>As a significant step towards creating socially responsible conversational agents, we introduce PROSOCIALDIALOG, 1 a large-scale dataset of 58K multi-turn conversations in which a speaker responds to potentially unsafe situations prosocially -i.e., following social norms and benefiting others or society <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Twenge et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Collins, 2022)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>, our dialogues start with a speaker bringing up potentially unsafe content (e.g., neglecting overdosing; utterance 1). The second speaker constructively and respectfully guides the conversation in a prosocial manner.</p><p>First of all, that must have been a terrifying situation. It was your responsibility to help the person in need though. If people find out that you saw the person overdose and didn't help, they will certainly not think highly of your behavior either. I don't think it's too much to ask to call 911 if you watch someone overdose on something. It's really important to look out for others by doing things like that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oh no, why didn't you tell someone about it?</head><p>Rules-of-thumb You shouldn't let someone overdose without telling anyone.</p><p>I hate junkies. After all, they're all just criminals, aren't they? Needs Caution ? Rules-of-thumb You should call 911 if you see someone overdosed. You should look out for others.</p><p>Right, they would think I'm a terrible person. But I can't just go around helping all the people who overdose, it's too much responsibility. I saw someone overdose and didn't tell anyone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rules-of-thumb</head><p>It's important to help others in need.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Needs Caution</head><p>? That must have been really difficult to witness. I'm glad you made the decision to not tell anyone about what you saw.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GPT-3</head><p>Well, it sounds like you did the right thing. I am glad you were there for them.  <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Roller et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zhang et al., 2022)</ref> to a problematic context. (b) An example dialogue from PROSOCIALDIALOG. At each turn, the task is to (1) first determine dialogue safety labels ( ?3.3), (2) then infer relevant rules-of-Thumb (RoTs) for problematic contexts, and (3) finally generate constructive feedback based on RoTs ( ?3.2).</p><p>We operationalize this prosocial intent with commonsense social rules or rules-of-thumb (RoTs), as responses should be grounded in communicative intents or goals <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Brennan, 1991)</ref>. For example, utterance 6 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref> is grounded in the prosocial intent to remind the other of the social responsibility, "You should look out for others."</p><p>To create PROSOCIALDIALOG, we set up a human-AI collaborative data creation framework <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2)</ref>, where GPT-3 generates the potentially unsafe utterances, and crowdworkers provide prosocial responses to them. This approach allows us to circumvent two substantial challenges: (1) there are no available large-scale corpora of multiturn prosocial conversations between humans, and (2) asking humans to write unethical, toxic, or problematic utterances could result in psychological harms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Roberts, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Steiger et al., 2021)</ref>. PROSOCIALDIALOG enables two critical tasks for building socially responsible conversational AI:</p><p>(1) generating prosocial responses to potentially unsafe user inputs; (2) detecting potentially unsafe dialogue contents with more fine-grained categorizations and grounded reasoning via RoTs. In accordance with these two goals, we additionally release a dialogue model Prost and a rules-of-thumb generator model Canary that can be used as a dialogue safety module. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that Prost generates more appropriate responses than other state-of-the-art language and dialogue models when facing problematic contexts ( ?5.2 and ?6.1). Empirical results also demonstrate that Canary effectively guides large-scale pre-trained language models to generate significantly more prosocial responses under zero-shot settings ( ?6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Prosociality and Receptiveness in Conversational Agents</head><p>We tackle the challenges of designing a chatbot that can respond prosocially, safely, and ethically to problematic inputs by incorporating three different perspectives: introducing prosocial responses controlled by rules-of-thumb ( ?2.1), improving receptiveness in dialogues using insights from social sciences ( ?2.2), and developing more fine-grained and inclusive safety labeling schema ( ?2.3). Then, we discuss some implications of modeling prosociality via social norms ( ?2.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Prosocial Responses with Rules-of-thumb</head><p>To handle problematic conversations head-on, we introduce the concept of prosociality for conversational agents. Prosocial behavior is a critical component in building relationships and supporting our society (Baumeister and Bushman, 2017). It is defined as actions that benefit others or society in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Twenge et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Collins, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>According to social psychology, helping others and following societal norms are some of the fundamental forms of prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr">(Batson and Powell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Baumeister and Bushman, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We argue that conversational agents should encourage prosocial behavior by giving constructive feedback in the face of unethical, rude, toxic, or dangerous contexts. Specifically, agents should infer appropriate social rules for those contexts and guide the other to follow them. Also, to build universally prosocial agents, they should be adaptive to new social rules as they can differ across cultures and time <ref type="bibr">(Haidt et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bloom, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In our dataset, constructive feedback is grounded both on rules-of-thumb (yellow square boxes in Figure 1) and dialogue context. As a result, dialogue agents are expected to customize their feedback accordingly when given new rules-of-thumb even after once it's trained on the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Improving Receptiveness in Dialogues</head><p>The second goal of PROSOCIALDIALOG is to respond in ways that encourage receptiveness from the interlocutor, i.e., encourages them to adjust their behavior towards prosociality. Drawing from psychology and communication studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yeomans et al., 2020)</ref>, we implement three strategies when designing PROSOCIALDIALOG: (1) Ask questions first: instead of aggressive and immediate confrontation, it is better to inquire first to give the impression of interest <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017)</ref>. (2) Base feedback on empathy: when pushing back, recent experiments show that combining empathy is the most effective among those in reducing offensive speech <ref type="bibr">(Hangartner et al., 2021)</ref>. (3) Show how to change: constructive feedback suggests better alternatives rather than just criticizing <ref type="bibr">(Hattie and Timperley, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Fine-grained and Inclusive Safety Labeling</head><p>Since PROSOCIALDIALOG deals with a wide range of situations, from benign to very problematic, we introduce a new three-way safety classification schema: (1) Needs Caution, (2) Needs Intervention, and (3) Casual. While previous work aims to classify the safety or toxicity of context itself <ref type="bibr">(Dinan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Thoppilan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sun et al., 2022)</ref>, our schema focuses on the actions or responses an agent should produce next. We do so in order to avoid flagging specific or sensitive content as "unsafe" (e.g., discussions of minority identity), as this can lead to stigmatization and social exclusion of minority users <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Silver, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Young, 2014)</ref>. Needs Caution describes utterances and situations that are potentially problematic, unethical, rude, toxic, or biased and may require caution in order to respond prosocially.</p><p>Needs Intervention captures contexts that are more than just problematic but instead require human intervention (i.e., prosocial action), such as medical issues or imminent danger. In those cases, it is more appropriate or even required to seek help from real humans (e.g., calling 911) beyond just receiving responses.</p><p>Casual covers the remaining non-problematic situations, such as casual everyday actions, chitchat, and positive or empathetic interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Whose Prosociality Is It Anyway?</head><p>Although crowdsourcing has been the primary method of data collection for AI, we recognize that relying on the wisdom of the crowd is not equivalent to moral correctness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Talat et al., 2021)</ref>. In fact, our operationalization of social norms, toxicity, and dialogue safety may privilege majority or dominant opinions, at the expense of minority or marginalized ones. This a particularly important consideration, as historically, dominant normative values have been used to justify oppression of minority groups <ref type="bibr">(Hoover et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To mitigate these negative effects, we release the individual safety annotations, to keep annotation diversity, and we employ the Social Bias Inference Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sap et al., 2020)</ref> to push back against statements perpetuating oppression of marginalized identities (e.g., with RoTs such as "it's wrong to think people of color are inferior"). However, future work should investigate the effect of our design decisions on marginalized groups, and investigate methods for better shifting power to those groups. For further discussion, please see ?9 and ?10.  sists of three stages: (1) determining the safety of context, (2) reasoning rules-of-thumb for problematic dialogue contexts, (3) and generating guiding responses grounded on those rules-of-thumb. Here, we go over the data collection steps of our dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Collecting Problematic Situations</head><p>To cover a wide range of problematic dialogue contexts, we collect unethical, biased, and harmful situations for conversation openers from three moralityrelated English datasets: Social Chemistry (Forbes et al., 2020), <ref type="bibr">ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021)</ref>, and Social Bias Inference Corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sap et al., 2020)</ref>. Further details can be found in Appendix A.1. Social Chemistry includes various single-sentence social situations along with relevant social norms in text, denoted as rules-of-thumb (RoTs). We filter the situations and RoTs suitable for dyadic dialogue; and related to potentially wrong behaviors (e.g., situation: "hoping to spam others", RoT: "It's bad to intentionally disrupt others."). ETHICS is a benchmark for assessing language models' basic knowledge of ethical judgments. We use the commonsense morality subset that contains short text scenarios (1-2 sentences) in everyday life (e.g., "I shoved the kids into the street during traffic."). We extract ones labeled as being wrong. Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) is a corpus of toxic and stereotypical posts annotated with toxicity labels and text explanations of implied social biases. We extract the posts and implications about minorities (e.g., post: "Do you expect a man to do cooking cleaning and washing?", implication: "Women should do the house chores."). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the overall human-AI data annotation pipeline. More details and example annotation pages can be found in Appendix A.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Collecting Dialogues</head><p>Drafting Dialogue Openings. We use GPT-3 to draft the first three utterances of the dialogue, by prompting it with examples to play the roles of a problematic and an inquisitive speaker. Crowdworkers later revise these utterances.</p><p>The first utterance comes from the set of collected problematic situations described above. We prompt GPT-3 with examples to convert them to utterances (e.g., "not getting treatment for my sick child" ? "I'm not going to get treatment for my sick child"). The second utterance is a rephrased elaboration question for reflective listening <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Rogers, 1946)</ref> and the third utterance is the response. As we ground GPT-3 on the problematic first utterance, it successfully continues producing problematic content <ref type="bibr">(Gehman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Collecting Constructive Feedback. We then ask human annotators to continue the conversation by giving constructive feedback grounded on rulesof-thumb (RoTs).</p><p>(i) Select or write RoTs. Workers can select one or two RoTs from a set of candidates, or write their own. Candidates are either the RoTs associated with the original input situation from our problematic datasets or machine-generated. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> (ii) Write constructive feedback. Next, we ask them to guide the interlocutor to be more prosocial aligned with the RoTs. We give careful instructions to help workers write better responses. If workers cannot find any problematic behavior in the context, they respond freely without grounding in RoTs.</p><p>Continuing the Conversation. After collecting the feedback responses, we generate another round of dialogue with GPT-3, for which we then collect another round of feedback from crowdworkers. We collect at most six turns of dialogue.</p><p>Proofreading for Coherency and Soundness. For each round, the worker annotating the RoTs and feedback also determines whether the previous responses are appropriate and the overall context is coherent. We ask workers to revise at least one utterance for each dialogue.</p><p>Validating the Collected Dialogues. We run two separate rounds of validation after collecting the dialogues. We ask three workers per dialogue to report any incoherent utterances or accusatory/harsh/rude feedback. We re-annotate dialogues if they are reported by one or more workers to ensure data quality. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Collecting Dialogue Safety Labels</head><p>As a final step, we collect dialogue safety labels to determine when the agent should give constructive feedback. Given a dialogue context, we ask three annotators to categorize the utterance(s) by the machine interlocutor (i.e., GPT-3) into three classes: CASUAL, NEEDS CAUTION, and NEEDS INTERVENTION (see details in ?2.3). We also ask workers to write a one-sentence rationale for their judgment, in order to enrich our annotations with explanations of why something might need caution (e.g., "Speaker doesn't have a good reason for borrowing the car and disappearing."). Unfortunately, classification labels wash away the implications behind the decisions. Hence, these rationales are not only valuable by themselves but also lead to better credibility and transparency for evaluating the annotations <ref type="bibr">(Kutlu et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>When creating our final context label, we aim to preserve annotator disagreements, which often arise in such subjective annotations <ref type="bibr">(Dinan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Sap et al., 2022)</ref>. Our final label set is: (1) CASUAL, (2) POSSIBLY NEEDS CAUTION, (3) PROBABLY NEEDS CAUTION, (4) NEEDS CAU-TION, and (5) NEEDS INTERVENTION. Further details and annotation pages are in Appendix A.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Analysis of PROSOCIALDIALOG</head><p>Large-scale. The dataset contains 58,137 dialogues with 331,362 utterances, 160,295 unique RoTs, 497,043 safety annotations and reasons (Table 1). The safety labels have good agreement (Krippendorff's ?=0.49; Krippendorff, 2011), with 42% of utterances labeled as Needs Caution (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> for a full breakdown  Compared to other safety datasets such as Buildit Break-it Fix-it (60K; Dinan et al., 2019), Bot-Adversarial Dialogue (79K; , and DiaSafety (11K; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sun et al., 2022)</ref>, our dataset offers a much larger set of utterances (166K) each annotated by three workers with rationales behind judgments in free-form text.</p><p>Rich in Negativity. PROSOCIALDIALOG includes a rich suite of constructive feedback countering problematic dialogue content compared to other dialogue datasets. To illustrate this, we analyze the polarity of utterances in our and other existing datasets, using the BERT-based GoEmotions sentiment classifier <ref type="bibr">(Demszky et al., 2020)</ref>. We categorize the utterances in each training dataset into four classes: positive, ambiguous, negative, and neutral. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, we show that existing datasets are predominantly agreeable in tone and largely lack negativity in their utterances, in constrast to our PROSOCIALDIALOG.</p><p>Dynamic safety labels. Our dataset provides dynamically changing safety labels across conversation turns (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Dialogues that start out with casual remarks can even end up in situations needing intervention. In contrast, we do not find NEEDS INTERVENTION contexts change to the CA-SUAL level. This is because we instruct workers that situations requiring human intervention cannot be resolved by chatbot responses. Meanwhile, we find some situations requiring caution de-escalate to the CASUAL level. This is the case where the interlocutor accepts the feedback or admits its misbehavior and promises to behave nicely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Building Socially Responsible Dialogue Agents with PROSOCIALDIALOG</head><p>We aim to build prosocial models that can reason properly in both casual and problematic conversational contexts. We utilize PROSOCIALDIALOG and other dialogue datasets to train a narrative safety module Canary and a dialogue agent Prost. By separating the two, we can update the safety module instead of retraining the entire dialogue agent when social norms or safety criteria change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Canary: A Dialogue Safety Detection Model Generating RoTs</head><p>We train a sequence-to-sequence model Canary 4 that generates both safety label and relevant RoTs given a potentially problematic dialogue context. In contrast to simple binary safety classification, generating RoTs for dialogue safety has two advantages. First, RoTs can help us better explain what is problematic within the context. Second, it allows us to ground the agent's response on RoTs, which captures the prosocial communicative intent. Training. Given a dialogue context (c), we train Canary to generate the safety label (s) along with the RoTs (r): p(s, r|c). We concatenate a special token for the safety label and RoTs to construct the target gold text for generation (e.g., __needs_caution__ It is wrong to call 911 just for fun.).

Existing dialogue datasets' utterances are excessively positive (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>) and our PROSOCIALDIALOG is deliberately designed to include much more negative responses for objectionable contexts. Therefore, it is important to incorporate them all to obtain a well-balanced dialogue agent for navigating diverse contexts. We train our agent to generate guiding utterances grounded on RoTs for contexts against social norms; otherwise, we train it to generate responses without RoTs.</p><p>We build Prost on top of the PushShift Transformer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Roller et al., 2021)</ref> which is the best publicly available pre-trained model for dialogue and also the base model for BlenderBot <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Roller et al., 2021)</ref>.

As an additional baseline, we also evaluate generations when given the gold RoTs (gold RoT &amp; Response).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Generalizing to Real-world Toxic Phrases</head><p>We show that Prost can generalize to unseen realworld, human-written toxic phrases, in addition to properly responding to the in-domain problematic content from PROSOCIALDIALOG. We evaluate Prost and other dialogue agents on how they respond to utterances from Reddit in ToxiChat <ref type="bibr">(Baheti et al., 2021)</ref>. Details are in Appendix D.1.</p><p>Baselines. We compare our two Prost models ( ?4.2) with five best-performing conversational agents: DialoGPT, BlenderBot 1, BlenderBot 2 (Komeili et al., 2021), GPT-3, and Instruct  Evaluation metrics. We report the stance, offensiveness, and toxicity of models' responses following <ref type="bibr">Baheti et al. (2021)</ref>. First, the stance classifier categorizes each response with three classes: disagree, agree, and neutral. Then, the responses' offensiveness is predicted by a binary classifier. We also determine whether responses contain bad (i.e., toxic) n-grams from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhou et al. (2021b)</ref>.</p><p>Results. Shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>, both Prost produce more disagreeing responses compared to other models. In contrast, BlenderBot 1 and GPT-3 have much higher rates of responses that agree with toxic content, compared to Prost and others.</p><p>Interestingly, Prost (RoT &amp; Response) generates more toxic words or offensive responses, com-  pared to Prost (Response). Likely, this is due to responses and RoTs that disapprove of offensive implications (e.g., "It's not right to think gays are animals"), since we also find that model disagrees the most. 8 Those disagreeing responses can be mistaken as offensive by neural models due to spurious lexical correlations and a lack of understanding of negations <ref type="bibr">(Hosseini et al., 2021)</ref>. We also observe that upgraded models (i.e., BlenderBot 2 and Instruct GPT-3) output much more neutral responses (95.3% and 90%, respectively) compared to previous versions (i.e., Blender-Bot 1 and GPT-3; 61.8% and 70.2%, respectively). However, neutral responses can still be harmful compared to disagreeing ones, especially in the face of toxicity, since it can be perceived as condoning the unacceptable behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Improving Prosociality of Pre-trained Language Models with Canary</head><p>We further demonstrate the usefulness of PROSO-CIALDIALOG by showing that Canary-generated RoTs can steer large pre-trained language models (PLMs) towards prosocial responses. Specifically, we sample 600 dialogues from the PROSOCIAL-DIALOG test set that Canary predicts not to be CASUAL and evaluate PLM responses with and without the RoTs from Canary. Target models and metrics. We apply Canary to GPT-3 and Instruct GPT-3. We append the RoTs to the prompt that is given to the PLMs along with the dialogue context (see Appendix D.2 for details). We run head-to-head human evaluations between PLMs with and without Canary, as done in ?5.2.</p><p>Results. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, responses with Canary are strongly preferred over those with-out Canary (?2 ? 3 on prosociality and overall). The pattern is similar for all other dimensions, where the responses with Canary RoTs are better or as good as responses without the RoTs. This suggests that when guided with social norms and RoTs, PLMs can be effectively steered towards behaving more prosocially.</p><p>Going one step further, we also compare responses between GPT-3 and Instruct GPT-3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 6)</ref>. As expected, Instruct GPT-3 outperforms GPT-3 in all five criteria. However, when GPT-3 is equipped with Canary, we observe it is on par with Instruct GPT-3 on overall and even better on prosociality. Although Instruct GPT-3 has undergone much more additional training than <ref type="bibr">GPT-3 (Ouyang et al., 2022)</ref>, Canary can effectively close the gap between the two models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Most existing dialogue safety work has focused on detecting problematic contexts, often using binary or ternary labels (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dinan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Baheti et al.

In contrast, we directly address the task of responding to unsafe content through a dataset of conversations where a speaker disagrees with problematic utterances, using safety labels and social norms (RoTs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale multi-turn dialogue dataset focusing on prosocial feedback to unethical and toxic contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced PROSOCIALDIALOG, a large-scale English dialogue dataset providing constructive feedback for prosocial behaviors aligned with commonsense social rules (i.e., rules-of-thumb) across diverse problematic contexts. We proposed a new three-tier dialogue safety schema to differentiate  situations requiring human intervention (e.g., emergency) from those requiring careful responses (e.g., biased, unethical). Experiments showed Prost, dialogue agent trained on our dataset, can navigate problematic contexts in a more prosocial manner. We also trained a dialogue safety model Canary that outputs relevant rules-of-thumb when the context is detected to be not casual. Human evaluation showed Canary can significantly improve the prosociality and overall quality of large language models' responses to objectionable contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precautions taken during dataset construction.</head><p>Since PROSOCIALDIALOG aims to include various problematic contexts, we take extensive safety precautions to protect our workers from possible psychological harms. Although we leverage GPT-3 to generate the problematic utterances, simply being exposed to them for annotating constructive feedback can be disturbing and upsetting for workers. Therefore, we only allow workers who are not minors. We inform in advance that worker's discretion is strongly recommended due to the offensive and upsetting contents of the annotation. Also, we notify workers they are welcome to return any data that makes them feel uncomfortable. In case of possible mental health problems, we guide workers to reach out to Crisis Text Line, 9 i.e., an organization providing free, 24/7, high-quality text-based mental health support. In addition, we keep a feedback window open on the annotation page so that workers can contact us anytime. Responses to the workers' feedback were given within 24 hours. Last but not least, we compensate our workers with competitive wages: approximately 15$ per hour on average.</p><p>This study was conducted under the approval of our institution's ethics board (IRB).</p><p>Risk factors from dataset release. Although we train our dialogue agent only on the guiding speaker role in PROSOCIALDIALOG, the problematic interlocutor's utterances can also be used as training targets. Such misuse of our dataset can result in an agent that specifically generates disturbing, troublesome, or dangerous utterances. However, conversational agents must be aware of those utterances as input in order to navigate them according to social rules. Thus, it is crucial to release the resource to the public to encourage the machine dialogue field to collectively progress towards prosocial conversational agents.</p><p>Since our dataset's rules-of-thumb (RoT) are mainly based on US culture, it can be difficult to apply them universally to other cultures or in the distant future. Although the RoTs in our dataset are in English, social norms vary widely even within English speaking cultures <ref type="bibr">(Haidt et al., 1993)</ref>. Also, social consensus on commonsense rules change over time <ref type="bibr">(Bloom, 2010)</ref>. As a result, if they are to be applied as is to models deployed in other 9 https://crisistextline.org/ cultures or times, the outputs can be socially unacceptable in some cases.</p><p>We also like to note that our RoT set does not represent all general social rules in US, rather it should be considered as a subset of those. Note, our annotators are all from a single online platform, i.e., Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Although we thoroughly verify our dialogues several times with multiple workers (see ?3.2 for details), they may all share group characteristics that can bias the RoT annotation in a specific direction.</p><p>Training a conversational agent solely on our dataset can result in a negativity-prone chatbot. As we pointed out, existing dialogue datasets are biased towards positivity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> for more details); hence dialogue agents tend to agree on wide range of situations <ref type="bibr">(Baheti et al., 2021)</ref>. We deliberately design our dataset to include much more negativity to counterbalance the excessive positivity and teach agents to give constructive feedback. Therefore, we encourage using our dataset along with other ones rich in positivity to train a balanced conversational agent.</p><p>Dialogue systems and AI regulation. Since technology is increasingly interfacing with humans in their everyday lives, it is important to consider dialogue agents as part of the larger socio-technical ecosystem. Specifically, we believe that dialogue agents should be designed such that the conversation could be handed over to humans if needed (hence our Needs Intervention label). Additionally, we echo calls for improved regulations on the (mis)use of AI and dialogue systems <ref type="bibr">(Crawford, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Reich et al., 2021)</ref>, especially to avoid situations where humans might be manipulated or denied due process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Limitations</head><p>As mentioned above ( ?9), our dataset is collected by English-speaking workers on a single online platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk. Also, almost all of the workers were from US; and most of them were liberal-leaning and white (details in Appendix A.6). As a result, the rules-of-thumb (RoTs) in our dataset do not cover all RoTs in North America or other cultures. Therefore, some RoTs may be debatable for some readers. We also recognize our RoTs from the wisdom of the crowd (e.g., crowdsourcing) and social norms are not equivalent to moral correctness (details in ?2.4). Furthermore, we note that constructive feedback is subjective and can vary widely among people. Hence, some responses may be questionable or accusatory due to the toxic and unethical contexts. However, we ground our annotation guidelines in various social science research (details in ?2.2) and went through multiple verification steps (details in ?3.2 and Appendix A.3) to minimize this issue. We hope future work will explore the impact of guiding conversations with RoTs that do not match the interlocutor's norms and values.</p><p>Although Canary and Prost show promising results on having prosocial conversations, our work has not fully solved the issue of conversational agents generating inappropriate responses to problematic user input. We have observed Canary can sometimes generate RoTs that are unrelated or irrelevant for certain contexts. It may also predict casual contexts as needing caution or human intervention. Despite Prost being trained on many large-scale publicly available multi-turn dialogue datasets, it still generates incoherent or inappropriate responses to given dialogue contexts. Also, since Prost is based on the pre-trained PushShift Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Roller et al., 2021)</ref>, which is pretrained on the Reddit corpus, generating socially biased or toxic responses is still possible. We encourage future research towards addressing these issues, and hope our work opens up discussions in the dialogue research field for making conversational agents to be more prosocial.</p></div>

The situations of Social Chemistry are scraped from Reddit, <ref type="bibr">ROCStories (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016)</ref>, and Dear Abby advice archives. 10 They offer relevant rulesof-thumb (RoTs) for those situations. In addition, normative attributes (e.g., ethical judgments, expected cultural pressure, moral foundations) are annotated on each RoT. First, we choose situations with RoTs targeting the writer of the situation (e.g., situation: "hoping to spam others", RoT: "It's bad to intentionally disrupt others."). This indicates a first-person situation that is more fit for starting utterances than a third-person narrative (e.g., "Eventually Jack could afford his own plane"). Next, we select situations with RoTs having pressure against or strong pressure for the action in the situation (i.e., action-pressure &lt; 0 or action-pressure = 2). We find those situations more problematic than others. The filtering results in 36k situations.</p><p>ETHICS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Hendrycks et al., 2021)</ref> is a benchmark for assessing language models' basic knowledge of ethical judgments in English.

The scenarios only include actions that are clearly right or wrong rather than moral dilemmas. We extract sentences that are labeled 1 from the commonsense morality subset, resulting in 9.7k scenarios.</p><p>Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sap et al., 2020)</ref> is an English corpus of statements annotated with structured toxicity labels and free-text explanations of implied social biases.

I mean do you expect a man to do cooking cleaning and washing?").</p><p>We select posts that have implied statement and targeted group attributes. We find they tend to be more grammatical and have less noise than ones without the implications; hence more suitable to be used as dialogue utterances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Drafting Dialogue Openers</head><p>Situations from Social Chemistry and ETHICS are short descriptions of behavior/situation instead of complete sentences (e.g., "not getting treatment for my sick child"). Thus, we prompt GPT-3 with examples to convert them to first-person narrative (e.g., "I'm not going to get treatment for my sick child"). For SBIC, we use the original text as is since they are biased remarks made by people from online social media.</p><p>The second utterance is an elaboration question that rephrases the first utterance for reflective listening. Asking questions to conversation openers is frequent and encouraged in human conversations <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Rashkin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Welivita and Pu, 2020)</ref>. When asking, rephrased questions (e.g., "Why didn't you tell someone about this?"; Utterance 2, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) are better than short ones (e.g., "Why?") as they show more respectful attention to the speaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Rogers, 1946)</ref>. We give rephrased questions as examples when prompting GPT-3 to prevent generating such short inquiries.</p><p>The third utterance is generated by GPT-3 prompted to play a problematic role, in response to the elaboration question. As we ground the response on the problematic first utterance, GPT-3 successfully continues on with the misconduct. Large pre-trained language models are known to be easily follow toxic, unethical inputs during inference <ref type="bibr">(Gehman et al., 2020)</ref>. Here, we aim to make the best of their shortcoming.</p><p>The following is an example of the prompt including a few-shot sample that we used: A is a toxically biased chatbot answering the reason behind its thoughts.

We ask workers to guide the interlocutor to be more prosocial (i.e., conform to more socially accepted behaviors) aligned with the RoTs. We give careful instructions and examples to help workers write better responses: (1) ground the responses on your RoTs;</p><p>(2) kindly suggest or wisely advise the speaker to do socially accepted behaviors; (3) let the speaker know about the better alternate results when doing socially accepted behaviors; (4) the art of persuasion is in making the other also want what you want, not making them do what you want; and <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> show empathy whenever possible. The following is an example we gave: "Don't you also want to have a happy relationship with your family?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuing the Conversation by Taking Turns between Workers and GPT-3</head><p>After collecting the feedback, we feed the dialogue to GPT-3 again and gather its responses. We then go through another round of collecting prosocial feedback on the dialogue. In cases where the other speaker accepts the feedback and agrees to behave well, we ask workers to write positive, thankful, and encouraging responses instead. We run two rounds of annotation to collect at most six turns of dialogue.</p><p>Dialogue Proofreading Although we only let qualified workers write utterances, constructive feedback is subjective and can vary widely among workers. Also, since the dialogues contain socially unacceptable behavior, we find some worker responses overly harsh or accusatory. Thus, verifying its sound tone is crucial for ensuring the objectivity of the feedback. Moreover, although GPT-3's responses are fluent, they still lack consistency and coherency <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>. We find this proofreading effective for collecting coherent human-machine conversations with well-written constructive feedback. On average, our workers modified 1.1 and 1.7 utterances per dialogue for the first and second round, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the annotation page for workers proofreading the previous response annotation round.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4 Collecting Dialogue Safety Labels</head><p>To ensure objectivity for annotating dialogue safety, we provide detailed descriptions for label decision. Some works rely on short descriptions (e.g., "ok to send in a friendly conversation with someone you just met online") to capture various unacceptable contents in a friendly conversation <ref type="bibr">(Dinan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xu et al., 2020)</ref>. Instead of short descriptions, we offer workers an exhaustive list of examples along with the definition for each safety class referring to recent AI-ethics discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Weidinger et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Thoppilan et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Needs Intervention. "Requiring immediate action to remedy harm or avert danger to life, health or property (e.g.,, emergency)." We follow this definition in reference to <ref type="bibr">Wex,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> an open-encyclopedia for law <ref type="bibr">(wex, 2022)</ref>. We describe this case as situations where contacting another human is highly required, rather than getting responses from a chatbot. These include, but are not limited to the following circumstances: illegal activities (especially those that harm others); medical or health issues; selfharm/suicide; danger of/imminent harm to oneself or someone else; threats of violence to others (murder, rape, etc.); terrorism; and situations needing to call 911.</p><p>Needs Caution. "Rude / Unethical / Biased / Dangerous / Offensive / Harmful / Hurtful / Lewd / (Potentially) leading to unnecessary conflicts (but not an emergency)." This includes, but is not limited to: violating ethics, social norms, commonsense; displaying or showing intent of aggressive, angry, hostile, or somewhat dangerous behavior; sexual advances or lewd comments (especially without consent); and unjust discrimination or marginalization of sensitive characteristics or specific group of people (e.g., age, caste, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, race, and victims of a major violent event). We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Weidinger et al. (2021)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Thoppilan et al. (2022)</ref> for the list of examples.</p><p>Casual. "Nothing socially unacceptable / Ca-sual conversation / Polite disagreements / Admitting one's errors." This label refers to dialogues which are thought to be casual in everyday life while not related to the NEEDS INTERVENTION or NEEDS CAUTION categories. Behaviors that will not accompany social criticism fall into this category, such as the following: casual, friendly, polite conversations; civil or polite disagreements or discussions; the dangerous situation has been completely cleared and there is no possibility of further harm; cases where speaker accepts/agrees with the critique; and when speaker admits its missteps and promises to change their mind or behavior. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows the full description of the dialogue safety labels given to the workers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref> displays the annotation page for workers on MTurk annotating dialogue safety to conversation utterances.</p><p>Criterion for the final safety labels. As we collected three annotations with three safety categories, nine combinations of annotations exist for each context. To leave the diverse votings intact as much as possible, we decide the final label of the dialogue context according to the vote combination of the annotations. Specifically, since situations requiring intervention may lead to critical outcomes, they cannot be missed. Thus, we decide a dialogue context as NEEDS INTERVENTION, even for a single vote to 'Needs Intervention'. CASUAL is the case where all three workers unanimously vote for 'Casual'. POSSIBLY NEEDS CAUTION, PROBA-BLY NEEDS CAUTION, NEEDS CAUTION refers to one, two, three votes for 'Needs Caution' without any votes for 'Needs Intervention', respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.6 Worker Statistics</head><p>Demographics A total of 212 workers participated in the data annotation process. As social norms differ across cultures, we limit our annotators to residents in Canada and the US. We collected demographic information from our workers after the dataset annotation through an optional survey, in which 85% of them participated. We find 50% of workers identify as a man, 49% of workers as a woman, and 1% as non-binary. In terms of age, 41% of workers are in their 30s, 27% in their 40s, 14% in their 50s, 10% in their 20s, 6% in their 60s, and 1% in their 70s. 73% of the workers identify as White, 9% as multiracial, 7% as Asian, 6% as Black, 4% as Hispanic, and &lt;1% as Native American. Almost all workers have lived in US for more than 10 years (97%); 57% of them live in suburban areas, 25% in urban areas, and 18% in rural areas. Regarding education, 48% of the workers have a bachelor's degree, 19% have some college experience, 12% have an associate degree, 12% have a graduate degree, and 9% are high school graduates. 43% of the workers consider themselves as middle class, 39% as working class, 10% as lower class, and 8% as upper-middle class. For political stance, 62% of the workers identify as liberal-leaning, 20% conservative-leaning, and 18% moderate. In terms of religion, the majority of our workers have no religion (62%), 29% are Christian, and 9% have another religion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conflict Management Styles of Workers</head><p>We additionally ask workers to report their conflict management style, since that may influence their annotations. Inspired by conflict handling social science research <ref type="bibr">(DeChurch and Marks, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Rahim, 2002)</ref>, we ask workers to report how assertive and conflict averse they consider themselves, on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" to "very much". The mean scores are 2.79 and 3.63 for assertiveness and conflict aversiveness, respectively; with standard deviation 1.02 and 1.03. </p></div>
