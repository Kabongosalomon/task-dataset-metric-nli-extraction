<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of natural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot learners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-bystep answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding "Let's think step by step" before each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted fewshot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with 175B parameter InstructGPT model, as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or few-shot exemplars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Scaling up the size of language models has been key ingredients of recent revolutions in natural language processing (NLP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Vaswani et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Devlin et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Raffel et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Brown et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Thoppilan et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Rae et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">, Chowdhery et al., 2022</ref>. The success of large language models (LLMs) is often attributed to (in-context) few-shot or zero-shot learning. It can solve various tasks by simply conditioning the models on a few examples (few-shot) or instructions describing the task (zero-shot). The method of conditioning the language model is called "prompting" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Liu et al., 2021b]</ref>, and designing prompts either manually <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Schick and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sch?tze, 2021, Reynolds and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McDonell, 2021]</ref> or automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Shin et al., 2020</ref> has become a hot topic in NLP.</p><p>InstructGPT model. We also evaluate Zero-shot-CoT with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM, showing similar magnitudes of improvements on MultiArith and GSM8K. Importantly, with our single fixed prompt, zero-shot LLMs have a significantly better scaling curve comparable to that of the few-shot CoT baseline. We also show that besides Few-shot-CoT requiring human engineering of multi-step reasoning prompts, their performance deteriorates if prompt example question types and task question type are unmatched, suggesting high sensitivity to per-task prompt designs. In contrast, the versatility of this single prompt across diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied zero-shot fundamental capabilities of LLMs, such as higher-level broad cognitive capabilities like generic logical reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Chollet, 2019]</ref>. While the vibrant field of LLMs started out from the premise of excellent few-shot learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020]</ref>, we hope our work encourages more research into uncovering high-level and multi-task zero-shot capabilities hidden inside those models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>We briefly review the two core preliminary concepts that form the basis of this work: the advent of large language models (LLMs) and prompting, and chain of thought (CoT) prompting for multi-step reasoning.</p><p>Large language models and prompting A language model (LM), is a model that looks to estimate the probability distribution over text. Recently, scaling improvements through larger model sizes (from a few million <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Merity et al., 2016]</ref> to hundreds of millions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Devlin et al., 2019]</ref> to hundreds of billions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020]</ref> parameters) and larger data (e.g. webtext corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Gao et al., 2020]</ref>) have enabled pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to be incredibly adept at many downstream NLP tasks. Besides the classic "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Liu et al., 2021b]</ref>, models scaled to 100B+ parameters exhibit properties conducive to few-shot learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020]</ref>, by way of in context learning, where one can use a text or template known as a prompt to strongly guide the generation to output answers for desired tasks, thus beginning an era of "pre-train and prompt" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Liu et al., 2021a]</ref>. In work, we call such prompts with explicit conditioning on few task examples as few-shot prompts, and other template-only prompts as zero-shot prompts.</p><p>Chain of thought prompting Multi-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Rae et al., 2021]</ref>. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting , an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution by modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant boosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large language models like PaLM <ref type="bibr">[Chowdhery et al., 2022]</ref>. The top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows standard few-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a given for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported in the original work . To differentiate it from our method, we call  as Few-shot-CoT in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Zero-shot Chain of Thought</head><p>We propose Zero-shot-CoT, a zero-shot template-based prompting for chain of thought reasoning. It differs from the original chain of thought prompting  as it does not require step-by-step few-shot examples, and it differs from most of the prior template prompting <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Liu et al., 2021b]</ref> as it is inherently task-agnostic and elicits multi-hop reasoning across a wide range of tasks with a single template. The core idea of our method is simple, as described in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: add Let's think step by step, or a a similar text (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>), to extract step-by-step reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Two-stage prompting</head><p>While Zero-shot-CoT is conceptually simple, it uses prompting twice to extract both reasoning and answer, as explained in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In contrast, the zero-shot baseline (see the bottom-left in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) already uses prompting in the form of "The answer is", to extract the answers in correct formats. Few-shot prompting, standard or CoT, avoids needing such answer-extraction prompting by explicitly designing the few-shot example answers to end in such formats (see the top-right and top-left Q: On average Joe throws 25 punches per minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes. How many punches did he throw? A: Let's think step by step.</p><p>In one minute, Joe throws 25 punches. In three minutes, Joe throws 3 * 25 = 75 punches. In five rounds, Joe throws 5 * 75 = 375 punches. Q: On average Joe throws 25 punches per minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 ??? A: Let's think step by step.</p><p>In one minute, Joe throws 25 punches. ???In five rounds, Joe throws 5 * 75 = 375 punches. . Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 375.</p><p>LLM LLM ?1st prompt? Reasoning Extraction ?2nd prompt? Answer Extraction <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Full pipeline of Zero-shot-CoT as described in ? 3: we first use the first "reasoning" prompt to extract a full reasoning path from a language model, and then use the second "answer" prompt to extract the answer in the correct format from the reasoning text.</p><p>in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In summary, Few-shot-CoT  requires careful human engineering of a few prompt examples with specific answer formats per task, while Zero-shot-CoT requires less engineering but requires prompting LLMs twice.</p><p>1st prompt: reasoning extraction In this step we first modify the input question x into a prompt x using a simple template "Q: <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref>. A: [T]", where [X] is an input slot for x and [T] is an slot for hand-crafted trigger sentence t that would extract chain of though to answer the question x. For example, if we use "Let's think step by step" as a trigger sentence, the prompt x would be "Q: <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref>. A: Let's think step by step.". See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> for more trigger examples. Prompted text x is then fed into a language model and generate subsequent sentence z. We can use any decoding strategy, but we used greedy decoding throughout the paper for the simplicity.</p><p>2nd prompt: answer extraction In the second step, we use generated sentence z along with prompted sentence x to extract the final answer from the language model. To be concrete, we simply concatenate three elements as with "[X ] [Z] [A]": <ref type="bibr">[X ]</ref> for 1st prompt x , [Z] for sentence z generated at the first step, and [A] for a trigger sentence to extract answer. The prompt for this step is self-augmented, since the prompt contains the sentence z generated by the same language model. In experiment, we use slightly different answer trigger depending on the answer format. For example, we use "Therefore, among A through E, the answer is" for multi-choice QA, and "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is" for math problem requiring numerical answer. See Appendix A.5 for the lists of answer trigger sentences. Finally, the language model is fed the prompted text as input to generate sentences? and parse the final answer. See "Answer Cleansing" at ?4 for the parser details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiment</head><p>Tasks and datasets We evaluate our proposal on 12 datasets from four categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic, and other logical reasoning tasks. See Appendix A.2 for the detailed description of each datasets.</p><p>For arithmetic reasoning, we consider the following six datasets: (1) SingleEq <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2015]</ref>, (2) AddSub <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Hosseini et al., 2014]</ref>, (3) MultiArith <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Roy and Roth, 2015]</ref>, (4) AQUA-RAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Ling et al., 2017]</ref>, (5) GSM8K <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Cobbe et al., 2021]</ref>, and (6) SVAMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Patel et al., 2021]</ref>. The first three are from the classic Math World Problem Repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016]</ref>, and the last three are from more recent benchmarks. SingleEq and AddSub contain easier problems, which do not require multi-step calculation to solve the tasks. MultiArith, AQUA-RAT, GSM8k, and SVAMP are more challenging datasets that require multi-step reasoning to solve.</p><p>For commonsense reasoning, we use CommonsenseQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[Talmor et al., 2019]</ref> and StrategyQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Geva et al., 2021]</ref>. CommonsenseQA asks questions with complex semantics that often require reasoning based on prior knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[Talmor et al., 2019]</ref>. StrategyQA requires models to infer an implicit multi-hop reasoning to answer questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Geva et al., 2021]</ref>.</p><p>For symbolic reasoning, we use Last Letter Concatenation and Coin Flip . Last letter Concatenation asks the model to concatenate the last letters of each word. We used randomly selected four names for each sample. Coin Flip asks the model to answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either flip or do not flip the coin. We created samples of four times flip or not flip trials. Although these tasks are easy for humans, LMs typically exhibit a flat scaling curve.</p><p>For other logical reasoning tasks, we choose two evaluation sets from the BIG-bench effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Srivastava et al., 2022]</ref>: Date Understanding 2 and Tracking Shuffled Objects. Date Understanding asks models to infer the date from a context. Tracking Shuffled Objects tests a model's ability to infer the final state of objects given its initial state and a sequence of object shuffling. We used a dataset of tracking three shuffled objects for our experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models</head><p>We experiment with 17 models in total. Main experiments are conducted with Instruct-GPT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ouyang et al., 2022]</ref> (text-ada/babbage/curie/davinci-001 and text-davinci-002) 3 , original GPT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020]</ref> (ada, babbage, curie, and davinci) 4 , and PaLM <ref type="bibr">[Chowdhery et al., 2022]</ref> (8B, 62B, and 540B). In addition, we used GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Radford et al., 2019]</ref>, GPT-Neo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Black et al., 2021]</ref>, GPT-J <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021]</ref>, T0 <ref type="bibr">[Sanh et al., 2022]</ref>, and OPT  for model scaling study. The size of LMs ranges from 0.3B to 540B. We include both standard (e.g. GPT-3 and OPT), and instruction following variants (e.g. Instruct-GPT3 and T0). See Appendix A.3 for model description details. Unless otherwise stated, we use text-davinci-002 throughout the experiments.</p><p>Baselines We compare our Zero-shot-CoT mainly to standard Zero-shot prompting to verify the effectiveness of its chain of thought reasoning. For Zero-shot experiments, similar answer prompts as Zero-shot-CoT are used as default. See Appendix A.5 for detail. To better evaluate the zero-shot ability of LLMs on reasoning tasks, we also compare our method to Few-shot and Few-shot-CoT baselines from , using the same in-context examples. Throughout the experiments, we use greedy decoding across all the methods. For the zero-shot approaches, the results are therefore deterministic. For the few-shot approaches, since the order of in-context examples could affect the results , we run each experiment only once with a fixed seed across all methods and datasets, for fair comparisons with the zero-shot methods.  showed that the order of examples did not cause large variance in CoT experiments.</p><p>Answer cleansing After the model outputs a text by answer extraction (see ? 3 and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), our method picks up only the part of the answer text that first satisfies the answer format. For example, if the answer prompting outputs "probably 375 and 376" on arithmetic tasks, we extract the first number "375" and set it as the model prediction. In the case of multiple-choice, the first large letter we encounter is set as the prediction. See Appendix A.6 for more detail. Standard Zero-shot method follows the same idea. For Few-shot and Few-shot-CoT methods, we follow  and first extract the answer text after "The answer is " from the model output, and apply the same answer cleansing to parse the answer text. If "The answer is" is not found in the model output, we search from the back of the text and set the first text that satisfies the answer format as the prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Results</head><p>Zero-shot-CoT vs. Zero-shot <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarize accuracy of our method (Zero-shot-CoT) and standard zero-shot prompting (Zero-shot) for each dataset. Zero-shot-CoT substantially outperforms four out of six arithmetic reasoning tasks (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA, SVAMP), all symbolic 2 While prior work  categorized Date Understanding task into Common Sense reasoning, our study categorized this task into logical reasoning because this task requires less prior knowledge and more logical reasoning between dates.</p><p>3 Our experiment for Instruct GPT-3 models includes both text-****-001 and text-davinci-002. Text-davinci-002 differs from text-****-001 in that they use different fine-tuning data depending on the date range collected from the APIs. Specifically, text-davinci-002 uses data up to Jun 2021, while text-****-001 uses data up to Oct 2019. (See https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Our experiments with GPT3 series are conducted by using OpenAI API between <ref type="bibr">April-2022 and</ref><ref type="bibr">May-2022, except for No.10-16 in</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> in Aug-2022 . We attach model size information to each model referring to the following URL. https://blog.eleuther.ai/gpt3-model-sizes/    -17.9 PaLM 540B: Few-Shot-CoT  -56.9 PaLM 540B: Few-Shot-CoT + self consistency <ref type="bibr">[Wang et al., 2022] -74.4</ref> reasoning, and all other logical reasoning tasks (from BIG-bench <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Srivastava et al., 2022]</ref>). For example, Zero-shot-CoT achieves score gains from 17.7% to 78.7% on MultiArith and from 10.4% to 40.7% on GSM8K. Our method gives on-par performances for the remaining two arithmetic reasoning tasks (SingleEq and AddSub), which is expected since they do not require multi-step reasoning.</p><p>In commonsense reasoning tasks, Zero-shot-CoT does not provide performance gains. It is expected as  also reports that even Few-shot-CoT does not provide performance gains on Lambda (135B), but does improve StrategyQA when combined with substantially larger PaLM (540B) model, which may also apply for ours. More importantly, we observe that many generated chain of thought themselves are surprisingly logically correct or only contains human-understandable mistakes (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>), suggesting that Zero-shot-CoT does elicit for better commonsense reasoning even when the task metrics do not directly reflect it. We provide samples generated by Zero-shot-CoT for each dataset in Appendix B.  Comparison with other baselines <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> compares the performances on two arithmetic reasoning benchmarks (MultiArith and GSM8K) across Zero-shot-CoT and baselines. The large gap between standard prompting (1st block) and chain of thought prompting (2nd block) suggests that these tasks are difficult without eliciting multi-step reasoning. Major improvements are confirmed on both Instruct GPT-3 (175B) and PaLM (540B) models (4th block). While Zero-shot-CoT naturally underperforms Few-shot-CoT, it substantially outperforms standard Few-shot prompting with even 8 examples per task. For GSM8K, Zero-shot-CoT with Instruct GPT-3 (175B) also outperforms finetuned GPT-3 and standard few-shot prompting with large models (PaLM, 540B), reported in  (3rd and 4th block). Further experiment results with PaLM are found at Appendix D Does model size matter for zero-shot reasoning? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref> compares performance of various language models on MultiArith / GSM8K. Without chain of thought reasoning, the performance does not increase or increases slowly as the model scale is increased, i.e., the curve is mostly flat. In contrast, the performance drastically increases with chain of thought reasoning, as the model size gets bigger, for Original/Instruct GPT-3 and PaLM. When the model size is smaller, chain of thought reasoning is not effective. This result aligns with the few-shot experiment results in . Appendix E shows extensive experiment results using wider variety of language models, including GPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, T0, and OPT. We also manually investigated the quality of generated chain of thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the sampled outputs for each model).</p><p>Error Analysis To better understand the behavior of Zero-shot-CoT, we manually investigated randomly selected examples generated by Instruct-GPT3 with Zero-shot-CoT prompting. See Appendix C for examples, where some of the observations include: (1) In commonsense reasoning (CommonsenseQA), Zero-shot-CoT often produces flexible and reasonable chain of thought even when the final prediction is not correct. Zero-shot-CoT often output multiple answer choices when the model find it is difficult to narrow it down to one (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> for examples).</p><p>(2) In arithmetic reasoning (MultiArith), Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT show substantial differences regarding Let's think 57.5 8</p><p>Before we dive into the answer, 55.7 9</p><p>The answer is after the proof. 45.7 10 misleading Don't think.

First, Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting the correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zero-shot-CoT also sometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT tend to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) * 4.</p><p>How does prompt selection affect Zero-shot-CoT? We validate the robustness of Zero-shot-CoT against input prompts. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> summarizes performance using 16 different templates with three categories. Specifically, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Webson and Pavlick [2022]</ref>, the categories include instructive (encourage reasoning), misleading (discourage reasoning or encouraging reasoning but in a wrong way), and irrelevant (nothing to do with reasoning). The results indicate that the performance is improved if the text is written in a way that encourages chain of thought reasoning, i.e., the templates are within "instructive" category. However, the difference in accuracy is significant depending on the sentence. In this experiment, "Let's think step by step." achieves the best results. Interestingly, it is found that different templates encourage the model to express reasoning quite differently (see Appendix B for sample outputs by each template). In contrast, when we use misleading or irrelevant templates, the performance does not improve.</p><p>It remains an open question how to automatically create better templates for Zero-shot-CoT.</p><p>How does prompt selection affect Few-shot-CoT? <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the performance of Fewshot-CoT when using examples from different datasets: CommonsenseQA to AQUA-RAT and CommonsenseQA to MultiArith. The domains are different in both cases, but the answer format is the same in the former. Surprisingly, the chain of thought examples from different domains (common sense to arithmetic) but with the same answer (multiple-choice) format provide substantial performance gain over Zero-shot (to AQUA-RAT), measured relative to the possible improvements from Zero-shot-CoT or Few-shot-CoT. In contrast, the performance gain becomes much less when using examples with different answer types (to MultiArith), confirming prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Min et al., 2022]</ref> that suggests LLMs mostly leverage the few-shot examples to infer the repeated format rather than the task itself in-context. Nevertheless, for both cases the results are worse than Zero-shot-CoT, affirming the importance of task-specific sample engineering in Few-shot-CoT. Reasoning Ability of LLMs Several studies have shown that pre-trained models usually are not good at reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Smith et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Rae et al., 2021</ref>, but its ability can be substantially increased by making them produce step-by-step reasoning, either by fine-tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Rajani et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Cobbe et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Zelikman et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Nye et al., 2022</ref> or few-shot prompting <ref type="bibr">, Chowdhery et al., 2022</ref> (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> for summary of related work). Unlike most prior work, we focus on zero-shot prompting and show that a single fixed trigger prompt substantially increases the zero-shot reasoning ability of LLMs across a variety of tasks requiring complex multi-hop thinking <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, especially when the model is scaled up <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 3</ref>). It also generates reasonable and understandable chain of thought across diverse tasks (Appendix B), even when the final prediction is wrong (Appendix C). Similar to our work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reynolds and McDonell [2021]</ref> demonstrate a prompt, "Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps", would facilitate the multi-step reasoning in a simple arithmetic problem. However, they treated it as a task-specific example and did not evaluate quantitatively on diverse reasoning tasks against baselines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shwartz et al. [2020]</ref> propose to decompose a commonsense question into a series of information seeking question, such as "what is the definition of [X]". It does not require demonstrations but requires substantial manual prompt engineering per each reasoning task. Our results strongly suggest that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners, while prior work  often emphasize only few-shot learning and task-specific in-context learning, e.g. no zero-shot baselines were reported. Our method does not require time-consuming fine-tuning or expensive sample engineering, and can be combined with any pre-trained LLM, serving as the strongest zero-shot baseline for all reasoning tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and Related Work</head><p>Zero-shot Abilities of LLMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Radford et al. [2019]</ref> show that LLMs have excellent zero-shot abilities in many system-1 tasks, including reading comprehension, translation, and summarization. <ref type="bibr">Sanh et al. [2022]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ouyang et al. [2022]</ref> show that such zero-shot abilities of LLMs can be increased by explicitly fine-tuning models to follow instructions. Although these work focus on the zero-shot performances of LLMs, we focus on many system-2 tasks beyond system-1 tasks, considered a grand challenge for LLMs given flat scaling curves. In addition, Zero-shot-CoT is orthogonal to instruction tuning; it increases zero-shot performance for Instruct GPT3, vanilla GPT3, and PaLM (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>From Narrow (task-specific) to Broad (multi-task) Prompting Most prompts are task-specific. While few-shot prompts are naturally so due to task-specific in-context samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Brown et al., 2020</ref>, majority of zero-shot prompts have also focused on per-task engineering (of templates) <ref type="bibr">[Liu et al., 2021b, Reynolds and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McDonell, 2021]</ref>. Borrowing terminologies from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chollet [2019]</ref> which builds on hierarchical models of intelligence <ref type="bibr">[McGrew, 2005, Johnson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bouchard Jr, 2005]</ref>, these prompts are arguably eliciting "narrow generalization" or task-specific skills from LLMs. On the other hand, our method is a multi-task prompt and elicits "broad generalization" or broad cognitive abilities in LLMs, such as logical reasoning or system-2 itself. We hope our work can serve as a reference for accelerating not just logical reasoning research with LLMs, but also discovery of other broad cognitive capabilities within LLMs.</p><p>Training Dataset Details A limitation of the work is the lack of public information on the details of training datasets used for LLMs, e.g. 001 vs 002 for GPT models, original GPT3 vs Instruct-GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ouyang et al., 2022]</ref>, and data for PaLM models <ref type="bibr">[Chowdhery et al., 2022]</ref>. However, big performance increases from Zero-shot to Zero-shot-CoT in all recent large models (InstructGPT 001 or 002, Original GPT3, and PaLM) and consistent improvements in both arithmetic and nonarithmetic tasks suggest that the models are unlikely simply memorizing, but instead capturing a task-agnostic multi-step reasoning capability for generic problem solving. While most results are based on InstructGPT since it is the best performing open-access LLM, key results are reproduced on PaLM, and dataset details in InstructGPT (Appendix A, B, and F in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ouyang et al. [2022]</ref>) also confirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.</p><p>Limitation and Social Impact Our work is based on prompting methods for large language models. LLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see "Training Dataset Details"), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a method that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various tasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way to probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context learning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large language models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach in previous work that requires hand-crafting few-shot examples per task. Our simple method not only is the minimalist and strongest zero-shot baseline for difficult multi-step system-2 reasoning tasks that long evaded the scaling laws of LLMs, but also encourages the community to further discover similar multi-task prompts that elicit broad cognitive abilities instead of narrow task-specific skills.</p><p>Checklist  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref> summarizes the description of each dataset used in our experiment.

We know that each box has 4 pieces inside it. So, we can multiply 2 by 4 to find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Adam bought. This will give us 8. We can also multiply 5 by 4 to find out how many pieces of caramel candy Adam bought. This will give us 20. Now, we can add 8 and 20 together to find out how much candy Adam bought in total. 8 + 20 = 28 Adam bought 28 pieces of candy in Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 28. Continued on next page A: Let's think step by step. There are 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type, then he has 32 cards in total. If he buys 14 grass type, then he has 46 cards in total, and the number of water type cards becomes 32. The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is $\frac{32}{46} \times 100\% = \fbox{70}\%$. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 70. The first thing we need to do is calculate the volume of the tank. The volume of the tank is 8m x 6m x 2.5m. 8m x 6m x 2.5m = 120m^3 Now that we have the volume of the tank, we need to convert it to litres. 1m^3 = 1000 litres 120m^3 = 120,000 litres The capacity of the tank is 120,000 litres. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.</p><p>Q: In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end.

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29</p><p>A: Let's think step by step.</p><p>There are 12 children to the left of Neha, so there must be at least 12 children in the row. There are 6 children to the right of Radha, so there must be at least 18 children in the row. There are 6 children between Radha and Neha, so there must be at least 24 children in the row. The answer must be between 24 and 27, and the only answer that satisfies this is 26.</p><p>Therefore, the answer is 26. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C. (GT : D) Continued on next page A: Let's think step by step. There are 7 baskets. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. So, there are 2 green peaches in each basket. Now, we need to multiply because there are 7 baskets. 2 multiplied by 7 is 14. So, there are 14 green peaches in the baskets altogether.</p><p>Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.</p><p>Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 14 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?</p><p>A: Let's think step by step. Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour. The recipe calls for a total of 12 cups of flour. That means Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour. The recipe calls for a total of 7 cups of salt. That means Mary needs to add 5 more cups of salt. So, Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour than she does salt. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10. (GT : 3) First, we need to understand what the word "binoculars" means. Binoculars are two telescopes that are joined together and allow a person to see things that are far away. Now, we need to think about where a person might use binoculars. A person might use binoculars to see things that are far away and in the sky, or to see things that are far away and on the ground.</p><p>So, the answer could be either (A) sky or (D) countryside.

The JPEG format is a lossy compression format, which means that some of the image data will be lost when the image is compressed. The Vitruvian Man is a very detailed image, with lots of small details. So, when we compress the image using JPEG, some of those small details will be lost, and the image will not be as sharp and clear as the original. So, in conclusion, JPEG is not the best format for saving an image of the Vitruvian Man. Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is No. Continued on next page A: Let's think step by step. The deadline is Jun 1, 2021, which is 2 days away from now. In 24 hours, it will be Jun 2, 2021. Therefore, among A through F, the answer is A. A: Let's think step by step. First, Bob and Alice swap balls. This means that Alice now has the purple ball and Bob has the green ball. Then, Claire and Bob swap balls. This means that Claire now has the green ball and Bob has the blue ball. Finally, Bob and Alice swap balls. This means that Alice now has the blue ball and Bob has the purple ball. At the end of the game, Bob has the purple ball. Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. A: Let's think step by step. The last letter of "Vinny" is "y". The last letter of "Landon" is "n". The last letter of "Miguel" is "l". The last letter of "Caitlyn" is "n". So, the final answer would be "ynln". Therefore, the answer is "ynln".</p></div>

The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?</p><p>A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so there are 48 inches in 4 feet. Now, we need to know how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches. We can divide 48 by 6. 48 divided by 6 is 8. Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.</p><p>A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 8. A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the donuts. 3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen. So, 3 dozen donuts cost 3 times $68. 3 times $68 is $204. So, the cost of the donuts is $204. Next, we need to find the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen. So, 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost 2 times $80. 2 times $80 is $160. So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is $160. Finally, we need to find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen. So, 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost 6 times $55. 6 times $55 is $330. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330. Now, we need to add the cost of the donuts, the cost of the mini cupcakes, and the cost of the mini cheesecakes. $204 plus $160 plus $330 is $694. So, the total cost is $694. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 694.</p><p>A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 1000.</p><p>(GT : 694) Continued on next page A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that she walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 4 miles per hour. Then, she walked 2 miles in 1 hour, so her speed was 2 miles per hour. So, her average speed was (4 + 2)/2 = 3 miles per hour. Now, we know that she has to walk 12 miles in total, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, she has 6 miles left to walk. We also know that she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. So, we can calculate the time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles: 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours. So, she has 1.5 hours to walk 6 miles. We can calculate her speed by dividing the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour. So, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?</p><p>A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of the house after the repairs. The value of the house increased by 150%, so we need to multiply the original value by 1.5. 80,000 x 1.5 = 120,000. The value of the house after the repairs is $120,000. Now, we need to find the profit. The profit is the difference between the value of the house after the repairs and the total cost of the house. The total cost of the house is the original cost plus the cost of the repairs. 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000. The profit is 120,000 -130,000 = -10,000. Josh lost $10,000. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10,000. (GT :</p></div>

First, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi has already given her chickens. She gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That means she has already given them 40 cups of feed. Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. We know that she has 20 chickens. Each chicken needs three cups of feed. That means she needs 60 cups of feed for all 20 chickens. But she has already given them 40 cups of feed. That means she needs to give them 20 more cups of feed. The following is an example of a problem that requires the use of the distributive property: Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Some picked-up samples from each category are found <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref>.</p><p>First, it is found that the correct samples contain a certain amount of incorrect chain of thought. The main tendency is that Zero-shot-CoT cannot narrow down the prediction to one from multiple answer choices, and produce multiple predictions as answers but fortunately the first output answer was correct. See "Correct -CoT is INCORRECT" rows in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref> Second, as for incorrect samples, commonsense mistake is the most frequent error type. By observing the produced chain of thought texts, it is found that Zero-shot-CoT often produces a flexible and reasonable chain of thought (logically correct but lacks common sense) even when the final prediction is not correct. See "CommonSense Mistake" rows in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref>  A: Let's think step by step. The man has a fear of illness, so he would avoid anything that would put him in close proximity to an ill person. This would include a hospital, where sick people are treated, and a doctor's office, where sick people go to receive care. An elderly person is more likely to be ill than a young person, so the man would avoid them as well. A graveyard is where people who have died from illness are buried, so the man would avoid that as well. The answer is A, sick person. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

If you don't have a piano, you can't use your own. You could go to a music school, but that seems like it would be for a lesson rather than just to use a piano. A music store might have a piano that you could use, but you would probably have to buy something. You could go to a neighbor's house, but that seems like a lot to ask. You could go to a lunch, but that doesn't make sense. You could go to a drawing room, but that also doesn't make sense. The answer must be (B) music store.

Answer Choices: (A) sky (B) vaccation (C) forest (D) countryside (E) roof A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what the word "binoculars" means. Binoculars are two telescopes that are joined together and allow a person to see things that are far away. Now, we need to think about where a person might use binoculars. A person might use binoculars to see things that are far away and in the sky, or to see things that are far away and on the ground. So, the answer could be either (A) sky or (D) countryside. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) or (D). (GT : (C), Zero-shot: (D)) CommonSense Mistake Q: When you get up in the morning before you begin work you should do what? Answer Choices: (A) apply for job (B) sleep (C) concentrate (D) shower (E) just do A: Let's think step by step. The first thing you should do when you wake up is probably to stretch and yawn to get your body moving. Then, you should probably brush your teeth and wash your face to get ready for the day. After that, you might want to eat breakfast to give yourself some energy for the day. Once you're all set, you can start your work for the day. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Answer Choices: (A) reading (B) meditate (C) fall asleep (D) bunk (E) think A: Let's think step by step. If someone is sitting quietly, that means they are not moving around. And if their eyes are moving, they are probably not asleep. So it's probably not (C) or (D). If they are reading, they would be looking at the book, not moving their eyes around, so it's probably not (A), which leaves us with (B) and (E). It's more likely that they are thinking, so (E) is the best answer. Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.</p><p>(GT : (A), Zero-shot: (E)) Continued on next page A: Let's think step by step. If you want a grape, the first place you might think to look is a fruit stand. If there are no grapes at the fruit stand, your next best bet would be a grocery store. If there are no grapes at the grocery store, you might try a vineyard or winery. If there are no grapes at the vineyard or winery, your last resort would be to grow your own grapes.

We compared Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT to contrast the difference of chain of thought produced by these two methods. Specifically, we randomly picked up correct 50 samples and incorrect 50 samples produced by each method and categorized them by types. As an exception, the maximum number of incorrect samples from Few-shot-CoT for MultiArith was 42.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2 MultiArith</head><p>As for correct samples, we examined if the produced chain of thought is logical and consistent with the correct prediction. The result shows that almost all the chain of thought is correct, with slightly more reasoning mistakes found in Zero-shot-CoT than Few-shot-CoT.</p><p>As for incorrect samples, it is found that Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting the correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zeroshot-CoT also sometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT tends to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) * 4. Another finding is that Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT have a certain amount of common sense mistakes to interpret a question. Some examples are found at <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 24</ref>. A (ONE UNNECESSARY STEP ER-ROR): Let's think step by step. Adam bought 13 tickets. That means he spent 13 * 9 = 117 dollars on tickets. After riding the ferris wheel, he had 4 tickets left. That means he used 9 tickets to ride the ferris wheel. That means he spent 9 * 9 = 81 dollars on riding the ferris wheel. So the answer is 117 -81 = 36 dollars.</p><p>Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 36.</p><p>A: Adam started with 13 tickets. He had 4 left after riding the ferris wheel. So he must have spent 13 -4 = 9 tickets. 9 tickets times 9 dollars per ticket is 9 * 9 = 81.

If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?</p><p>A (ONE UNNECESSARY STEP ER-ROR): Let's think step by step. There are 8 kids, so that means there are 7 adults. Each adult meal costs $5, so that means that the 7 adults will cost $5*7=$35 Now we just need to add the two numbers together. $35+8=43$ So it would cost $43 for the group to eat.</p><p>Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 43.</p><p>A: If 8 were kids, then that means there were 15 -8 = 7 adults.

If Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, how much did she spend?</p><p>A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much each type of flower costs. There are 5 roses, and each rose costs 6 dollars. So, the cost of the roses is 5*6=30 dollars. There are 5 daisies, and each daisy costs 6 dollars. So, the cost of the daisies is 5*6=30 dollars. Then, we need to calculate the total cost. The total cost is the cost of the roses plus the cost of the daisies. So, the total cost is 30+30=60 dollars. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 60.</p><p>A (CALCULATOR ERROR): Each flower was 6 dollars. Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies. So she spent 5 * 6 + 5 * 6 = 60 + 30 = 90. The answer is 90. Q: While shopping for music online, Faye bought 2 country albums and 3 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 6 songs. How many songs did Faye buy total?</p><p>A: Let's think step by step. Faye bought 2 country albums. Each album has 6 songs. So she bought 2 * 6 = 12 songs from the country albums. Faye bought 3 pop albums. Each album has 6 songs. So she bought 3 * 6 = 18 songs from the pop albums. In total, Faye bought 12 + 18 = 30 songs. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30.</p><p>A (CALCULATOR ERROR): Faye bought 2 country albums and 3 pop albums. Each album had 6 songs. So she bought 2 * 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 songs. The answer is 24. That means Jerry will need to make 1 trip to the second table. In total, Jerry will make 3 trips. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3. A (OTHERS; MAXIMUM LIMIT OF TEXT LENGTH): Let's think step by step. Each chocolate bar in a box costs $3. If a box had 9 bars total, then Wendy sold all but 3 bars. How much money would she have made? We can solve this problem using algebra. Let's start by creating a variable to represent the number of chocolate bars Wendy sold. We'll call this variable "x". If Wendy sold "x" chocolate bars, then she would have 9 -x chocolate bars left in the box. We know that each chocolate bar costs $3, so the total cost of the chocolate bars Wendy sold Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: Wendy would have made $12.</p></div>

We randomly select human names from names-dataset library (https://pypi.org/project/names-dataset/) and insert them into {Name1} through {Name4}.? 'Take the last letters of each words in "{Name1} {Name2} {Name3} {Name4}" and concatenate them.'As for Coin Flip, we use the following template. We randomly select human names from namesdataset library and insert them into {Name1} through {Name4}. We also randomly pick up "flips" or "does not flip" and insert the phrase into each {flips | does not flip} part, respectively.?

This means that Victor used the same amount of brown sugar as he did white sugar. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0. (GT : 0.375)A: Let's think step by step. Sandy grew 6 car- rots. Sam grew 3 carrots. That means they grew a total of 9 carrots. Therefore, the answerA: Let's think step by step. Melanie bought a Batman game for $ 6.95. So she spent $ 6.95 on video games. Then she bought a strategy game for $ 7.90. So she spent $ 14.85 on video games. Then she bought a Superman game for $ 7.73. So she spent $ 22.58 on video games. Melanie already owns 4 games. So she spent $ 18.58 on video games. Therefore, Melanie spent a total of $ 18.58 on video games. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 18.58 (GT : 22.58)A: Let's think step by step. Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy and 5 boxes of caramel candy.</note></figure>

A: There were originally 12 people in line. 10 of them left, so that left 12 -10 = 2. Then 15 more got in line, so that is 2 + 15 = 17. The answer is 17. Q: Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?</p><p>A (OTHERS; QUESTION UNDER-STANDING ERROR): Let's think step by step. How much money does Luke make in a week? How much money does Luke spend in a week? How much money does Luke have left over at the end of the week? How long will it take Luke to save up $54? Luke makes $27 a week. He spends $3 a week. He has $24 left over at the end of the week. It will take Luke 2 weeks to save up $54. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.</p><p>A: Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. In total, he made 9 + 18 = 27 dollars. If he spends 3 dollars a week, that is 3 dollars * 4 weeks = 12 dollars a month. So the money would last him 27 / 12 = 2.25 months. The answer is 2.25 months.</p><p>(GT : 9 weeks)</p><p>Continued on next page</p></div>			</div>
