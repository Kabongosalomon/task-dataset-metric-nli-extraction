<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Two common NLP feature types are lexical properties of words and unlexicalized linguistic/structural interactions between words. Prior work on relation extraction has extensively studied how to design such features by combining discrete lexical properties (e.g. the identity of a word, its lemma, its morphological features) with aspects of a word's linguistic context (e.g. whether it lies between two entities or on a dependency path between them). While these help learning, they make generalization to unseen words difficult. An alternative approach to capturing lexical information relies on continuous word embeddings 2 as representative of words but generalizable to new words. Embedding features have improved many tasks, including NER, chunking, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Koo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth and Woodsend, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plank and Moschitti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nguyen and Grishman, 2014)</ref>. Embeddings can capture lexical information, but alone they are insufficient: in state-of-the-art systems, they are used alongside features of the broader linguistic context.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a compositional model that combines unlexicalized linguistic context and word embeddings for relation extraction, a task in which contextual feature construction plays a major role in generalizing to unseen data. Our model allows for the composition of embeddings with arbitrary linguistic structure, as expressed by hand crafted features. In the following sections, we begin with a precise construction of compositional embeddings using word embeddings in conjunction with unlexicalized features. Various feature sets used in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nguyen and Grishman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hermann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth and Woodsend, 2014)</ref> are cap-2 Such embeddings have a long history in NLP, including term-document frequency matrices and their lowdimensional counterparts obtained by linear algebra tools (LSA, PCA, CCA, NNMF), Brown clusters, random projections and vector space models. Recently, neural networks / deep learning have provided several popular methods for obtaining such embeddings.  A feature that depends on the embedding for this context word could generalize to other lexical indicators of the same relation (e.g. "operating") that don't appear with ART during training. But lexical information alone is insufficient; relation extraction requires the identification of lexical roles: where a word appears structurally in the sentence. In (2), the word "of" between "suburbs" and "Baghdad" suggests that the first entity is part of the second, yet the earlier occurrence after "direction" is of no significance to the relation. Even finer information can be expressed by a word's role on the dependency path between entities. In (3) we can distinguish the word "died" from other irrelevant words that don't appear between the entities. tured as special cases of this construction. Adding these compositional embeddings directly to a standard log-linear model yields a special case of our full model. We then treat the word embeddings as parameters giving rise to our powerful, efficient, and easy-to-implement log-bilinear model. The model capitalizes on arbitrary types of linguistic annotations by better utilizing features associated with substructures of those annotations, including global information. We choose features to promote different properties and to distinguish different functions of the input words. The full model involves three stages. First, it decomposes the annotated sentence into substructures (i.e. a word and associated annotations). Second, it extracts features for each substructure (word), and combines them with the word's embedding to form a substructure embedding. Third, we sum over substructure embeddings to form a composed annotated sentence embedding, which is used by a final softmax layer to predict the output label (relation).</p><p>The result is a state-of-the-art relation extractor for unseen domains from ACE 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Walker et al., 2006)</ref> and the relation classification dataset from SemEval-2010 Task 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hendrickx et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Contributions This paper makes several contributions, including:</p><p>1. We introduce the FCM, a new compositional embedding model for relation extraction. 2. We obtain the best reported results on ACE-2005 for coarse-grained relation extraction in the cross-domain setting, by combining FCM with a log-linear model. 3. We obtain results on on SemEval-2010 Task 8 competitive with the best reported results. Note that other work has already been published that builds on the FCM, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hashimoto et al. (2015)</ref>, , dos Santos 3 In ACE 2005, ART refers to a relation between a person and an artifact; such as a user, owner, inventor, or manufacturer relationship <ref type="bibr">et al. (2015)</ref>,  and . Additionally, we have extended FCM to incorporate a low-rank embedding of the features , which focuses on fine-grained relation extraction for ACE and ERE. This paper obtains better results than the low-rank extension on ACE coarse-grained relation extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Relation Extraction</head><p>In relation extraction we are given a sentence as input with the goal of identifying, for all pairs of entity mentions, what relation exists between them, if any. For each pair of entity mentions in a sentence S, we construct an instance (y, x), where x = (M 1 , M 2 , S, A). S = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n } is a sentence of length n that expresses a relation of type y between two entity mentions M 1 and M 2 , where M 1 and M 2 are sequences of words in S. A is the associated annotations of sentence S, such as part-of-speech tags, a dependency parse, and named entities. We consider directed relations: for a relation type Rel, y=Rel(M 1 , M 2 ) and y =Rel(M 2 , M 1 ) are different relations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows ACE 2005 relations, and has a strong label bias towards negative examples. We also consider the task of relation classification (Se-mEval), where the number of negative examples is artificially reduced.</p><p>Embedding Models Word embeddings and compositional embedding models have been successfully applied to a range of NLP tasks, however the applications of these embedding models to relation extraction are still limited. Prior work on relation classification (e.g. SemEval 2010 Task 8) has focused on short sentences with at most one relation per sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Socher et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zeng et al., 2014)</ref>. For relation extraction, where negative examples abound, prior work has assumed that only the named entity boundaries and not their types were available <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Plank and Moschitti, 2013;</ref>. Other work has as-sumed that the order of two entities in a relation are given while the relation type itself is unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nguyen and Grishman, 2014;</ref>. The standard relation extraction task, as adopted by ACE 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Walker et al., 2006)</ref>, uses long sentences containing multiple named entities with known types 4 and unknown relation directions. We are the first to apply neural language model embeddings to this task.</p><p>Motivation and Examples Whether a word is indicative of a relation depends on multiple properties, which may relate to its context within the sentence. For example, whether the word is inbetween the entities, on the dependency path between them, or to their left or right may provide additional complementary information. Illustrative examples are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and provide the motivation for our model. In the next section, we will show how we develop informative representations capturing both the semantic information in word embeddings and the contextual information expressing a word's role relative to the entity mentions. We are the first to incorporate all of this information at once. The closest work is that of Nguyen and Grishman (2014), who use a loglinear model for relation extraction with embeddings as features for only the entity heads. Such embedding features are insensitive to the broader contextual information and, as we show, are not sufficient to elicit the word's role in a relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Feature-rich Compositional Embedding Model for Relations</head><p>We propose a general framework to construct an embedding of a sentence with annotations on its component words. While we focus on the relation extraction task, the framework applies to any task that benefits from both embeddings and typical hand-engineered lexical features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Combining Features with Embeddings</head><p>We begin by describing a precise method for constructing substructure embeddings and annotated sentence embeddings from existing (usually unlexicalized) features and embeddings. Note that these embeddings can be included directly in a log-linear model as features-doing so results in a special case of our full model presented in the next subsection. An annotated sentence is first decomposed into substructures. The type of substructures can vary by task; for relation extraction we consider one substructure per word 5 . For each substructure in the sentence we have a hand-crafted feature vector f w i and a dense embedding vector e w i . We represent each substructure as the outer product ? between these two vectors to produce a matrix, herein called a substructure embedding: h w i = f w i ? e w i . The features f w i are based on the local context in S and annotations in A, which can include global information about the annotated sentence. These features allow the model to promote different properties and to distinguish different functions of the words. Feature engineering can be task specific, as relevant annotations can change with regards to each task. In this work we utilize unlexicalized binary features common in relation extraction. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> depicts the construction of a sentence's substructure embeddings.</p><p>We further sum over the substructure embeddings to form an annotated sentence embedding:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e x = n i=1 f w i ? e w i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>When both the hand-crafted features and word embeddings are treated as inputs, as has previously been the case in relation extraction, this annotated sentence embedding can be used directly as the features of a log-linear model. In fact, we find that the feature sets used in prior work for many other NLP tasks are special cases of this simple construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nguyen and Grishman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hermann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth and Woodsend, 2014)</ref>. This highlights an important connection: when the word embeddings are constant, our constructions of substructure and annotated sentence embeddings are just specific forms of polynomial (specifically quadratic) feature combination-hence their commonality in the literature. Our experimental results suggest that such a construction is more powerful than directly including embeddings into the model.</p></div>

We study both the full log-bilinear and the log-linear model obtained by fixing the word embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion of the Model</head><p>Substructure Embeddings Similar words (i.e. those with similar embeddings) with similar functions in the sentence (i.e. those with similar features) will have similar matrix representations. To understand our selection of the outer product, consider the example in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The word "driving" can indicate the ART relation if it appears on the 6 Other popular log-bilinear models are the log-bilinear language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mnih and Hinton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. dependency path between M 1 and M 2 . Suppose the third feature in f w i indicates this on-path feature. Our model can now learn parameters which give the third row a high weight for the ART label. Other words with embeddings similar to "driving" that appear on the dependency path between the mentions will similarly receive high weight for the ART label. On the other hand, if the embedding is similar but is not on the dependency path, it will have 0 weight. Thus, our model generalizes its model parameters across words with similar embeddings only when they share similar functions in the sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smoothed Lexical Features</head><p>Another intuition about the selection of outer product is that it is actually a smoothed version of traditional lexical features used in classical NLP systems. Consider a lexical feature f = u ? w, which is a conjunction (logic-and) between non-lexical property u and lexical part (word) w. If we represent w as a one-hot vector, then the outer product exactly recovers the original feature f . Then if we replace the one-hot representation with its word embedding, we get the current form of our FCM. Therefore, our model can be viewed as a smoothed version of lexical features, which keeps the expressive strength, and uses embeddings to generalize to low frequency features.</p><p>Time Complexity Inference in FCM is much faster than both CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert et al., 2011)</ref> and RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Socher et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bordes et al., 2012)</ref>. FCM requires O(snd) products on average with sparse features, where s is the average number of per-word non-zero feature values, n is the length of the sentence, and d is the dimension of word embedding. In contrast, CNNs and RNNs usually have complexity O(C ? nd 2 ), where C is a model dependent constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Hybrid Model</head><p>We present a hybrid model which combines the FCM with an existing log-linear model. We do so by defining a new model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">p FCM+loglin (y|x) = 1 Z p FCM (y|x)p loglin (y|x) (3)</formula><p>The log-linear model has the usual form: where the indicator function I[x] equals 1 if x is true and 0 otherwise. We have the following gradients:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">p loglin (y|x) ? exp(? ? f (x, y)),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">? ?T = ? ?s ? n i=1 f w i ? e w i , which is equiv- alent to: ? ?T y = I[y = y ] ? P (y |x; T, e) ? n i=1 f w i ? e w i .</formula><p>When we treat the word embeddings as parameters (i.e. the log-bilinear model), we also fine-tune the word embeddings with the FCM model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">? ?e w = n i=1 y ? ?s y T y ? f i ? I[w i = w].</formula><p>As is common in deep learning, we initialize these embeddings from an neural language model and then fine-tune them for our supervised task. The training process for the hybrid model ( ? 4) is also easily done by backpropagation since each sub-model has separate parameters.</p></div>

Combining this with the basic features results in more powerful compound features, which can help us better distinguish the functions of word embeddings for predicting certain relations.

Following prior work we focus on the domain adaptation setting, where we train on one set (the union of the news domains (bn+nw), tune hyperparameters on a dev domain (half of bc) and evaluate on the remainder (cts, wl, and the remainder of bc) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Plank and Moschitti, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nguyen and Grishman, 2014)</ref>.

This task is to determine the relation type (or no relation) between two entities in a sentence. We adopt the setting of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Socher et al. (2012)</ref>. We use 10-fold 8 Many relation extraction systems evaluate on the ACE 2004 corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mitchell et al., 2005)</ref>. Unfortunately, the most common convention is to use 5-fold cross validation, treating the entirety of the dataset as both train and evaluation data. Rather than continuing to overfit this data by perpetuating the cross-validation convention, we instead focus on ACE 2005. 9 http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfvxd49s_36c28v9pmw cross validation on the training data to select hyperparameters and do regularization by early stopping.

In the typical gold entity spans and types setting, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plank and Moschitti (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Nguyen and Grishman (2014)</ref> found that they were unable to obtain improvements by adding embeddings to baseline feature sets. By contrast, we find that on all domains the combination baseline + FCM (5) obtains the highest F1 and significantly outperforms the other baselines, yielding the best reported results for this task. We found that fine-tuning of embeddings (2) did not yield improvements on our out-of-domain development set, in contrast to our results below for SemEval. We suspect this is because fine-tuning allows the model to overfit the training domain, which then hurts performance on the unseen ACE test domains. Accordingly, <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> shows only the log-linear model.</p><p>Finally, we highlight an important contrast between FCM (1) and the log-linear model (3): the latter uses over 50 feature templates based on a POS tagger, dependency parser, chunker, and constituency parser. FCM uses only a dependency parse but still obtains better results (Avg. F1). <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows FCM compared to the best reported results from the SemEval-2010 Task 8 shared task and several other compositional models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SemEval 2010 Task 8</head><p>For the FCM we considered two feature sets. We found that using NE tags instead of WordNet tags helps with fine-tuning but hurts without. This may be because the set of WordNet tags is larger making the model more expressive, but also introduces more parameters. When the embeddings are fixed, they can help to better distinguish different functions of embeddings. But when fine-tuning, it becomes easier to over-fit. Alleviating over-fitting is a subject for future work ( ? 9).</p><p>With either WordNet or NER features, FCM achieves better performance than the RNN and MVRNN.

Our Hybrid methods (FCM + linear) get comparable results to theirs. Note that their base compositional model results without any task-specific enhancements, i.e. RelEmb with word2vec embeddings and CR-CNN with log-loss, are still lower than the best FCM result. We believe that FCM can be also improved with these task-specific enhancements, e.g. replacing the word embeddings to the taskspecific ones from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hashimoto et al., 2015)</ref> increases the result to 83.7% (see ?7.2 for details).

Of note, our FCM and the RelEmb are also the most efficient models among all above compositional models since they have linear time complexity with respect to the dimension of embeddings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Effects of the word embeddings</head><p>Good word embeddings are critical for both FCM and other compositional models. In this section, we show the results of FCM with embeddings used to initialize other recent state-of-the-art models. Those embeddings include the 300-d baseline embeddings trained on English Wikipedia (w2venwiki-d300) and the 100-d task-specific embeddings (task-specific-d100) 10 from the RelEmb paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hashimoto et al., 2015)</ref>, the 400-d embeddings from the CR-CNN paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(dos Santos et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, we list the best result (DepNN) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liu et al. (2015)</ref>, which uses the same embeddings as ours. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref> shows the effects of word embeddings on FCM and provides relative comparisons between FCM and the other state-of-the-art models. We use the same hyperparameters and number of iterations in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. The results show that using different embeddings to initialize FCM can improve F1 beyond our previous results. We also find that increasing the dimension of the word embeddings does not necessarily lead to better results due to the problem of over-fitting (e.g.w2v-enwiki-d400 vs. w2v-enwiki-d300). With the same initial embeddings, FCM usually gets better results without any changes to the hyperparameters than the competing model, further confirming the advantage of FCM at the model-level as discussed under Table 4. The only exception is the DepNN model, which gets better result than FCM on the same embeddings. The task-specific embeddings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hashimoto et al., 2015)</ref> leads to the best performance (an improvement of 0.7%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Related Work</head><p>Compositional Models for Sentences In order to build a representation (embedding) for a sentence based on its component word embeddings and structural information, recent work on compositional models (stemming from the deep learning community) has designed model structures that mimic the structure of the input. For example, these models could take into account the order of the words (as in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collobert et al., 2011)</ref> or build off of an input tree (as in Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) or the Semantic Matching Energy Function) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Socher et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bordes et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>While these models work well on sentence-level representations, the nature of their designs also limits them to fixed types of substructures from the annotated sentence, such as chains for CNNs and trees for RNNs. Such models cannot capture arbitrary combinations of linguistic annotations available for a given task, such as word order, dependency tree, and named entities used for relation extraction. Moreover, these approaches ignore the differences in functions between words appearing in different roles. This does not suit more general substructure labeling tasks in NLP, e.g. these models cannot be directly applied to relation extraction since they will output the same result for any pair of entities in a same sentence.</p><p>Compositional Models with Annotation Features To tackle the problem of traditional compositional models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Socher et al. (2012)</ref> made the RNN model specific to relation extraction tasks by working on the minimal sub-tree which spans the two target entities. However, these specializations to relation extraction does not generalize easily to other tasks in NLP. There are two ways to achieve such specialization in a more general fashion:</p><p>1. Enhancing Compositional Models with Features. A recent trend enhances compositional models with annotation features. Such an approach has been shown to significantly improve over pure compositional models. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hermann et al. (2014)</ref> and Nguyen and Grishman (2014) gave different weights to words with different syntactic context types or to entity head words with different argument IDs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zeng et al. (2014)</ref> use concatenations of embeddings as features in a CNN model, according to their positions relative to the target entity mentions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Belinkov et al. (2014)</ref> enrich embeddings with linguistic features before feeding them forward to a RNN model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Socher et al. (2013a)</ref> and Hermann and Blunsom (2013) enhanced RNN models by refining the transformation matrices with phrase types and CCG super tags.</p><p>2. Engineering of Embedding Features. A different approach to combining traditional linguistic features and embeddings is hand-engineering features with word embeddings and adding them to log-linear models. Such approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in many tasks including NER, chunking, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Miller et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Koo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth and Woodsend, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plank and Moschitti, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roth and Woodsend (2014)</ref> considered features similar to ours for semantic role labeling.</p><p>However, in prior work both of above approaches are only able to utilize limited information, usually one property for each word. Yet there may be different useful properties of a word which can contribute to the performances of the task. By contrast, our FCM can easily utilize these features without changing the model structures.</p><p>In order to better utilize the dependency annotations, recently work built their models according to the dependency paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ma et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>, which share similar motivations to the usage of On-path features in our work.</p><p>Task-Specific Enhancements for Relation Classification An orthogonal direction of improving compositional models for relation classification is to enhance the models with task-specific information. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hashimoto et al. (2015)</ref> trained task-specific word embeddings, and dos <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> proposed a ranking-based loss function for relation classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented FCM, a new compositional model for deriving sentence-level and substructure embeddings from word embeddings. Compared to existing compositional models, FCM can easily handle arbitrary types of input and handle global information for composition, while remaining easy to implement. We have demonstrated that FCM alone attains near state-of-the-art performances on several relation extraction tasks, and in combination with traditional feature based loglinear models it obtains state-of-the-art results.</p><p>Our next steps in improving FCM focus on enhancements based on task-specific embeddings or loss functions as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hashimoto et al. (2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">dos Santos et al. (2015)</ref>. Moreover, as the model provides a general idea for representing both sentences and sub-structures in language, it has the potential to contribute useful components to various tasks, such as dependency parsing, SRL and paraphrasing. Also as kindly pointed out by one anonymous reviewer, our FCM can be applied to the TAC-KBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ji et al., 2010)</ref> tasks, by replacing the training objective to a multi-instance multilabel one (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Surdeanu et al. (2012)</ref>). We plan to explore the above applications of FCM in the future.</p><p>dings will play a more important role. Combination of the baseline and FCM (Baseline + FCM) also achieves improvement but not significantly better than Baseline + HeadOnly. A possible explanation is that FCM becomes less efficient on using context word embeddings when the entity type information is unavailable. In this situation the head embeddings provided by FCM become the dominating contribution to the baseline model, making the model have similar behavior as the Baseline + HeadOnly method.</p><p>Finally, we find Brown clusters can help FCM when entity types are unknown. Although the performance is still not significantly better than Baseline + HeadOnly, it outperforms all the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plank and Moschitti (2013)</ref> as a single model, and with the same source of features. WordNet supersense tags further improves FCM, and achieves the best reported results on this low-resource setting. These results are encouraging since it shows FCM may be more useful under the end-to-end setting where predictions of both entity mentions and relation mentions are required in place of predicting relation based on gold tags <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Li and Ji, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Recently Nguyen et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2015)</ref> proposed a novel way of applying embeddings to tree-kernels. From the results, our best single model achieves comparable result with their best single system, while their combination method is slightly better than ours. This suggests that we may benefit more from combining the usages of multiple word representations; and we will investigate it in future work.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plank and Moschitti (2013)</ref>.

In order to make a fair comparison with their method, we also report the FCM result using Brown clusters (prefixes of length 5) of entity heads as entity types. Furthermore, we report non-comparable settings using Word-Net super-sense tags of entity heads as types. The WordNet features were also used in their paper but not as substitution of entity types. We use the same toolkit to get the WordNet tags as in ?6. The Brown clusters are from <ref type="bibr">(Koo et al., 2008) 11</ref> .</p><p>Results: <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> shows the results under the low-resource setting. When no entity types are available, the performance of our FCM only model greatly decreases to 48.15%, which is consistent with our observation in the ablation tests. The baseline model also relies heavily on the entity types. After we remove all the handengineering features that contain entity type information, the performance of our baseline model drop to 40.62%, even lower than the reduced FCM only model.</p><p>The combination of baseline model and head embeddings (Baseline + HeadOnly) greatly improve the results. This is consistent with the observation in Nguyen and Grishman (2014) that when the gold entity types are unknown, information of the entity heads provided by their embed-</p></div>			</div>
