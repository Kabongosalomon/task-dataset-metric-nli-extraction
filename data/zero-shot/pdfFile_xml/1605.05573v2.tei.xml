Among these tasks, a common problem is modelling the relevance/similarity of the sentence pair, which is also called text semantic matching.</p><p>Recently, deep learning based models is rising a substantial interest in text semantic matching and have achieved some great progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Hu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Qiu and Huang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Wan et al., 2016]</ref>.</p><p>According to the phases of interaction between two sentences, previous models can be classified into three categories.</p><p>Weak interaction Models Some early works focus on sentence level interactions, such as ARC-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Hu et al., 2014]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">CNTN[Qiu and Huang, 2015]</ref> and so on. These models first encode two sequences with some basic (Neural Bagof-words, BOW) or advanced (RNN, CNN) components of neural networks separately, and then compute the matching * Corresponding author. score based on the distributed vectors of two sentences. In this paradigm, two sentences have no interaction until arriving final phase.</p><p>Semi-interaction Models Some improved methods focus on utilizing multi-granularity representation (word, phrase and sentence level), such as MultiGranCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Yin and Sch?tze, 2015]</ref> and Multi-Perspective CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[He et al., 2015]</ref>. Another kind of models use soft attention mechanism to obtain the representation of one sentence by depending on representation of another sentence, such as ABCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Yin et al., 2015]</ref>, Attention LSTM <ref type="bibr">[Rockt?schel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann et al., 2015]</ref>. These models can alleviate the weak interaction problem, but are still insufficient to model the contextualized interaction on the word as well as phrase level.</p><p>Strong Interaction Models These models directly build an interaction space between two sentences and model the interaction at different positions. ARC-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Hu et al., 2014]</ref> and MV-LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Wan et al., 2016]</ref>. These models enable the model to easily capture the difference between semantic capacity of two sentences.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network architecture to model the strong interactions of two sentences. Different with modelling two sentences with separated LSTMs, we utilize two interdependent LSTMs, called coupled-LSTMs, to fully affect each other at different time steps. The output of coupled-LSTMs at each step depends on both sentences. Specifically, we propose two interdependent ways for the coupled-LSTMs: loosely coupled model (LC-LSTMs) and tightly coupled model (TC-LSTMs). Similar to bidirectional LSTM for single sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Schuster and Paliwal, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005]</ref>, there are four directions can be used in coupled-LSTMs. To utilize all the information of four directions of coupled-LSTMs, we aggregate them and adopt a dynamic pooling strategy to automatically select the most informative interaction signals. Finally, we feed them into a fully connected layer, followed by an output layer to compute the matching score.</p><p>The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.</p><p>of two sentences. Our architecture can also capture the multiple granular interactions by several stacked coupled-LSTMs layers.</p><p>2. Compared to the previous works on text matching, we perform extensive empirical studies on two very large datasets. The massive scale of the datasets allows us to train a very deep neural networks. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed architecture is more effective than state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Sentence Modelling with LSTM</head><p>Long short-term memory network (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>] is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Elman, 1990]</ref>, and specifically addresses the issue of learning long-term dependencies. LSTM maintains a memory cell that updates and exposes its content only when deemed necessary. While there are numerous LSTM variants, here we use the LSTM architecture used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Jozefowicz et al., 2015]</ref>, which is similar to the architecture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Graves, 2013]</ref> but without peep-hole connections.</p><p>We define the LSTM units at each time step t to be a collection of vectors in R d : an input gate i t , a forget gate f t , an output gate o t , a memory cell c t and a hidden state h t . d is the number of the LSTM units. The elements of the gating vectors i t , f t and o t are in [0, 1].</p><p>The LSTM is precisely specified as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">? ? ?c t o t i t f t ? ? ? = ? ? ? tanh ? ? ? ? ? ?

Intuitively, the forget gate controls the amount of which each unit of the memory cell is erased, the input gate controls how much each unit is updated, and the output gate controls the exposure of the internal memory state. The update of each LSTM unit can be written precisely as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(h t , c t ) = LSTM(h t?1 , c t?1 , x t ).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, the function LSTM(?, ?, ?) is a shorthand for Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Coupled-LSTMs for Strong Sentence Interaction</head><p>To deal with two sentences, one straightforward method is to model them with two separate LSTMs. However, this method is difficult to model local interactions of two sentences. An improved way is to introduce attention mechanism, which has  been used in many tasks, such as machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Bahdanau et al., 2014]</ref> and question answering <ref type="bibr">[Hermann et al., 2015]</ref>.

Given two sequences X = x 1 , x 2 , ? ? ? , x n and Y = y 1 , y 2 , ? ? ? , y m , we let x i ? R d denote the embedded representation of the word x i . The standard LSTM have one temporal dimension. When dealing with a sentence, LSTM regards the position as time step. At position i of sentence x 1:n , the output h i reflects the meaning of subsequence x 0:i = x 0 , ? ? ? , x i .</p><p>To model the interaction of two sentences as early as possible, we define h i,j to represent the interaction of the subsequences x 0:i and y 0:j . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c) and 1(d) illustrate our two propose models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Loosely Coupled-LSTMs (LC-LSTMs)</head><p>To model the local contextual interactions of two sentences, we enable two LSTMs to be interdependent at different positions. Inspired by Grid LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Kalchbrenner et al., 2015]</ref> and word-by-word attention LSTMs <ref type="bibr">[Rockt?schel et al., 2015]</ref>, we propose a loosely coupling model for two interdependent LSTMs.</p><p>More concretely, we refer to h encoding of subsequence y 0:j in the second LSTM influenced by the output of the first LSTM on subsequence x 0:i h</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(1) i,j and h (2) i,j are computed as h (1) i,j = LSTM 1 (H (1) i?1 , c (1) i?1,j , x i ), (5) h (2) i,j = LSTM 2 (H (2) j?1 , c (2) i,j?1 , y j ), (6) where H (1) i?1 = [h (1) i?1,j , h (2) i?1,j ],<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">H (2) j?1 = [h (1) i,j?1 , h (2) i,j?1 ].<label>(8)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tightly Coupled-LSTMs (TC-LSTMs)</head><p>The hidden states of LC-LSTMs are the combination of the hidden states of two interdependent LSTMs, whose memory cells are separated. Inspired by the configuration of the multidimensional LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Byeon et al., 2015]</ref>, we further conflate both the hidden states and the memory cells of two LSTMs. We assume that h i,j directly model the interaction of the subsequences x 0:i and y 0:j , which depends on two previous interaction h i?1,j and h i,j?1 , where i, j are the positions in sentence X and Y . We define a tightly coupled-LSTMs units as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">? ? ? ? ?c i,j o i,j i i,j f 1 i,j f 2 i,j ? ? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ? tanh ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

T A,b is an affine transformation which depends on parameters of the network A and b. In contrast to the standard LSTM defined over time, each memory unit c i,j of a tightly coupled-LSTMs has two preceding states c i,j?1 and c i?1,j and two corresponding forget gates f 1 i,j and f 2 i,j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Analysis of Two Proposed Models</head><p>Our two proposed coupled-LSTMs can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(hi,j, ci,j) = C-LSTMs(hi?1,j, hi,j?1, ci?1,j, ci,j?1, xi, yj),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where C-LSTMs can be either TC-LSTMs or LC-LSTMs.</p><p>The input consisted of two type of information at step (i, j) in coupled-LSTMs: temporal dimension hi?1,j, hi,j?1, ci?1,j, ci,j?1 and depth dimension xi, yj. The difference between TC-LSTMs and LC-LSTMs is the dependence of information from temporal and depth dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction Between Temporal Dimensions</head><p>The TC-LSTMs model the interactions at position (i, j) by merging the internal memory ci?1,j ci,j?1 and hidden state hi?1,j hi,j?1 along row and column dimensions. In contrast with TC-LSTMs, LC-LSTMs firstly use two standard LSTMs in parallel, producing hidden states h 1 i,j and h 2 i,j along row and column dimensions respectively, which are then merged together flowing next step.</p><p>Interaction Between Depth Dimension In TC-LSTMs, each hidden state hi,j at higher layer receives a fusion of information xi and yj, flowed from lower layer. However, in LC-LSTMs, the information xi and yj are accepted by two corresponding LSTMs at the higher layer separately.</p><p>The two architectures have their own characteristics, TC-LSTMs give more strong interactions among different dimensions while LC-LSTMs ensures the two sequences interact closely without being conflated using two separated LSTMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of LC-LSTMs and word-by-word Attention LSTMs</head><p>The main idea of attention LSTMs is that the representation of sentence X is obtained dynamically based on the alignment degree between the words in sentence X and Y, which is asymmetric unidirectional encoding. Nevertheless, in LC-LSTM, each hidden state of each step is obtained with the consideration of interaction between two sequences with symmetrical encoding fashion.</p><p>4 End-to-End Architecture for Sentence Matching</p><p>In this section, we present an end-to-end deep architecture for matching two sentences, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Embedding Layer</head><p>To model the sentences with neural model, we firstly need transform the one-hot representation of word into the distributed representation. All words of two sequences X = x1, x2, ? ? ? , xn and Y = y1, y2, ? ? ? , ym will be mapped into low dimensional vector representations, which are taken as input of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Stacked Coupled-LSTMs Layers</head><p>After the embedding layer, we use our proposed coupled-LSTMs to capture the strong interactions between two sentences. A basic block consists of five layers. We firstly use four directional coupled-LSTMs to model the local interactions with different information flows. And then we sum the outputs of these LSTMs by aggregation layer. To increase the learning capabilities of the coupled-LSTMs, we stack the basic block on top of each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four Directional Coupled-LSTMs Layers</head><p>The C-LSTMs is defined along a certain pre-defined direction, we can extend them to access to the surrounding context in all directions. Similar to bi-directional LSTM, there are four directions in coupled-LSTMs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(h 1 i,j , c 1 i,j ) = C-LSTMs(hi?1,j, hi,j?1, ci?1,j, ci,j?1, xi, yj), (h 2 i,j , c 2 i,j ) = C-LSTMs(hi?1,j, hi,j+1, ci?1,j, ci,j+1, xi, yj), (h 3 i,j , c 3 i,j ) = C-LSTMs(hi+1,j, hi,j+1, ci+1,j, ci,j+1, xi, yj), (h 4 i,j , c 4 i,j ) = C-LSTMs(hi+1,j, hi,j?1, ci+1,j, ci,j?1, xi, yj).</formula></div>

Inputs are fed to four C-LSTMs followed by an aggregation layer. Blue cuboids represent different contextual information from four directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stacking C-LSTMs Blocks</head><p>To increase the capabilities of network of learning multiple granularities of interactions, we stack several blocks (four C-LSTMs layers and one aggregation layer) to form deep architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Pooling Layer</head><p>The output of stacked coupled-LSTMs layers is a tensor H ? R n?m?d , where n and m are the lengths of sentences, and d is the number of hidden neurons. We apply dynamic pooling to automatically extract R p?q subsampling matrix in each slice Hi ? R n?m , similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Socher et al., 2011]</ref>. More formally, for each slice matrix Hi, we partition the rows and columns of Hi into p ? q roughly equal grids. These grid are non-overlapping. Then we select the maximum value within each grid. Since each slice Hi consists of the hidden states of one neuron at different positions, the pooling operation can be regarded as the most informative interactions captured by the neuron.</p><p>Thus, we get a p ? q ? d tensor, which is further reshaped into a vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Fully-Connected Layer</head><p>The vector obtained by pooling layer is fed into a full connection layer to obtain a final more abstractive representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Output Layer</head><p>The output layer depends on the types of the tasks, we choose the corresponding form of output layer. There are two popular types of text matching tasks in NLP. One is ranking task, such as community question answering. Another is classification task, such as textual entailment. 1. For ranking task, the output is a scalar matching score, which is obtained by a linear transformation after the last fullyconnected layer.</p><p>2. For classification task, the outputs are the probabilities of the different classes, which is computed by a softmax function after the last fully-connected layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Training</head><p>Our proposed architecture can deal with different sentence matching tasks. The loss functions varies with different tasks.</p><p>Max-Margin Loss for Ranking Task Given a positive sentence pair (X, Y ) and its corresponding negative pair (X,? ). The matching score s(X, Y ) should be larger than s(X,? ).</p><p>For this task, we use the contrastive max-margin criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Bordes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Socher et al., 2013]</ref> to train our models on matching task.  The ranking-based loss is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L(X, Y,? ) = max(0, 1 ? s(X, Y ) + s(X,? )).<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where s(X, Y ) is predicted matching score for (X, Y ).</p><p>Cross-entropy Loss for Classification Task Given a sentence pair (X, Y ) and its label l. The outputl of neural network is the probabilities of the different classes. The parameters of the network are trained to minimise the cross-entropy of the predicted and true label distributions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L(X, Y ; l,l) = ? C j=1 lj log(lj),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where l is one-hot representation of the ground-truth label l;l is predicted probabilities of labels; C is the class number. To minimize the objective, we use stochastic gradient descent with the diagonal variant of AdaGrad <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Duchi et al., 2011]</ref>. To prevent exploding gradients, we perform gradient clipping by scaling the gradient when the norm exceeds a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Graves, 2013]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiment</head><p>In this section, we investigate the empirical performances of our proposed model on two different text matching tasks: classification task (recognizing textual entailment) and ranking task (matching of question and answer).</p></div>

Moreover, we can see TC-LSTMs achieve better performance than LC-LSTMs on this task, which need fine-grained reasoning over pairs of words as well as phrases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding Behaviors of Neurons in C-LSTMs</head><p>To get an intuitive understanding of how the C-LSTMs work on this problem, we examined the neuron activations in the last aggregation layer while evaluating the test set using TC-LSTMs. We find that some cells are bound to certain roles.</p><p>Let h i,j,k denotes the activation of the k-th neuron at the position of (i, j), where i ? {1, . . . , n} and j ? {1, . . . , m}. By visualizing the hidden state h i,j,k and analyzing the maximum activation, we can find that there exist multiple interpretable neurons. For example, when some contextualized local perspectives are semantically related at point (i, j) of the sentence pair, the activation value of hidden neuron h i,j,k tend to be maximum, meaning that the model could capture some reasoning patterns. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates this phenomenon. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3(a)</ref>, a neuron shows its ability to monitor the local contextual interactions about color. The activation in the patch, including the word pair "(red, green)", is much higher than others. This is informative pattern for the relation prediction of these two sentences, whose ground truth is contradiction. An interesting thing is there are two words describing color in the sentence " A person in a red shirt and black pants hunched over.". Our model ignores the useless word "black", which indicates that this neuron selectively captures pattern by contextual understanding, not just word level interaction.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 3(b)</ref>, another neuron shows that it can capture the local contextual interactions, such as "(walking down the street, outside)". These patterns can be easily captured by pooling layer and provide a strong support for the final prediction. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> illustrates multiple interpretable neurons and some representative word or phrase pairs which can activate these neurons. These cases show that our models can capture contextual interactions beyond word level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Error Analysis</head><p>Although our models C-LSTMs are more sensitive to the discrepancy of the semantic capacity between two sentences, some Index of Cell Word or Phrase Pairs 3-th (in a pool, swimming), (near a fountain, next to the ocean), (street, outside) 9-th (doing a skateboard, skateboarding), (sidewalk with, inside), (standing, seated) 17-th (blue jacket, blue jacket), (wearing black, wearing white), (green uniform, red uniform) 25-th (a man, two other men), (a man, two girls), (an old woman, two people)  semantic mistakes at the phrasal level still exist. For example, our models failed to capture the key informative pattern when predicting the entailment sentence pair "A girl takes off her shoes and eats blue cotton candy/The girl is eating while barefoot." Besides, despite the large size of the training corpus, it's still very different to solve some cases, which depend on the combination of the world knowledge and context-sensitive inferences. For example, given an entailment pair "a man grabs his crotch during a political demonstration/The man is making a crude gesture", all models predict "neutral". This analysis suggests that some architectural improvements or external world knowledge are necessary to eliminate all errors instead of simply scaling up the basic model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Experiment-II: Matching Question and Answer</head><p>Matching question answering (MQA) is a typical task for semantic matching. Given a question, we need select a correct answer from some candidate answers.</p><p>In this paper, we use the dataset collected from Yahoo! Answers with the getByCategory function provided in Yahoo! Answers API, which produces 963, 072 questions and corresponding best answers. We then select the pairs in which the length of questions and answers are both in the interval <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">30]</ref>, thus obtaining 220, 000 question answer pairs to form the positive pairs.</p><p>For negative pairs, we first use each question's best answer as a query to retrieval top 1, 000 results from the whole answer set with Lucene, where 4 or 9 answers will be selected randomly to construct the negative pairs.</p><p>The whole dataset is divided into training, validation and testing data with proportion 20 : 1 : 1. Moreover, we give two test settings: selecting the best answer from 5 and 10 candidates respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results of MQA are shown in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. For our models, due to stacking block more than three layers can not make significant improvements on this task, we just use three stacked C-LSTMs.</p><p>By analyzing the evaluation results of question-answer matching in table 4, we can see strong interaction models (attention LSTMs, our C-LSTMs) consistently outperform the weak interaction models (NBOW, parallel LSTMs) with a large margin, which suggests the importance of modelling strong interaction of two sentences.</p><p>Our proposed two C-LSTMs surpass the competitor methods and C-LSTMs augmented with multi-directions layers and multiple stacked blocks fully utilize multiple levels of abstraction to directly boost the performance.</p><p>Additionally, LC-LSTMs is superior to TC-LSTMs. The reason may be that MQA is a relative simple task, which requires less reasoning abilities, compared with RTE task. Moreover, the parameters of LC-LSTMs are less than TC-LSTMs, which ensures the former can avoid suffering from overfitting on a relatively smaller corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Our architecture for sentence pair encoding can be regarded as strong interaction models, which have been explored in previous models.</p><p>An intuitive paradigm is to compute similarities between all the words or phrases of the two sentences. Socher et al. <ref type="bibr">[2011]</ref> firstly used this paradigm for paraphrase detection. The representations of words or phrases are learned based on recursive autoencoders. Wan et al. <ref type="bibr">[2016]</ref> used LSTM to enhance the positional contextual interactions of the words or phrases between two sentences. The input of LSTM for one sentence does not involve another sentence.</p><p>A major limitation of this paradigm is the interaction of two sentence is captured by a pre-defined similarity measure. Thus, it is not easy to increase the depth of the network. Compared with this paradigm, we can stack our C-LSTMs to model multiple-granularity interactions of two sentences.</p><p>Rockt?schel et al. <ref type="bibr">[2015]</ref> used two LSTMs equipped with attention mechanism to capture the iteration between two sentences. This architecture is asymmetrical for two sentences, where the obtained final representation is sensitive to the two sentences' order.</p><p>Compared with the attentive LSTM, our proposed C-LSTMs are symmetrical and model the local contextual interaction of two sequences directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture to capture the strong interaction information of sentence pair. Experiments on two large scale text matching tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model and its superiority to competitor models. Besides, our visualization analysis revealed that multiple interpretable neurons in our proposed models can capture the contextual interactions of the words or phrases.</p><p>In future work, we would like to incorporate some gating strategies into the depth dimension of our proposed models, like highway or residual network, to enhance the interactions between depth and other dimensions thus training more deep and powerful neural networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Four different coupled-LSTMs.</figDesc></figure>
