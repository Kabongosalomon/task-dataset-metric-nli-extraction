<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A recent flourishing area of research is that of Schur-like functions, whose properties are analogous to the ubiquitous Schur functions that arise in many areas, from enumerative combinatorics where they are generating functions for Young tableaux, to representation theory where they are the irreducible representations for the general linear groups, as well as being intimately connected to representations of the symmetric group.</p><p>The area of Schur-like functions began with quasisymmetric Schur functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[12]</ref>, followed by discoveries of row-strict quasisymmetric Schur functions <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, Young quasisymmetric Schur functions <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">17]</ref>, noncommutative Schur functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and immaculate functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, quasisymmetric Schur Q-functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[14]</ref>, quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>, and Schur functions in noncommuting variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper and its companion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref>, we introduce a new family of quasisymmetric functions, the row-strict dual immaculate functions. Our focus in the present work is the study of the associated 0-Hecke algebra modules, which we define and analyse in order to develop the analogy with Schur functions in the representation theory context. This programme was first carried out for the dual immaculate functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the quasisymmetric Schur functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref>, and subsequently for the row-strict Young quasisymmetric functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the extended Schur functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In further analogy with Schur functions, the row-strict dual immaculate functions RS * ? are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref> as generating functions for certain types of tableaux of composition shape ?; by identifying the correct descent set, it follows that the functions RS * ? expand positively in the basis of fundamental quasisymmetric functions, and are the image, under the involutive algebra automorphism ? of the Hopf algebra QSym of quasisymmetric functions, of the well-studied dual immaculate functions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The descent set determines a 0-Hecke algebra action on the set SIT(?) of standard immaculate tableaux of composition shape ?, yielding a cyclic indecomposable module whose quasisymmetric characteristic is RS * ? . The action defines a partial order on the set SIT(?) which turns out to be dual to the partial order in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, see Lemma 6.2. The resulting graded poset P RS * (?), which we call the immaculate Hecke poset, has remarkable properties, leading to the discovery of several other 0-Hecke modules with interesting quasisymmetric characteristics. Among these is an analogue of the extended Schur functions defined by Assaf and Searles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. An examination of the poset (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 2</ref>) reveals various subposets that are closed under either our action or the dual immaculate action of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We investigate the associated submodules.</p><p>One of the key contributions of this paper, then, is the careful scrutiny of the partial order resulting originally from the 0-Hecke algebra action defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and the discovery that hidden within it are special standard immaculate tableaux, which generate interesting 0-Hecke algebra submodules and quotient modules, for both the dual immaculate action and our new row-strict dual immaculate action. The duality in the poset reflects the action of the involution ? on QSym: we prove first that the poset is graded, and has unique top and bottom elements, see Definition 6.3 and Definition 6.9. The cyclic generator for the dual immaculate module was shown to be the top element in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; for the row-strict dual immaculate module, we show that the cyclic generator is the bottom element of the poset. Similarly, the cyclic generators for the extended Schur Hecke-module of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref> and our row-strict extended Schur Hecke-module (see Theorem 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">13</ref>) are the top and bottom elements of the interval [S col ? , S row ? ], the column superstandard and row superstandard tableaux of Definition 7.7 and Definition 6.9, respectively. Finally we show how another special standard tableau S row * ? , see Definition 8.2, also generates a cyclic submodule of the dual immaculate 0-Hecke algebra module. The poset duality phenomenon can also be used to explain, for example, the passage between the modules in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, see Section 8.</p><p>Our proofs are technical, relying heavily on two straightening algorithms which produce saturated chains in the poset P RS * (?). We prove indecomposability by following the pioneering work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, with considerable technical modifications.</p><p>The paper is organised as follows. The basic definitions regarding quasisymmetric functions appear in Section 2, which also includes the facts that we need about dual immaculate functions. Our new family of row-strict dual immaculate functions is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we briefly review the necessary facts about 0-Hecke algebras, and then define a new 0-Hecke algebra action on standard immaculate tableaux. Section 5 describes a partial order on these tableaux, which, by standard arguments, leads to a filtration showing that our 0-Hecke module has quasisymmetric characteristic equal to the row-strict dual immaculate function. Section 6 is devoted to showing that our new 0-Hecke module is cyclic (Theorem 6.8) and indecomposable, culminating in Theorem 6.14. The technicalities here hinge on two key straightening algorithms, described in Propositions 6.6 and 6.11, which we use to establish that the poset of Section 5 is bounded, with a unique minimal and maximal element. The minimal element, defined in Definition 6.3, is shown to be the cyclic generator of our module. The maximal element is the cyclic generator of the module of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The straightening algorithms play an important role in the technical lemmas leading to the indecomposability proof. The work of this section also reveals a remarkable connection, see Lemma 6.2, between our partial order and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, showing how the map ? between the quasisymmetric characteristics of the dual immaculate and row-strict dual immaculate modules, is reflected in the duality of the posets.</p><p>The motivation for Section 7 and Section 8 comes from a closer examination of the poset of standard immaculate tableaux defined by the 0-Hecke action, and the remarkable properties to which we have alluded above. In Section 7 we show how the poset reveals a 0-Hecke module whose characteristic is the row-strict analogue of the extended Schur function defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, for which a 0-Hecke module was constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>. In fact we show that there are not one but two related modules, a submodule (Theorem 7.13) and a quotient module (Theorem 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">19)</ref> of the row-strict dual immaculate action, both cyclic and indecomposable. To complete this analogy, in Section 8 we show once again how the poset of standard immaculate tableaux leads to the discovery of more cyclic modules, a submodule and two quotient modules of the (original) dual immaculate action, as well as a quotient module of the extended rowstrict dual immaculate module (Theorem 8.5, Theorem 8.8). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 2</ref> indicates the essential representation-theoretic properties of the immaculate Hecke poset.</p><p>We conclude in Section 9 by considering the two remaining choices for the descent set of a standard immaculate tableau, apart from the two which determine the dual immaculate and row-strict dual immaculate functions. Although the corresponding quasisymmetric functions are no longer independent, interestingly, both of the new variants come with associated 0-Hecke actions. Furthermore, these actions determine the same immaculate Hecke poset, and consequently our straightening algorithms apply, giving cyclic 0-Hecke modules as in Section 6, generated respectively by S 0 ? and S row ? , as well as submodules generated respectively by S col ? and S row * ? as in Section 7 and Section 8. Our final result, Theorem 9.16, shows that these modules complete the combinatorial picture of tableaux considered in this paper, by accounting for all the possible variations on increasing rows and columns.

The first claim is immediate from the definitions.</p><p>For the second claim, one direction is clear: if i + 1 is right-adjacent to i, clearly swapping i and i + 1 will make a non-increasing row, so ? i (T ) = 0. Now suppose i ? Des RS * (T ) and i, i + 1 are not in the same row, so that i + 1 is in a row strictly below i. Here it is clear that swapping i, i + 1 does not violate row-increase (since</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">a &lt; i &lt; b ?? a &lt; i + 1 &lt; b for a, b / ? {i, i + 1}).</formula><p>Since by the first claim, i, i + 1 are not both in the leftmost column, the latter is still increasing by the same argument.

Example 6.7. Let ? = 223, so that S 0 ? = 3 4 5 2 6 1 7</p><p>, and let T = 5 6 7 2 4 1 3</p><p>. First we straighten column 1 of T to match column 1 of S 0 ? : Start with the top-most entry a j in column 1 of T such that a j = j, and replace it with a j ? 1. Continue in this manner until column 1 has the entries 3, 2, 1 from top to bottom.</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">T = T 0 ? 4 ?? T 1 = 4 6 7 2 5 1 3 ? 3 ??

T 3 =</formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">T 6 ? 6 ?? T 7 = 3 4 5 2 6 1 7 = S 0 ? .</formula><p>Hence we have T = ? 4 ? 3 ? 5 ? 4 ? 6 ? 5 ? 6 (S 0 ? ).</p><p>Proof of Proposition 6.6. As illustrated by Example 6.7, the following algorithm identifies a unique saturated chain from S 0 ? to T. In what follows, when an integer a occupies row i and column j of T, by the counterpart of a in S 0 ? we will mean the integer occupying the same cell, row i and column j, in S 0 ? .</p><p>Step 1: We begin by making the first column of T match the first column of S 0 ? . Find the least j, 2 ? j ? ?, such that the entry x in cell (j, 1) is not equal to j. Then x ? 1 is in a lower row, not in column 1 by minimality of j. Hence T = ? x?1 (T 1 ), such that in T 1 ? SIT(?), x ? 1 is now a descent strictly higher than x. Now repeat this procedure until x is replaced by j. Then continue with the next entry in column 1 of T which does not match in S 0 ? . Clearly this process ends with a tableau T r = ? xr ? x r?1 . . . ? x 1 (T ), whose first column matches column 1 of S 0 ? . Note that T = T r if T and S 0 ? already agree in the first column.</p><p>Step 2: First observe that T r and S 0 ? now agree for all entries less than or equal to ? = ?(?). Now consider the top-most row of length greater than 1, say row k. Find the least entry, say y, in this row of T r which differs from the corresponding entry in S 0 ? . Note that y is then necessarily larger than its counterpart in S 0 ? , by definition of the latter. Then y ? ? + 1 and y ? 1 is strictly below y in T r . Hence T r = ? y?1 (T r+1 ) for T r+1 ? SIT(?), such that y ? 1 is a descent in T r+1 strictly higher than y. We repeat this step until y has been replaced by its counterpart in S 0 ? .</p><p>Step 3: Continue in this manner to the end of the row. We now have a sequence of operators ? i j and tableaux T j ? SIT(?) such that T j?1 = ? i j (T j ), and the final tableaux T s agrees with S 0 ? for all entries ? ? + (? k ? 1). Step 4: Proceed downwards to the next row where an entry in T s differs from its counterpart in S 0 ? , and repeat Steps 2 and 3, until all rows are exhausted. Since at the end of each iteration of Step 3, the number of entries that are in agreement with S 0 ? increases, we see that the algorithm produces a saturated chain from S 0 ? to T in the poset P RS * ? as claimed.</p><p>We now immediately have: Theorem 6.8. The module V(T 1 ) = ch ?1 (RS * ? ) of Theorem 5.5 is cyclic, and generated by the unique minimal element S 0 ? of the poset P RS * ? .</p><p>Proof. This is clear since Proposition 6.6 shows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">T ? SIT(?), T = S 0 ? ? S 0 ? RS *</formula><p>? T, and also that there is a permutation ? ? S n such that T = ? ?

Before proceeding with our analysis of the structure of V ? , some remarks on the analogous results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are in order. There the existence of the unique top element of P S * ? is implicitly deduced via a map between an analogue of Yamanouchi words which they call Y-words, which are in bijection with standard tableaux. The authors show indirectly that the top element of the poset P S * ? ? P RS * ? is a cyclic generator for the module ch ?1 (S * ? ), by appealing to a parent module generated by a special Yamanouchi word; they invoke the fact that ch ?1 (S * ? ) is a quotient of this module. In order to give a complete and self-contained analysis of the immaculate Hecke poset P S * ? ? P RS * ? , we will explicitly establish the existence of the unique top element by means of a straightening algorithm similar to Proposition 6.6. We will also be able to deduce that the H n (0)-module ch ?1 (S * ? ) is cyclically generated by this top element. Definition 6.9. Define S row ? to be the row superstandard tableau in SIT(?), whose entries bottom to top, left to right, are 1, 2, . . . , n ? 1, n in consecutive order. Note that if ? is a hook of the form (1 ??1 , n ? ? + 1), 1 ? ? ? n, then SIT(?) has cardinality one and S 0 ? = S row ? . . Proposition 6.11. Let ? n and consider the standard immaculate tableau S row ? . Then for any T ? SIT(?), T = S row ? , there is a sequence of generators ? j i , and tableaux T i ? SIT(?), i = 1, . . . , r, such that ? j i (T i?1 ) = T i , i = 1, 2, . . . , r, where we set T 0 = T and T r = S row ? . Hence we conclude T RS * ? S row ? and ? jr ? j r?1 ? ? ? ? j 1 (T ) = S row ? . In particular S row ? is the unique maximal element of the poset P RS * ? .</p><p>We illustrate the straightening algorithm with an example. Example 6.12. We have S row 223 = 5 6 7 3 4 1 2</p><p>. Let T = T 0 = 3 4 7 2 6 1 5</p><p>. Start with the largest entry in the top-most row of T that differs from its counterpart in S row 223 , and repeat:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">T 0 ? 4 ?? 3 5 7 2 6 1 4 = T 1 ? 5 ?? 3 6 7 2 5 1 4 = T 2 ? 3 ?? 4 6 7 2 5 1 3 = T 3 ? 4 ?? 5 6 7 2 4 1 3 = T 4 .</formula><p>Once the top row coincides in both, move down to the next row where there is disagreement, again starting with the largest such element in that row:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">T 4 ? 2 ?? 5 6 7 3 4 1 2 = S row ? .</formula><p>Hence ? 2 ? 4 ? 3 ? 5 ? 4 (T ) = S row ? .</p><p>Proof of Proposition 6.11. In this case the algorithm is simpler to describe. We start with the top-most row of T which differs from S row ? , and find the largest entry, say x, in that row which differs from its counterpart in S row ? . Then necessarily x + 1 is in a lower row of T = T 0 , and hence T 1 = ? x (T 0 ) for the tableau T 1 ? SIT(?) obtained from T by switching x, x + 1.

That is, f (S 0 ? ) = T a T T does not contain P in its expansion, and hence a P = 0. It follows that a P = 0 unless Des RS * (P ) is contained in Des RS * (S 0 ? ), which equals the complement of [? ? 1] from Equation <ref type="formula">(14)</ref>. In particular, a P = 0 unless 1, . . . , ? ? 1 are NOT descents of P. But then it is easy to see (since rows must increase left to right) that 1, . . . , ? must occupy the first column of P.

(P ) swaps ? and ? + 1. That is, in P 1 = ? ? (P ), ? is now right-adjacent to i ? ? ? 1 If i = ? ? 1, the argument stops here. If not, now ? is strictly below ? ? 1, and hence applying ? ??1 produces a tableau s ??1 (P 1 ) in which ? ? 1 is now right-adjacent to i ? ? ? 2. Clearly we can continue this process until i + 1 becomes right-adjacent to i, with the appropriate replacements in the first column above the entry i, producing the saturated chain as claimed.

This is clear from the preceding proof, since it takes (? ? i) consecutive applications of the ? j to make i + 1 right-adjacent to i in P ; applying ? ? , ? ??1 , . . . , ? i successively to Q changes the first column, and, in column 2, it changes only the entry in row j right-adjacent to j, diminishing the latter by 1 at each step. Hence after applying the (? ? i + 1) factors in ? ? ,, the entry right-adjacent to j in Q is i, and this is greater than j by hypothesis. This means that one final application of ? i gives ? ? (P ) = 0, but ? ? (Q) = 0.

Let ? n, ?(?) = ?, and let P ? SIT * (?), P = S 0 ? be such that for all j, whenever j, j + 1 are right-adjacent in S 0 ? , they are also right-adjacent in P.

S 0 ? ) replaces p with ? + 1, by diminishing it by 1 at each step, making ? + 1 right-adjacent to j in P (resp. right-adjacent to i in S 0 ? .) When p = ? + 1, ? is the identity since ? + 1 is already right-adjacent to j in P (resp. right-adjacent to i in S 0 ? ), with i &gt; j; this is because ? + 1 is already in a lower row in P than in S 0 ? .</p><p>Proof. Note first that the hypothesis includes the case when there is no j such that j, j + 1 are right-adjacent in S 0 ? . This forces all parts of ? to be at most 2. Item (1) is clear. Item (2) follows by hypothesis, since all the entries of S 0 ? are consecutive beginning in column 1 for the top row.</p><p>Rows of length ? 3 have consecutive entries from column 2 onwards in both tableaux, by hypothesis. The entry in column 2 of such a row is uniquely determined by any other entry in that row, and hence the least entry that differs must occur in column 2. This is Item (3).</p><p>Item <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> is clear by minimality of the entry p in cell x, since all entries in S 0 ? occurring to the left of cell x, or higher than it, must be less than p. Also rows increase left to right, so in P , if the entry p were not in column 2, there would be an entry q, ? + 1 ? q &lt; p, immediately to its left in its row. But this contradicts the fact that all entries strictly less than p occupy exactly the same cells in both tableaux. This establishes Item <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Now note that when p = ? + 1, Item <ref type="formula">(6)</ref> is immediate for ? equal to the identity permutation. See Example 6.23 with P replaced with ? 10 (P ). Thus we may assume p ? ? + 2.</p><p>It is now clear from Example 6.22 what happens; applying ? p?1 puts p ? 1 into the position formerly occupied by p, in cell (j, 2), of P , j &lt; i, and moves p UP to the cell formerly occupied by p ? 1. But in S 0 ? , it puts p ? 1 in cell (i, 2), and moves p to the same cell as in P . This is by virtue of Item (4).</p><p>Similarly, applying ? p?2 next will move p ? 2 into the position (j, 2), and p ? 1 will now move UP. In S 0 ? , it puts p ? 2 into cell (i, 2) and moves p ? 1 into the same cell as in P.</p><p>In fact a comparison of the two tableaux after each application of ? k shows that they coincide in all rows above the ith row and they differ in rows i and j, in column 2.</p><p>The first step of our induction is depicted in Example 6.25 below. Subsequent steps are completely analogous, with p diminished by 1 at each step.</p><p>Assume by induction that after applying ? p?k , (p ? k) was in cell (j, 2) of P and in cell (i, 2) of S 0 ? , (recall j &lt; i) and the two tableaux coincide in rows above row i. By induction hypothesis, p ? k ? 1 occupies the same cell in each tableau, since it is in a row higher than row i. Now apply ? p?k?1 . This swaps p ? k ? 1 and p ? k in each tableau, putting p ? k ? 1 into cell (j, 2) of P and in cell (i, 2) of S 0 ? , and moving p ? k UP to the same cell in both tableaux.</p><p>In P, cell (j, 2) changes p to ? + 1. In S 0 ? , cell (i, 2) changes from p to ? + 1. We have thus established Item <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.

In that paper, Searles constructs an H n (0)-module whose quasisymmetric characteristic is the extended Schur function E ? defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We restate Searles' formulation of their theorem as follows: Recall from Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> that ? is the QSym-involution which sends the fundamental quasisymmetric function F ? to F ? c , where ? c is the complement of the composition ?. See also <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 3.6]</ref>. We now immediately have the following:</p><p>Proposition 7.6. Write RE ? for the characteristic of the H n (0)-submodule Z ? .

It follows that our row-strict extended Schur functions RE ? also give rise to a dual basis of NSym, which we may call the Rshin basis.</p><p>In analogy with the row superstandard tableau S row ? of Definition 6.9, we make the following Definition 7.7. Let S col ? ? SET(?) denote the column superstandard tableau of shape ?, whose columns are filled bottom to top and left to right, beginning with the first column, with the numbers {1, 2, . . . , n} taken in consecutive order. As before we note that if ? is a hook of the form (1 ??1 , n ? ?), 1 ? ? ? n, then SIT(?) has cardinality one and S 0 ? = S row ? = S col ? .</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 2</ref>, S col ? is the lowest-ranked tableau in red. As observed previously, S row ? is the top element of the poset P RS * ? , and hence also of the subposet SET(?). We show next that the module Z ? is cyclic and indecomposable. The following observation is key: Proof. First note that i must be in Des RS * (T ), and in fact i + 1 is strictly below i in T. The proof of Lemma 7.2 shows, by definition of ? i , that T and S must coincide for all entries not equal to i, i + 1. Since switching i, i + 1 does not affect the increase of their respective columns, it follows that T, like S, must have all columns increasing. Proof. Let T ? SET(?), T = S col ? . We claim that the straightening algorithm of Proposition 6.6 can be modified to show that there is a sequence of generators ? j i , and tableaux T i ? SET(?), i = 1, . . . , r, such that ? j i (T i ) = T i?1 , i = 1, 2, . . . , r, where we set T 0 = T and T r = S col ? . Note that S col ? ? SIT * (?) ? SET(?), i.e. the first column of S col ? consists of the entries [?]. We begin by following Step 1 of the straightening algorithm of Proposition 6.6, which shows how to generate a tableau T 1 and a saturated chain in the interval [T 1 , T ] of the poset P RS * ? , such that T 1 has the same entries [?] in column 1. Lemma 7.8 guarantees that the elements of this chain are in fact in SET(?).</p><p>We describe the inductive step. Once the first k ? 1 columns have been matched, we proceed to the kth column. Here we diverge from the proof of Proposition 6.6, and instead continue the procedure of Step 1. Let j be the largest entry such that T and S col ? coincide for all entries i ? j. Then j ? n ? 2, and T and S col ? coincide for all entries weakly below or to the left of j in S col ? . Note that j cannot be the top-most entry in its column, because this would force j + 1 into the bottom cell of the next column, and this in turn would contradict the maximality of j. Let x be the entry immediately above j in T. By hypothesis x &gt; j + 1, and x ? 1 is strictly to the right, and hence also below, x in T. Hence T = ? x?1 (T ? ), T ? ? SET(?) by Lemma 7.8, and now the first disagreement between T ? and S col ? has been diminished by 1. This inductive step is repeated until the original entry x is replaced with j + 1, so that now our tableau coincides with S col ? for all entries i ? j + 1. Since the number of entries in agreement with S col ? increases at the end of each such step, continuing in this manner produces the saturated chain in [S col ? , T ] as claimed. The statement of the lemma now follows.</p><p>The subposet SET(223) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 2</ref> is very small. We illustrate the preceding straightening algorithm with two larger examples, using ? = 232. = S col 232 , and thus T = ? 2 ? 5 ? 4 ? 3 ? 6 (S col 232 ). = S col 232 , and thus T = ? 2 ? 4 ? 3 ? 6 (S col 232 ).</p><p>Lemma 7.12. Let P ? SET(?), P = S col ? . Then there is a j ? [n?1] such that ? j (S col ? ) = S col ? but ? j (P ) = P.</p><p>Proof. By definition of the RS * -action, for any T ? SET(?), we have ? j (T ) = T ?? j ? Des RS * (T ). In particular, the definition of S col ? implies that ? j (S col ? ) = S col ? ?? j is at the top of a column in S col ? .</p><p>Let P ? SET(?), P = S col ? . Let j be the largest entry such that P and S col ? coincide for all entries i ? j. Then j ? n ? 2, and P and S col ? coincide for all entries weakly below or to the left of j in S col ? . Hence, in P , j + 1 must be strictly to the right of j; it cannot be in the same column as j by maximality of j and the fact that P is increasing in rows and in columns. This also forces j + 1 to be either strictly below j or right-adjacent to j in P . In particular j ? Des RS * (P ), and hence ? j (P ) = s j (P ) = P or ? j (P ) = 0 = P .</p><p>If j ? Des RS * (S col ? ) then j must be at the top of some column of S col ? , but in that case, since rows and columns are increasing in SET(?), j + 1 must be at the bottom of the next column in both S col ? and P. This contradicts the maximality of j. Hence j / ? Des RS * (S col ? ) and ? j (S col ? ) = S col ? .</p><p>Theorem 7.13. The cyclic H n (0)-submodule Z ? of V ? is indecomposable.</p><p>Proof. Let f be an idempotent H n (0)-module endomorphism of Z ? . Our starting point here is the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">f (S col ? ) = T ?SET(?) a T T.</formula><p>Lemma 7.12 is the analogue of [5, Lemma 3.11]. To make our work self-contained, we reproduce the brief argument in [5, Theorem 3.12]. Let P ? SET(?), P = S col ? ; we claim that a P = 0. Let j be the integer guaranteed by Lemma 7.12 for this P, and apply ? j to the preceding equation. We then have, since ? j fixes S col ? , f (S col ? ) = f (? j (S col ? )) = T ?SET(?) a T ? j (T ), but P = ? j (P ), so P does not appear in the right-hand side by Lemma 6.15. Hence P does not appear in the expansion of f (S col ? ), i.e. a P = 0. We conclude that f (S col ? ) equals a scalar multiple of S col ? , which can only be 0 or 1 since f is idempotent.</p><p>Next we examine the quotient module V ? /Z ? arising from the submodule Z ? of V ? .</p><p>Definition 7.14. Let NSET(?) be the set of all standard tableaux of shape ? in which all rows increase left to right, but at least one column does NOT increase from bottom to top.</p><p>Lemma 7.15. The quotient moduleV ? := V ? /Z ? is also an H n (0)-module for the RS *action, with basis NSET(?) ? SIT(?).

The first statement is clear, since a basis for the quotient module is the complement of SET(?) in SIT(?), which is empty if ? has at most one part of size greater than or equal 2; recall that the first column is always increasing by definition of SIT(?).

This will require a careful analysis of the technical lemmas in Section 6. In particular, we need to show that the analogue of Lemma 6.26 holds.</p><p>Lemma 7.20. Let P = S 0 ? , such that P ? NSET(?) ? SIT * (?). Assume ? has at least three parts of size greater than or equal to 2. Then there is a permutation ? = s i 1 ? ? ? s ir such that (1) ? ? (S 0 ? ) = 0; (2) ? ? (P ) is nonzero and has rank r + rank(P ) in the subposet P RS * ? ? NSET(?) ? SIT * (?).</p><p>Proof. We follow the argument of Lemma 6.26: again, we may assume that whenever j, j + 1 are adjacent in S 0 ? , they are also adjacent in P. Now we need the analogues of Lemma 6.18, Lemma 6.20 and Lemma 6.24. It is enough to show that each of these lemmas holds when P ? NSET(?) ? SIT * (?).</p><p>In that case, note first that if column 2 of P increases bottom to top, then there must be a non-increasing column, column j, for j ? 3. The important observation is that in each of the three lemmas, Lemma 6.18, Lemma 6.20 and Lemma 6.24, the algorithms described in the proofs affect only the first two columns of the tableau P. Hence we need only address the case when column 2 of P (is the only column which) does NOT increase from bottom to top.</p><p>Consider Lemma 6.18 and the algorithm which produces the saturated chain in the statement. It is clear that if ? + 1 is right-adjacent to i ? ? ? 1 in P , then the algorithm affects only columns 1 and 2, and furthermore in column 2 it changes only the entry in the cell (i, 2), diminishing it each time by 1. Clearly if i ? 2, all entries below row i in column 2 are greater than ? + 1, and hence the algorithm preserves the fact that column 2 is NOT increasing bottom to top. If i = 1, then in column 2 above the first row there must be entries x &lt; y such that x is in a higher row than y. But these entries are untouched by the algorithm, so the intermediate tableaux in the saturated chain are all in NSET(?).</p><p>The analogous analysis for Lemma 6.20 brings us to the same conclusion.</p><p>Finally we examine Lemma 6.24. This is somewhat more intricate. Note that we have assumed ? has at least three parts greater than 1. It is also clear from the proof of Lemma 6.24 that once again, the algorithm only affects the first two columns. As before, we assume column 2 of P is NOT increasing.</p><p>Let p be the smallest entry in S 0 ? where there is disagreement with P, and say it is in cell (i, 2). Then P has an entry z, z &gt; p in this cell, (i, 2), and p appears in P in cell (j, 2) for j &lt; i. Again as in the proof of Lemma 6.24, we may assume p ? ? + 2. The algorithm of Lemma 6.24 successively replaces P with ? j (P ) for some j. Our claim is that the second column of ? j (P ) continues to be non-increasing, i.e. at each step, ? j (P ) ? NSET(?).</p><p>Consulting Example 6.25, we note that all rows above row i coincide in both S 0 ? and in P, and that if the second column of P is non-decreasing, clearly the same is true of ? p?1 (P ). At each step the entry in cell (j, 2) of P is diminished by 1, and hence continues to be smaller than the entry z in cell (i, 2), which is unchanged. Also, at each step, entries in P above cell (i, 2) continue to be smaller than p. It follows that column 2 is always non-increasing.</p><p>Our argument is now complete.</p><p>To finish the proof thatV ? is indecomposable, we note first that Lemma 6.27 still holds, as does the following analogue of Lemma 6.17: Let P ? NSET(?) ? SIT(?), P = S 0 ? , and suppose there is a j such that j ? Des RS * (P ) \ Des RS * (S 0 ? ). Then a P = 0. In particular, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">f (S 0 ? ) = T ?NSET(?)?SIT * (?) a T T.</formula><p>Proof. The proof of Lemma 6.17 goes through verbatim.</p><p>It can now be verified that the argument following Lemma 6.27 carries through unchanged, thanks to Lemma 7.20. Combined with Lemma 7.15, this gives us the following:</p><p>Theorem 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">22</ref>. The H n (0)-moduleV ? is nonzero and indecomposable if ? has at least two parts greater than or equal to 2, and is zero otherwise. .</p><p>Next we observe that each of the quasisymmetric functions of this section is in fact the generating function for an appropriate class of tableaux. Recall (Definition 3.1) that RS * ? is the generating function for all tableaux of shape ? with weakly increasing first column, bottom to top, and strict increase along rows, left to right, while S * ? (Definition 2.2) is the generating function for all tableaux of shape ? with strictly increasing first column, bottom to top, and weak increase along rows, left to right.

In particular when ? is a partition ?, E ? = s ? .</p><p>Proof. Part (2) is immediate from Part (1) and the fact that RS * ? ? RE ? = RE ? . Part (3) is due to <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, where the authors define the shin basis ??? ? of NSym; their notation for our E ? is ??? * ? . Their proof arrives at our definition of column-strict semistandard immaculate tableaux using Pieri rules. However, one can also adapt the following proof of Part (1).</p><p>Our proof follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ex.</ref>  It suffices to show that for any ? n, the coefficient of the monomial x ? 1 1 x ? 2 2 ? ? ? in the righthand side is the number of row-strict semistandard immaculate tableaux of shape ? and content ?, i.e. with ? i i's. To see this, we recall <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> that for a composition ?, the monomial x ? 1 1 x ? 2 2 ? ? ? appears in F ? if and only if ? is a finer composition than ?, or equivalently, if and only if set(?) ? set(?). Hence the monomial x ? 1 1 x ? 2 2 ? ? ? appears in RE ? if and only if Des RS * (T ) ? set(?).</p><p>We claim that |{T ? SET(?) : Des RS * (T ) ? set(?)}| equals the number of row-strict semistandard immaculate tableaux of shape ? with ? i entries equal to i, for all i ? 1.</p><p>By definition, in a row-strict semistandard immaculate tableau ? , the entries 1, 2, . . . , i appear in the first i columns of ? from the left.</p><p>Fix a composition ? n. Given such a tableau ? with ? i i's, we associate to tau a tableau T ? SET(?) obtained by replacing the ? i entries equal to i with the ? i consecutive entries in the interval [? 1 + ? ? ? + ? i?1 , ? 1 + ? ? ? + ? i?1 + ? i ], where we read all the entries equal to i from bottom to top. Since the columns increase weakly and the rows increase strictly, no two i's are in the same row, so this implies that the descents in T can occur only where i's change to (i + 1)'s as we read up the columns of ? , starting with the leftmost column. Hence Des RS * (T ) ? set(?).</p><p>Conversely, suppose we have T ? SET(?) such that Des RS * (T ) ? set(?). To recover ? , replace 1, 2, . . . , ? 1 with 1's, ? 1 +1, . . . , ? 1 +? 2 with 2's and so on. The condition Des RS * (T ) ? set(?) guarantees that for all i, the first ? i entries appear in the first i columns of ? , and hence we have a tableau with weakly increasing columns, and strictly increasing rows. This finishes the proof.</p><p>In his paper, Searles shows that the set NSET(?) constitutes an H n (0)-invariant submodule of a larger parent module for the S * -action; he then shows that the resulting quotient module has the following properties: it has basis SET(?); it has quasiymmetric characteristic E ? , specialising to the Schur function s ? when ? is the partition ?; it is cyclically generated by the top element S row ?

Clearly the resulting quotient module has basis SET(?), characteristic E ? , and is cyclically generated by S row ? . It remains to check that this quotient module is indecomposable. But this follows by invoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.11]</ref>, which states that for P = S row ? there is an i such that ?

This ensures that the entries {1, 2, . . . , ?(?)} are preserved in the first column. Exactly as in the proof of Proposition 6.11, it follows that if T ?

Similarly, the proof of Lemma 8.3 shows that P can be obtained by applying a sequence of operators ? S * i to S row * ? , again without affecting the first column. It remains to check that the sequence of operators produces tableaux lying entirely within SET(?). But if the S * -straightening went from S row * ? to T and then T to P , where T / ? SET(?), then by reversing the arrows this would mean that, with respect to the RS * -action, T can be obtained by applying a sequence of RS * -operators to P .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">A new descent set</head><p>The work of this section is motivated by a desire to complete the analysis of 0-Hecke actions on the set SIT(?), by considering all the possible variations on the descent set definitions in Section 2. There are four possible relative positions of i and i + 1: (strictly/weakly) and (above/below), two of which give the dual immaculate and row-strict dual immaculate H n (0)-modules.</p><p>As in Section 4, for each composition ? of n, let V ? denote the vector space whose basis is the set SIT(?) of standard immaculate tableaux of shape ?. In this section we define two new descent sets which are complementary, and construct 0-Hecke modules for each one. This in turn gives two new families of quasisymmetric functions which are related by the involution ?. The general framework is tantalisingly similar to Section 4, but the details are sufficiently different that once again a careful analysis is required to ensure that one does indeed have a 0-Hecke action in each case. We will prove the following.  Here Des? * (T ) = {i : i + 1 is weakly above i in T }.</p><p>Note that, as is the case with S * ? and RS * ? , the two characteristics are related by the involution ? : ?(ch(? ? )) = ch(A ? ).</p><p>The H n (0)-actions we define in Theorem 9.10 and Theorem 9.13, will also establish the following.

For example, the three elements in SIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(13)</ref>  We turn now to constructing the appropriate H n (0)-modules for each new descent set. The standard model in the literature for doing this is the following. We are given some basis that is a subset ST (?), say, of the set of all standard tableaux of shape ?, and some definition of descents. For T ?

Then {i, i + 1} ? {j, j + 1} = ?, so the actions of ? i and ? j are independent of each other, and hence commute.

We now have i + 1 strictly below i in T, so that i + 1 is strictly above i in s i (T ), and i + 2 strictly below i + 1 in s i (T ). Also recall that i + 2 was weakly above i + 1 in T. It follows that (31)</p><p>In s i (T ), i + 2 is now weakly above i and strictly below i + 1.</p><p>This implies ? i+1 (s i (T )) = s i+1 (s i (T )), and in the latter we now have i (weakly) below i + 1, which is strictly below i + 2. In particular i is not a descent of ? i+1 (s i (T )) = s i+1 (s i (T )), and hence the latter tableau is fixed by ? i . Equation (30) is thus verified.</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">Case 3: Assume i / ? Des A * (T ), but i + 1 ?

Suppose i and i + 1 are NOT right-adjacent in T . Then i + 1 is strictly above both i and i + 2 in T, and thus i + 2 is strictly above both i, i + 1 in s i+1 (T ).

It is not clear how to approach the question of indecomposability for the module A ? . The method of Part (2) of Proposition 8.1 fails since the action of the generators is never 0 by definition.

Let ? n.</p><p>(1) Let T ? (1st col ?, rows ?) denote the set of tableaux of shape ? whose first column entries increase weakly bottom to top, and whose rows all increase weakly left to right. Then (2) Let T ? (1st col &lt;, rows &lt;) denote the set of tableaux of shape ? whose first column entries increase strictly bottom to top, and whose rows all increase strictly left to right. Then   Conversely let T ? S 1 . The entries of the standard tableau T constitute a labelling of the diagram of ?. We can then fill this diagram with ? 1 1's, ? 2 's, etc. consecutively following the order of the labels in T . If the cell labelled m is filled with entry i, then the cell labelled m + 1 can be filled with i or i + 1, but it must be filled with the label i + 1 if m is a descent of T . Such a filling is necessarily weakly row-increasing and also increasing in the first column.</p><p>In order to prove (2) we must show that, for a fixed ? n, the sets S 3 = {T ? SIT(?) : Des? * (T ) ? set(?)} and S 4 = {T ? T ? (1st col &lt;, rows &lt;) : T has shape ? and content ?} are of the same cardinality. The argument is similar, except for the change in reading order. Given U ? S 4 , note first that there is at most one i in each row, in view of the strict increase.</p><p>In particular, because of the strictly increasing first column, all entries equal to i go from left to right and top to bottom in U. Now we replace the 1's in U left to right, top to bottom, with the consecutive entries 1, . . . , ? 1 , then the 2's with the next ? 2 consecutive entries, again left to right, top to bottom, and so on. To go backwards from a standard tableau in S 3 to one with repeated entries, note that when i+1 is weakly above i, then i must be in set(?), so if i was replaced by an entry j, then i+1 must be replaced by j +1, guaranteeing row-strictness.</p><p>The reading order for (3) is the same as for <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>: left to right, bottom to top, and likewise, the reading order for (4) is the same as for <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>: left to right, top to bottom. We omit the details for the otherwise identical arguments. See also the proof of Proposition 7.24. Consider ch(A SET(?) ). Now F 5 will contribute all monomials with exponents ? 5, while F 32 will contribute only monomials with exponents ? finer than the composition 32. One such monomial that would appear in both expansions is x 1 x 2 2 x 2 3 , corresponding to the composition 122. There are exactly two tableaux of content 122 with weakly increasing rows and weakly increasing columns.</p><p>Following the reading order in the above proof, left to right, bottom to top, we see that . Note that these are weakly increasing in all rows and all columns. Hence T 1 comes from F 32 , and T 2 comes from F 5 . Now consider the module? ? . Here we have Des? * (S row ? ) = {1, 2, 3, 4}, Des? * (S col ? ) = {1, 2, 4}, and Des? * (S 0 ? ) = {1, 2, 3}, and hence ch(? SET(?) ) = F 1 5 + F 1121 , while ch(? ? ) = F 1 5 + F 1121 + F 1112 . . Note that T 3 is a non-standard tableau that is strictly increasing in all rows and all columns; also, it is the unique such tableau of content 1121.</p><p>Similarly F 1112 contributes the monomial x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 4 ; again following the reading order for? * , namely left to right and top to bottom, we see that S 0 ? = 3 4 2 5 1 maps to T 4 = 3 4 2 4 1</p><p>.</p><p>Note that T 4 is strictly increasing in all rows, but only strictly increasing in the first column.

Searles defines the descent set of a standard extended tableau T ? SET(?) as the set {i : i is weakly to the right of i + 1 in T}. This coincides with the descent set Des S * (T ) for dual immaculate tableaux as defined in Theorem 4.3, since it is easily verified, by an argument analogous to the proof of Lemma 7.2, that if T ?
