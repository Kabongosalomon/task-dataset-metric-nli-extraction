<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A critical part of reading is being able to understand the temporal relationships between events described in a passage of text, even when those relationships are not explicitly stated. However, current machine reading comprehension benchmarks have practically no questions that test temporal phenomena, so systems trained on these benchmarks have no capacity to answer questions such as "what happened before/after [some event]?" We introduce TORQUE, a new English reading comprehension benchmark built on 3.2k news snippets with 21k human-generated questions querying temporal relationships. Results show that RoBERTa-large achieves an exact-match score of 51% on the test set of TORQUE, about 30% behind human performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Time is important for understanding events and stories described in natural language text such as news articles, social media, financial reports, and electronic health records <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Verhagen et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Verhagen et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">UzZaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Minard et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bethard et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Laparra et al., 2018)</ref>. For instance, "he won the championship yesterday" is different from "he will win the championship tomorrow": he may be celebrating if he has already won it, while if he has not, he is probably still preparing for the game tomorrow.</p><p>The exact time of an event is often implicit in text. For instance, if we read that a woman is "expecting the birth of her first child", we know that the birth is in the future, while if she is "mourning the death of her mother", the death is in the past. These relationships between an event and a time point (e.g., "won the championship yesterday") or between two events (e.g., "expecting" is before "birth" and "mourning" is after "death") are called temporal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pustejovsky et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>This work studies reading comprehension for temporal relations, i.e., given a piece of text, a computer needs to answer temporal relation questions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>. Reading comprehension is a natural format for studying temporal phenomena, as the flexibility of natural language annotations allows for capturing relationships that were not possible in previous formalism-based works. However, temporal phenomena are studied very little in reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rajpurkar et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dua et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lin et al., 2019)</ref>, and existing systems are hence brittle when handling questions in TORQUE <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>Reading comprehension for temporal relationships has the following challenges. First, reading arXiv: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2005</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIME</head><p>We don't know if "snow" started before "rainfall" or if "disruption" started before "flooding."</p><p>Disruption/flooding may last longer than the snow/rainfall.</p><p>We know disruption/flooding started after snow/rainfall started, but we don't know if they started earlier than the landslide. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Timeline of the passage in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>  comprehension works rarely require event understanding. For the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, SQUAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref> and most datasets largely only require an understanding of predicates and arguments, and would ask questions like "what was a woman trapped in?" But a temporal relation question would be "what started before a woman was trapped?" To answer it, the system needs to identify events (e.g., LANDSLIDE is an event and "body" is not), the time of these events (e.g., <ref type="bibr">LANDSLIDE</ref> is a correct answer, while SAID is not because of the time when the two events happen), and look at the entire passage rather than the local predicate-argument structures within a sentence (e.g., SNOW and RAINFALL are correct answers to the question above). Second, there are many events in a typical passage of text, so temporal relation questions typically query more than one relationship at the same time. This means that a question can have multiple answers (e.g., "what happened after the landslide?"), or no answers, because the question may be beyond the time scope (e.g., "what happened before the snow started?").</p><p>Third, temporal relations queried by natural language questions are often sensitive to a few key words such as before, after, and start. Those questions can easily be changed to make contrasting questions with dramatically different answers. Models that are not sensitive to these small changes in question words will perform poorly on this task, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present TORQUE, the first reading comprehension benchmark that targets these challenges. We trained crowd workers to label events in text, and to write and answer questions that query temporal relationships between these events. We also had workers write questions with contrasting changes to the temporal keywords, to give a comprehensive test of a machine's temporal reasoning ability and minimize the effect of any data collection artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gardner et al., 2020)</ref>. We annotated 3.2k text snippets randomly selected from the TempEval3 dataset <ref type="bibr">(Uz-Zaman et al., 2013)</ref>. In total, TORQUE has 25k events and 21k user-generated and fully answered temporal relation questions. 20% of TORQUE was further validated by additional crowd workers to be used as test data. Results show that RoBERTalarge  achieves 51% in exactmatch on TORQUE after fine-tuning, about 30% behind human performance, indicating that more investigation is needed to better solve this problem.</p></div>

When studying time, events were defined as actions/states triggered by verbs, adjectives, and nominals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pustejovsky et al., 2003)</ref>. Later works on event and time have largely followed this definition, e.g., TempEval <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Verhagen et al., 2007)</ref>, TimeBank-Dense , <ref type="bibr">RED (O'Gorman et al., 2016)</ref>, and MATRES <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ning et al., 2018b)</ref>.</p><p>This work follows this line of event definition and uses event and event trigger interchangeably. We define an event to be either a verb or a noun (e.g., TRAPPED and LANDSLIDE in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Specifically, in copular constructions, we choose to label the verb as the event, instead of an adjective or preposition. This allows us to give a consistent treatment of "she was on the east coast yesterday" and "she was happy", which we can easily teach to crowd workers. Note that from the perspective of data collection, labeling the copula does not lose information as one can always do post-processing using dependency parsing or semantic role labeling to recover the connection between "was" and "happy."</p><p>Note that events expressed in text are not always factual. They can be negated, uncertain, hypothetical, or have other associated modalities (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). Prior work dealing with events often tried to categorize and label these various aspects because they were crucial for determining temporal relations. Sometimes certain categories were even dropped due to annotation difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pustejovsky et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">O'Gorman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ning et al., 2018b)</ref>. In this work, we simply have people label all events, irrespective of their modality, and use natural language to describe relations between them, as discussed in Sec. 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Temporal Relations</head><p>Temporal relations describe the relationship between two events with respect to time, or between one event and a fixed time point (e.g., yesterday). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We can use a triplet, (A, r, B), to represent this relationship, where A and B are events or time points, and r is a temporal relation. For example, the first sentence in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> expresses a temporal relation (HAD, happened before, SLEPT). In previous works, every event is assumed to be associated with a time interval [t start , t end ]. When comparing two events, there are 13 possible relation labels (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen, 1984)</ref>. However, there are still many relations that cannot be expressed because the assumption that every event has a time interval is inaccurate: The time scope of an event may be fuzzy, an event can have a nonfactual modality, or events can be repetitive and invoke multiple intervals (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). To better handle these phenomena, we move away from the fixed set of relations used in prior work and instead use natural language to annotate the relationships between events, as described in the next section.</p></div>

Recalling that we denote a temporal relation between two events as (A, r, B), we use (?, r, B) to denote a temporal relation question. We instantiate these temporal relation questions using natural language. For instance, (?, happened before, <ref type="bibr">SLEPT)</ref> means "what happened before a lion slept?" We then expect as an answer the set of all events A in the passage such that (A, r, B) holds, assuming for any deictic expression A or B the time point when the passage was written, and assuming that the passage is true.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fuzzy relations</head><p>Heavy snow is causing disruption to transport across the UK, with heavy rainfall bringing flooding to the south-west of England.</p><p>Q: What happens at about the same time as the disruption? A: flooding Q: What started after the snow started?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Advantages</head><p>Studying temporal relations as a reading comprehension task gives us the flexibility to handle many of the aforementioned difficulties. First, fuzzy relations can be described by natural language questions (after all, the relations are expressed in natural language in the first place). In <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, DIS-RUPTION and FLOODING happened at about the same time, but we do not know for sure which one is earlier, so we have to choose vague. Similarly for SNOW and DISRUPTION, we do not know which one ends earlier and have to choose vague again. In contrast, the question-answer (QA) pairs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questions that query events in different modes</head><p>[Negated] What didn't the lion do after a large meal?</p><p>[Uncertain] What might the lion do before sleeping?</p><p>[Hypothetical] What will the lion do if it has a large meal?</p><p>[Repetitive] What did the lion use to do after large meals?</p><p>[Generic] What do lions do after a large meal? <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Events in different modes can be distinguished using natural language questions. "Often before" vs "before"</p><p>He used to take a walk after dinner.  in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> can naturally capture these fuzzy relations.</p><p>Second, natural language questions can conveniently incorporate different modes of events. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows how to accurately query the relation between "having a meal" and "sleeping" in different modes (original sentences can be found in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). In contrast, if we could only choose one label, we must choose before for all these relations, although these relations are actually different. For instance, a repetitive event may be a series of intervals rather than a single one, and often before is very different from before <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 8</ref>).</p><p>Third, a major issue that prior works wanted to address was deciding when two events should have a relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mostafazadeh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">O'Gorman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ning et al., 2018b)</ref>. To avoid asking for relations that do not exist, prior works needed to explicitly annotate certain properties of events as a preprocessing step, but it still remains difficult to have a the-When should two events have a relation?</p><p>Service industries showed solid job gains, an area expected to be hardest hit when the crisis hit the America economy.</p><p>Some pairs have relations: (showed gains), (expected hit), (gains crisis), etc. Some don't: (showed hit), (gains hit)</p><p>A passerby called the police to report the body, but the line was busy.</p><p>Some pairs have relations: (called report), (called was) Some don't: (report was) ory explaining, for instance, why hit can compare to expected and crisis, but not to gains. Interestingly, when we annotate temporal relations in natural language, the annotator naturally avoids event pairs that do not have relations. For instance, for the sentences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 9</ref>, one will not ask questions like "what happened after the service industries are hardest hit?" or "what happened after a passerby reported the body?" Instead, natural questions will be "what was expected to happen when the crisis hit America?" and "what was supposed to happen after a passerby called the police?" The format of natural language questions bypasses the need for explicit annotation of properties of events or other theories.</p><p>While using QA as the format gives us many benefits in describing fuzzy relations and incorporating various temporal phenomena, we want to note that it may also lead to potential difficulties in transferring the knowledge to downstream tasks that are not in a QA format, and some special treatment in modeling may be needed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">He et al. (2020)</ref>). This paper focuses on constructing this QA dataset covering new phenomena, and the problem of successful transfer learning is beyond our scope here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Penalize Shortcuts by Contrast Sets</head><p>An important problem in building datasets is to avoid trivial solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gardner et al., 2019a)</ref>. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> shows, there are two events ATE and WENT in the text. Since ATE is already mentioned in the question, the answer of WENT seems a trivial option without the need to understand the underlying relationship. To address this issue, we create contrast questions which slightly modify the original questions, but dramatically change the an-  swers, so that shortcuts are penalized. Specifically, for an existing question (?, r, B) (e.g., "what happened after he ate his breakfast?"), one should keep using B and change r (e.g., "what happened before/shortly after/... he ate his breakfast?"), or modify it to ask about the start/end time (e.g., "what happened after he started eating his breakfast?" or "what would finish after he ate his breakfast?"). We also instructed workers to make sure that the answers to the new question are different from the original one to avoid trivial modifications (e.g., changing "what happened" to "what occurred").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data Collection</head><p>We used Amazon Mechanical Turk to build TORQUE. Following prior work, we focus on passages that consist of two contiguous sentences, as this is sufficient to capture the vast majority of non-trivial temporal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ning et al., 2017)</ref>. We took all the articles used in the TempEval3 (TE3) workshop (2.8k articles) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref> and created a pool of 26k two-sentence passages. Given a random passage from this pool, the annotation process for crowd workers was:</p><p>1. Label all the events 2. Repeatedly do the following 3 (a) Ask a temporal relation question and point out all the answers from the list of events (b) Modify the temporal relation to create one or more new questions and answer them</p><p>The annotation guidelines 4 and interface 5 are public. In the following sections, we further discuss issues of quality control and crowdsourcing cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Quality Control</head><p>We used three quality control strategies: qualification, pilot, and validation. Qualification We designed a separate qualification task where crowd workers were trained and tested on 3 capabilities: labeling events, asking temporal relation questions, and questionanswering. They were tested on problems randomly selected from a pool we designed. Crowd workers were considered level-1 qualified if they could pass the test within 3 attempts. In practice, about 1 out of 3 workers passed our qualification.</p><p>Pilot We then asked level-1 crowd workers to do a small amount of the real task. We manually checked the annotations and gave feedback to them. Those who passed this inspection were called level-2 workers, and only they could work on the large-scale real task. Roughly 1 out of 3 pilot submissions received a level-2 qualification. In the end, there were 63 level-2 annotators, and 60 of them actually worked on our large-scale task.</p><p>Validation We randomly selected 20% of the articles from TORQUE for further validation. We first validated the events by 4 different level-2 annotators (with the original annotator, there were in total 5 different humans). We also intentionally added noise to the original event list so that the validators must carefully identify wrong events. The final event list was determined by aggregating all 5 humans using majority vote. Second, we validated the answers in the same portion of the data. Two level-2 workers were asked to verify the initial annotator's answers; we again added noise to the answer list as a quality control for the validators. Instead of using majority vote as we did for events, the final answers from all workers are considered correct. We did not do additional validation for the questions themselves, as a manual inspection found the quality to be very high already, with no bad questions in a random sample of 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Cost</head><p>In each job of the main task, we presented 3 passages. The crowd worker could decide to use some or all of them. For each passage a worker decided to use, they needed to label the events, answer 3 hard-coded warm-up questions, and then ask and answer at least 12 questions (including contrast questions). The final reward is a base pay of $6 plus $0.5 for each extra question. Crowd workers thus had the incentive to (1) use fewer passages so that they can do event labeling and warm-up questions fewer times, (2) modify questions instead of asking from scratch, and (3) ask extra questions in each job. All these incentives were for more coverage of the temporal phenomena in each passage. In practice, crowd workers on average used 2 passages in each job. Validating the events in each passage and the answers to a specific question both cost $0.1. In total, TORQUE cost $15k for an average of $0.70/question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">TORQUE Statistics</head><p>TORQUE has 3.2k passage annotations (?50 tokens/passage), 6 24.9k events (7.9 events/passage), and 21.2k user-provided questions (half of them were labeled by crowd workers as modifications of existing ones). Every passage comes with 3 hardcoded warm-up questions asking which events in the passage had already happened, were ongoing, or were still in the future. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref> shows some basic statistics of TORQUE. Note the 3 warm-up questions form a contrast set, and we treat the first as "original" and the others "modified."</p><p>In a random sample of 200 questions in the test set of TORQUE, we found 94 questions querying about relations that cannot be directly represented by the previous single-interval-based labels. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 2</ref> gives example questions capturing these phenomena. More analysis of the event, answer, and workload distributions are in Appendix A-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Quality</head><p>To validate the event annotations, we took the events provided by the initial annotator, added noise, and asked different workers to validate. We also trained an auxiliary event detection model using RoBERTa-large and added its predictions as event candidates. This tells us about the quality of events in TORQUE in two ways. First, the Worker Agreement with Aggregate (WAWA) F 1 here is 94.2%; that is, compare the majority-vote with all annotators, and perform micro-average on all instances. Second, if an event candidate is labeled by both the initial annotator and the model, then almost all of them (99.4%) are kept by the validators; if neither the initial annotator nor the model labeled a candidate, the candidate is almost surely removed (0.8%). As validators did not know which ones were noise or not before-   hand, this indicates that the validators could identify noise terms reliably. Similarly, the WAWA F 1 of the answer annotations is 84.7%, slightly lower than that for events, which is expected because temporal relation QA is intuitively harder. Results show that 12.3% of the randomly added answer candidates were labeled as correct answers by the validators. We manually inspected 100 questions and found 11.6% of the added noise terms were correct answers (very close to 12.3%), indicating that the validators were actually doing a good job in answer validation. More details of the metrics and the quality of annotations can be found in Appendix E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiment</head><p>We split TORQUE into train (80% of all the questions), dev (5%), and test (15%) and these three parts do not have the same articles. To solve TORQUE in an end-to-end fashion, the model here takes as input a passage and a question, then looks at every token in the passage and makes a binary classification of whether this token is an answer to the question or not. Specifically, the model has a one-layered perceptron on top of BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> or RoBERTa , and the input to the perceptron layer is the transformers' output corresponding to the token we're looking at. We fine-tuned BERT/RoBERTa (both "base" and "large") on the training set of TORQUE. We fixed batch size = 6 (each instance is a tuple of one passage, one question, and all its answers) with gradient accumulation step = 2 in all experiments. We selected the learning rate (from (1e ?5 , 2e ?5 )), the training epoch (within 10), and the random seed (from 3 arbitrary ones) based on performance on the dev set of TORQUE. 7 To compute an estimate of human performance, one author answered 100 questions from the test set and compared with crowd workers' annotations.</p><p>Both the human performance and system performances are shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. We report the standard macro F 1 and exact-match (EM) metrics in question answering, and also EM consistency, the percentage of contrast question sets for which a model's predictions match exactly to all questions in a group <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gardner et al., 2020)</ref>. We see warm-up questions are easier than user-provided ones because warm-up questions focus on easier phenomena of past/ongoing/future events. In addition, RoBERTa-large is expectedly the best system, but still far behind human performance, trailing by about 30% in EM.</p><p>We further downsampled the training data to test the performance of RoBERTa. We find that with 10% of the original training data, RoBERTa fails to learn anything meaningful and simply pre-  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Human/system performance on the test set of TORQUE.

With 50% of the training data, RoBERTa is slightly lower than but already comparable to that of using the entire training set. This means that the learning curve on TORQUE is already flat and the current size of TORQUE may not be the bottleneck for its low performance. Our data and code are public to facilitate more investigations into TORQUE. 8</p></div>

The approach that prior works took to handle the aforementioned temporal phenemona was to define formalisms such as the different modes of events <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>, a predefined label set ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>, different time axes for events <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ning et al., 2018b)</ref>, and specific rules to follow when there is confusion. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bethard et al. (2007)</ref> QA as annotation. A natural choice is then to cast temporal relation understanding as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem. TORQUE is motivated by the philosophy in QA-SRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(He et al., 2015)</ref> and QAMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Michael et al., 2017)</ref>, where QA pairs were used as representations for predicate-argument structures. In zeroshot relation extraction (RE), they reduced relation slot filling to an MRC problem so as to build very large distant training data and improve zero-shot learning performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Levy et al., 2017)</ref>. However, our work differs from zero-shot RE since it centers around entities, while TORQUE is about events; the way to ask and answer questions, and the way to design a corresponding crowdsourcing pipeline, are thus significantly different between us.</p><p>The QA-TempEval workshop <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Llorens et al., 2015)</ref>, desipte its name, is actually not studying temporal relations in an RC setting. The differences between TORQUE and QA-TempEval are as follows.</p><p>First, QA TempEval is an evaluation approach for systems that generate TimeML annotations and actually is not a QA task. For instance, QA TempEval is to evaluate whether a system can answer questions like "IS &lt;ENTITY 1&gt; &lt;RELATION&gt; &lt;ENTITY 2&gt;?", where one clearly knows which event that &lt;ENTITY&gt; is referring to and where RELATION is selected from a predefined label set. Second, QA-TempEval's annotation relies on the existence of a TimeML corpus. From the perspective of data collection for studying a particular phenomenon, TORQUE has done more on defining the task and developing a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. As a result, TORQUE is also much larger than QA-TempEval and the annotation pipeline of TORQUE can be easily adopted to collect even more data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>Understanding temporal ordering of events is critical in reading comprehension, but existing works have studied very little about it. This paper presents TORQUE, a new English machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset of temporal ordering questions. TORQUE has 3.2k news snippets, 9.5k hard-coded questions asking which events had happened, were ongoing, or were still in the future, and 21.2k human-generated questions querying more complex phenomena. We argue that an MRC setting allows for more convenient representation of these temporal phenomena than conventional formalisms. Results show that even a state-of-the-art language model, RoBERTa-large, falls behind human performance by a large margin, necessitating more investigation on improving MRC on temporal relationships in the future.</p><p>As we mentioned in Sec. 5, TORQUE has 24.9k events over 3.2k passages. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the histogram of the number of events in all these passages. We can see it roughly follows a Gaussian distribution with the mean at around 7-8 events per passage.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> further shows the 50 most common events in TORQUE. Unsurprisingly, the most common events are reporting verbs (e.g., "say", "tell", "report", and "announce") and copular verbs. Other common events such as "meeting", "killed", "visit", and "war" are also expected given that the passages of TORQUE were taken from news articles. #Appearances in TORQUE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>: Fifty most common event triggers in TORQUE. Note the y-axis is in log scale. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows a sunburst visualization of the questions provided by crowd workers in TORQUE, including both their original questions and their modifications. Specifically, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14a</ref> shows that almost all of the questions start with "what." The small portion of questions that do not start with "what" are cases where crowd workers switch the order of how they ask. One example of these was "Before making his statement to the Sunday Mirror, what did the author do?" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14a</ref> also shows the most common following words of "what."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Question Prefix Distribution</head><p>Figures 14b-c further show the distribution of questions starting with "what happened" and "what will." We can see that when asking things in the past, people ask more about "what happened before/after" than "what happened while/during," while when asking things in the future, people ask much more about "what will happen after" than "what will happen before."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What happened</head><p>What will Overall </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Answer Distribution</head><p>The distribution of the number of answers to each question is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref>, where we divide the questions into 4 categories: the original warm-up questions, the modified warm-up questions, the original user questions, and the modified user questions. Note for each passage, there are 3 warm-up questions and they were all hard-coded when crowd workers worked on them. We are treating the first one (i.e., "What events have already finished?") as the original and the other two as modified (i.e., "What events have begun but have not finished?" and "What will happen in the future?"). We can see that in both the warm-up and the user questions, "modified" has a larger portion of questions with no answers at all as compared to the "original." This effect is very significant for warm-up questions because in news articles, most of the events were in the past. As for the user-provided questions, the percentage of no-answer questions is higher in "modified," but it is not as drastic as for the warm-up question. This because we only required that the modified question should have different answers from the original one; many of those questions sill have answers after modification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Workload Distribution Among Workers</head><p>As each annotator may be biased to only ask questions in a certain way, it is important to make sure that the entire dataset is not labeled by only a few annotators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Geva et al. (2019)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16a</ref> shows the contribution of each crowd worker to TORQUE and we can see even the rightmost worker only provided 5%. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16b</ref> further adopts the notion of Gini Index to show the dispersion. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The Gini index of TORQUE is 0.42.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S 1 S 2 (a) (b)</formula><p>Gini Index=S 1 /(S 1 +S 2 )=0.42 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>: If every annotator provided the same number of passages (i.e., perfect equality), the curve would be the straight dashed line and the Gini Index would be 0. If one person provided all the annotations, the Gini Index is 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E Worker Agreement With Aggregate</head><p>In Sec. 5 we described the worker agreement with aggregate (WAWA) metric for measuring the interannotator agreement (IAA) between crowd workers of TORQUE. This WAWA metric is explained in the figure below. It is to first get an aggregated answer set from multiple workers (we used majority vote as the aggregate function), then compare each worker with the aggregated answer set, and finally compute the micro-average across multiple workers and multiple questions. Tables 5 and 6 show the quality of event annotations and question-answering annotations, respectively. In both of them, the IAA are using the WAWA metric explained above; the "Init Annotator" rows are a slight modification of WAWA, which means that all workers are used when aggregating those answers, 9 A high Gini Index here means the data were provided by a small group of workers. The Gini Index of family incomes in the United States was 0.49 in 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Semega et al., 2019).</ref> but only the first annotator is compared against the aggregated answer set.   </p></div>
