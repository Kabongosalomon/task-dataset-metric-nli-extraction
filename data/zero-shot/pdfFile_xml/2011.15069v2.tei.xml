<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Graph learning encompass a wide and particularly diverse set of problems. A recent surge of interest in the deep learning community and the publication of many graph datasets already lead to many successful applications, opening the way to exciting new perspectives. Graphs can naturally model the data involved in many applications, such as visual reasoning or semantic segmentation, community detection and social network predictions, recommender systems, traffic predictions, and much more <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Zhou et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wu et al., 2020)</ref>. Among those problems, supervised whole graph property prediction is an important topic, essentially applied to molecular property prediction, which will be the center of interest of this work. Data-based approaches, as opposed to more traditional simulation-based methods, present a great potential as the required time for a prediction could be reduced by many orders of magnitude while increasing the predictive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gilmer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fey et al., 2020)</ref>. Graph neural networks have been proven to be particularly effective in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wu et al., 2018)</ref>, exceeding other approaches, both based on other data representations or on manual feature engineering. Note that the computation time is as important an issue as the performance, as modern pipelines in pharmaceutical research often rely on scanning tens of thousands of candidate molecules in silico, before selecting only a handful for experimental tests.</p><p>Beside these promising perspectives, molecular property prediction still presents many difficulties. A first one is owed to the cost of producing experimental measurements of biochemical properties of compounds. Thus, despite the recent revolution of high throughput screening, public datasets are often rather small. Either they contain only a few thousands or even hundreds of molecules, or they are heavily multi-tasked and scarcely labelled, so that even apparently large datasets can contain only a few handful of positively labelled molecules. Thus, overfitting is a major problem in the context of molecule property prediction.</p><p>A second problem is that the most common framework, namely message passing neural network (MPNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Xu et al., 2019)</ref>, is not an universal approximator of functions on graphs. More precisely, it is equivalent to the first order Weisfeiler Leman kernel (1-WL). Although such network could in principle have a strong discriminative power with enough layers, it was shown that practical networks can have trouble solving even basic structure related tasks, such as detecting small cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Loukas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. This seems like a serious problem, as biochemistry is mainly based on the analysis of local graph structures, such as aromatic groups. Multiple attempts to solve this apparent lack of expressiveness have been proposed. A first approach is to develop methods to train larger and deeper networks , which can already lead to a considerable boost in performance. A few works are fundamentally diverging from the standard convolution based framework, such as invariant graph networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Maron et al., 2019;</ref> or relational pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Murphy et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. Despite being provably more powerful, the amount of calculation required by these methods is still prohibitively large, and they usually do not outperform more traditional methods. Another approach is to extend the current framework, to make it equivalent to higher order Weisfeiler Leman kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Morris et al., 2019)</ref>, or to increase the receptive field of each convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Flam-Shepherd et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nikolentzos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-El-Haija et al., 2019)</ref>. However, these approaches make considerable changes to the architecture of the network and require much more parameters than the basic approach. Finally, based on the observation that the arXiv:2011.15069v2 <ref type="bibr">[cs.</ref>LG] 3 Jun 2021 issue arises from the presence of cycles in the input graph, it was proposed to perform coupled convolution on both the input graph and a coarser version of it from which all cycles have been removed . Despite interesting results, this approach gives more information to the network and considerably changes the architecture.</p><p>In this work, we propose an alternative method to tackle this issue in the simplest possible fashion. We argue that increasing the effective receptive field of each convolution step should be enough to solve the problem when only small cycles are involved, which is mostly the case in the context of chemistry. However, the global receptive field should not be increased, as the additional information could be ill-used. We propose a variant of the standard GIN convolution to do so with a minimal cost in term of computation time and number of parameters. We show that this approach boosts performance on larger datasets. In particular, at the time this article is written, our model ranks first on the Open Graph Database leaderboard for the PCBA dataset, which is one of the largest benchmark for molecular bio-activity prediction. More generally, our results on several standard datasets show that our method is well adapted to multitasked settings, increasing the performance both on average and on isolated tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Graph neural network</head><p>In graph classification or regression tasks, a network operates on a labelled graph G(V, E) where V = 1..N is the set of nodes and E ? V ? V is the set of undirected edges, x v ? R dn is the label of the node v ? V and e ij ? R de is the label of the edge (i, j) ? E.</p><p>A very general framework to perform graph representation learning is message passing neural network (MPNN). The network consists in L message passing layers, also called graph convolutions, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m (l) ij = M ESSAGE h (l?1) i , h (l?1) j , e ij a (l) i = AGGREGAT E m (l) ij j?N1(i) h (l) i = U P DAT E h (l?1) i , a (l) i (1) where h (l)</formula><p>i is the embedding of the node i after the l-th layer. MESSAGE and UPDATE are learned functions. The AGGREGATE function acts on a multiset, i.e. a set with repetitions, defined by the neighbours of a node i, N 1 (i) = {j/(i, j) ? E}. This function has to accept multiple sizes of set and has to be node permutation invariant so that the network does not predict a different result when the node indexing is changed. In most cases, sum, mean or max operator is used. We set h (0) i = x i . After L message passing layers, the resulting node embeddings h (L) i are then globally pooled to produce a fixed size vector representation, usually using once again a sum, mean or max operator. The resulting representation lies in R n and is then used as input for downstream tasks.</p><p>Each layer should be able to aggregate the multiset of its neighbours in each node without loosing information. Thus, in order to discriminate different graphs, a requirement is that the operation is injective on multisets, or at least on a large finite ensemble of multisets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Xu et al., 2019)</ref> have proposed graph isomorphism network(GIN), an efficient implementation of message passing that enables this property, making it one of the most expressive convolution. In order to add edge information in the convolution, GINE a slight variant of GIN has been proposed by  :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">GINE :a (l) i = j?N1(i) ? h (l?1) j + E(e ij ) h (l) i = M LP (1 + )h (l?1) i + a (l) i (2)</formula><p>where M LP is a standard multi-layer perceptron, is a learned parameter, ? is a nonlinearity such as ReLU and E(e ij ) is an embedding of the label of the edge (i, j).</p><p>In addition to convolutions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al., 2017)</ref> proposed the introduction of a virtual node, initially in order to allow the network to grasp long range dependencies between the nodes. A new node, so-called the virtual node, is added to the graph and connected to every other node. The same convolutions are applied on this node, although with specific weights, so that information about the whole graph can be used at every step. Thus if the main convolution operator is GIN, the virtual node aggregation step is written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Virtual Node :H (l) = M LP ((1 + )H (l?1) + i?V h (l) j ) h (l) i = h (l) i + H (l)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where H is the embedding of the virtual node and h refers to the node embedding before the virtual node step.</p><p>The structure of such network is summed up in figure 1 where we added nonlinear activations and standard regularisation layers. Hyperparameters and details for the different studied tasks can be found in appendix.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. General structure of the network used in this work. Note that the Virtual node blocks are optional. Also note that the nonlinearity is usually omitted in the last Conv Block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Increasing the kernel size for small cycle detection</head><p>Without virtual node, convolution based networks are at most as discriminative as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Loukas, 2019)</ref>. More practically, this means that the information contained in the embedding of a node at layer l can represent at best a breadth first search (BFS) tree of depth l with repetition, rooted at this node. Importantly, the nodes are anonymous, so the repeated nodes between different layers are embedded as different ones. Hence, if cycles are present in the input graph, it is always possible to propose a different graph with the same embedding for a given node, as the example in figure 2 illustrates. As a result, cycle detection from the embedding of a node is fundamentally impossible. Thus, as there is no local information about the real structure of the graph, it can only be inferred after a global aggregation step where the BFS trees from each node must be assembled together. This step can become very complex or impossible as the graph size augments, partly due to the fact that global pooling is performed with very simple functions, such as sum or mean.</p><p>In order to circumvent this problem, there are three routes. First, one could propose more complex aggregation methods, e.g. adding attention or using more complex set invariant functions. Second, one could perform the global aggregation at multiple levels of granularity to ease the task. This ultimately leads to the virtual node update. Finally, one can design a new type of convolution with a better ability to detect cycles.</p><p>Because we believe that a method relying on global aggregation cannot be scalable, we focus on the third solution. We propose to increase the receptive field of each convolution layer, in the simplest possible fashion. Slightly modifying the original GINE convolution, each node aggregates a wider neighbourhood, encompassing cycles if there are some. This plays a role which is the local equivalent of the global pooling layer. Hence, any cycle smaller than twice the radius of such convolution can be detected. A na?ve implementation of this idea is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">NaiveGINE+ :a (l,0) i = h (l?1) i a (l,1) i = j?N1(i) ?(h (l?1) j + E(e ij ) a (l,k) i = j?N k (i) ?(h (l?1) j ) h (l) i = M LP K k=0 (1 + k )a (l,k) i<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Where K is the convolution radius and N k (i) is the set of all nodes at distance k of i. can be either a scalar, as in standard GIN, or a vector itself. We found it made almost no difference and used vector epsilon in this work. With K = 1, this convolution is almost equivalent to GINE.</p><p>In principle, this formulation can enable the network to detect structures more efficiently at the local level. However, after L convolutions, the receptive field of a node is K ? L so that each node has access to much more information than Standard convolution (layer l=2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GIN+ (layer l=2)</head><p>Input graphs <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Illustration of the standard and the GINE+ convolutions on two different example inputs, shown in the top part of the figure. The first line in each case corresponds to the information received by the node with index 0 during the second convolution, with radius 2 in the case of GINE+. The second line corresponds to possible neighbourhood of node 0 given the information it will contain after this second convolution. The distance between the node transmitting the information and node 0 is recalled below. We can observe that the information obtained via standard convolution is not enough to infer a unique neighbourhood. Adding more convolution layers would actually not help in that case (see appendix). Note that node 0 does not have access to information from a distance greater than 2 in this example.</p><p>with standard convolution. This could be detrimental, as this information could be ill-used to build specific discriminative features, leading to overfitting instead of more meaningful ones.</p><p>Aiming at allowing local structural reasoning without adding unnecessary information, we alter the previous formulation as follows :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">GINE+ :a (l,0) i = h (l?1) i a (l,1) i = j?N1(i) ?(h (l?1) j + E(e ij ) a (l,k) i = j?N k (i) ?(h (l?k) j ) h (l) i = M LP K k=0 (1 + k )a (l,k) i<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The only difference resides in the definition of a (l,k) i , which now takes its input in the layer l ? k instead of l ? 1. As a result, at layer l, a node will receive information from another at distance k, which has information about other nodes at distance at most l ? k from itself. Thus, the receptive distance at layer l is still only l. Note that this amounts to signaling only redundancies at each depth of the BFS. The behaviour of GINE+ is illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Notice that the new form of this convolution requires only a handful of additional parameters. Indeed, the only additions are the vector k , which contain a small number of parameters compared to the matrices in the convolution. Moreover, most of the calculations have been performed in previous layers, so that only a few supplementary additions must be executed compared to GINE. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Main characteristics of the datasets used in this study. The first column is the total number of compounds in the dataset. The second is the number of independent classification tasks. The third is the average size of molecules in the dataset. The fourth is the proportion of data labelled as missing. The fifth is the amount of positive classes among all non missing data. The sixth is the total number of positive classes in the dataset and the last is the total number of molecules which are positive in at least one task in the dataset. </p></div>

The GCN convolution can be seen as a computationally simple first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bruna et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Defferrard et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While GCN is able to learn graph representations encoding structure and node features, some drawbacks have been pointed by followup works.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substructure detection</head><p>Even with the increased expressiveness of GIN and GINE graph convolution, its inability to properly detect graph cycles remains a major limitation, in particular when dealing with molecular graphs such as found in organic chemistry. This problem has been investigated by many recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nikolentzos et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-El-Haija et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Loukas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fey et al., 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Dataset</head><p>We performed experiments on five molecule classification datasets, from MoleculeNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Wu et al., 2018)</ref> and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)  collections, which cover a wide range of tasks:</p><p>? MUV is a dataset designed from PubChem bioactivity data specially designed for virtual screening methods benchmark.</p><p>? Tox21 and ToxCast contain molecules assayed against diverse toxicity-related targets, based on in vitro highthroughput screening.</p><p>? HIV is a single classification task dataset corresponding to the experimentally measured ability of a compound to inhibit the HIV virus replication.</p><p>? PCBA is a subset of PubChem BioAssay consisting of measured bio-activities of compounds.  The characteristics of all datasets are summed up in table 1. We noted that, despite sometimes deceptively large sizes, molecule datasets are extremely skewed. In particular, most datasets contain only a few thousand molecules of interest, in the sense that they are positively classified in at least one task. These datasets can be overfitted easily: if those few molecules are memorized, the network only has to be able to differentiate distinct molecules. This is a task for which graph neural networks are particularly well fitted. PCBA is the only dataset that does not suffer from this lack of positive samples: Being both large and heavily multi-tasked, it contains nearly two orders of magnitude more molecules of interest.</p><p>Different kind of splitting methods are typically used. Random splitting is simple, but can produce misleading results as there are a lot of small variations of the same sample in most molecule datasets. Scaffold splitting, where samples are separated in based on their general structure, is often used to perform experiments closer to the reality. In this work, we use the scaffold split provided with the Open Graph Benchmark framework for the MUV, HIV and PCBA datasets and random split for the Tox21 and ToxCast datasets.</p><p>For comparability with litterature, we use PRC-AUC as the metric for the two most skewed datasets, MUV and PCBA, while we use ROC-AUC on the others.</p><p>Finally, we augment the smallest datasets with PCBA, making them a supplementary task of the larger PCBA dataset. This is done to prevent overfitting by increasing the number of samples. Validation and test are still performed only on the smaller sets. These datasets are used to study the performance on only one task in a multitasked setting.</p></div>

Details about the architecture and hyperparameters are given in annex.</p><p>All experiments are run five times on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU before measuring their average performance and standard deviation. The longest experiments are those on the PCBA dataset or datasets augmented by PCBA, which take approximately 6 hours.</p><p>The code is available online, the URL will be announced after the anonymous review process is finished.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Results</head><p>First, we evaluate the performance of our model against baselines on all datasets. The results are displayed in table 2. Our model ranks first on the large PCBA dataset, by a clear margin, making it the leading model for PCBA in the OGB leaderboard when this paper was written. However, on the four smaller datasets, the model does not outperform stateof-the-art models. In particular, it performs slightly lower than GINE with virtual node, which shares most similarities with our model. We believe this is due to the fact that the smaller datasets are easier to overfit, so that the addition in expressive power in our model was ill-used to memorize the dataset instead of learning useful structural features.</p><p>In order to limit the ability of the model to overfit, we evaluate the performance of our model on small datasets combined with PCBA. As detailed in section 5.1, the training is performed on the training data of both datasets, but evaluation is performed only on the validation set of the nonaugmented dataset. Obviously, we observe a performance boost over the training on the non-augmented datasets. Nonetheless, our model performs better on all augmented datasets compared to GINE.</p><p>Finally, we note that these improvements come at a very small price: in our experiments, the calculation time increased by 3 to 15 % while the increment in number of parameters is only a few fractions of percent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed GINE+ which builds on the idea of the standard GIN convolution by increasing the radius of the convolution in a non-naive way. Without increasing the perceptive field, which could lead to undesirable effects, such as overfitting, GINE+ produce node embeddings that are more informative about its local neighbourhood. In particular, it can efficiently learn to detect small cycles. GINE+ comes at a small cost in term of computation time and a negligible one in term of number of parameters.</p><p>We apply our method to molecular property prediction. Our model consistently improves performance on large datasets, and seems to produce useful features that transfer efficiently in a multitask setting. In particular, our model ranks first on the PCBA dataset when this article is written.</p><p>Beside this result, we believe that the ability to infer a node neighbourhood from its embedding is essential in numerous graph problems, in particular in the case of graph pooling and graph generation. We leave these development to future works.</p></div>
