<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hierarchical relations are prevalent and indispensable for organizing human knowledge captured by a knowledge graph (KG). The key property of hierarchical relations is that they induce a partial ordering over the entities, which needs to be modeled in order to allow for hierarchical reasoning. However, current KG embeddings can model only a single global hierarchy (single global partial ordering) and fail to model multiple heterogeneous hierarchies that exist in a single KG. Here we present ConE (Cone Embedding), a KG embedding model that is able to simultaneously model multiple hierarchical as well as non-hierarchical relations in a knowledge graph. ConE embeds entities into hyperbolic cones and models relations as transformations between the cones. In particular, ConE uses cone containment constraints in different subspaces of the hyperbolic embedding space to capture multiple heterogeneous hierarchies. Experiments on standard knowledge graph benchmarks show that ConE obtains state-of-the-art performance on hierarchical reasoning tasks as well as knowledge graph completion task on hierarchical graphs. In particular, our approach yields new state-of-the-art Hits@1 of 45.3% on WN18RR and 16.1% on DDB14 (0.231 MRR). As for hierarchical reasoning task, our approach outperforms previous best results by an average of 20% across the three datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Knowledge graph (KG) is a data structure that stores factual knowledge in the form of triplets, which connect two entities (nodes) with a relation (edge) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Knowledge graphs play an important role in many scientific and machine learning applications, including question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and discovery in biomedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Knowledge graph completion is the problem of predicting missing relations in the graph, and is crucial in many real-world applications. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> approach the task by embedding entities and relations into low-dimensional vector space and then use the embeddings to learn a function that given a head entity h and a relation r predicts the tail entity t.</p><p>Hierarchical information is ubiquitous in real-world KGs, such as WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or Gene Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, since much human knowledge is organized hierarchically. KGs can be composed of a mixture of non-hierarchical (e.g., likes, friendOf ) and hierarchical (e.g., isA, partOf ), where non-hierarchical  relations capture interactions between the entities at the same level while hierarchical relations induce a tree-like partial ordering structure of entities.</p><p>While non-hierarchical relations have been successfully modeled in the past, there has been a recent focus on modeling hierarchical relations. Recent works in this area propose the use of a variety of embedding geometries such as hyperbolic embeddings, box embeddings, and cone embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> to model partial ordering property of hierarchical relations, but two important challenges remain: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Existing works that consider hierarchical relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> do not take into account existing non-hierarchical relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>(2) These methods can only be applied to graphs with a single hierarchical relation type, and are thus not suitable to real-world knowledge graphs that simultaneously encode multiple hierarchies using many different relations. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, subClass and partOf each define a unique hierarchy over the same set of entities. However, existing models treat all relations in a KG as part of one single hierarchy, limiting the ability to reason with different types of heterogeneous hierarchical relations. While there are methods for reasoning over KGs that use hyperbolic space (MuRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, RotH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>), which is suitable for modeling tree-like graphs, the choice of relational transformations used in these works (rotation) prevents them from faithfully capturing all the properties of hierarchical relations. For example, they cannot model transitivity of hierarchical relations: if there exist relations (h 1 , r, h 2 ) and (h 2 , r, h 3 ), then (h 1 , r, h 3 ) exists, i.e. h 1 and h 3 are also related by relation r.</p><p>Here we propose a novel hyperbolic knowledge graph embedding model ConE. ConE is motivated by the transitivity of nested angular cones <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that naturally model the partial ordering defined by hierarchical relations. Our proposed approach embeds entities into the product space of hyperbolic planes, where the coordinate in each hyperbolic plane corresponds to a 2D hyperbolic cone. To address challenge (1), we model non-hierarchical relations as hyperbolic cone rotations from head entity to tail entity, while we model hierarchical relations as a restricted rotation which guarantees cone containment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1(b)</ref>). To address challenge (2), we assign distinct embedding subspaces corresponding to product spaces of a different set of hyperbolic planes for each hierarchical relation, to enforce cone containment constraints. By doing so, multiple heterogeneous hierarchies are preserved simultaneously in unique subspaces, allowing ConE to perform multiple hierarchical reasoning tasks accurately.</p><p>We evaluate the performance of ConE on the KG completion task and hierarchical reasoning task.</p><p>A single trained ConE model can achieve remarkable performance on both tasks simultaneously. On KG completion task, ConE achieves new state-of-the-art results on two benchmark knowledge graph datasets including WN18RR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, DDB14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (outperforming by 0.9% and 4.5% on Hits@1 metric). We also develop a novel biological knowledge graph GO21 from biomedical domain and show that ConE successfully models multiple hierarchies induced by different biological processes. We also evaluate our model against previous hierarchical modeling approaches on ancestordescendant prediction task. Results show that ConE significantly outperforms baseline models (by 20% on average when missing links are included), suggesting that it effectively models multiple heterogeneous hierarchies. Moreover, ConE performs well on the lowest common ancestor (LCA) prediction task, improving over previous methods by 100% in Hits@3 metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Hierarchical reasoning. The most related line of work is learning structured embeddings to perform hierarchical reasoning on graphs and ontologies: order embedding, probabilistic order embedding, box embedding, Gumbel-box embedding and hyperbolic embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. These embedding-based methods map entities to various geometric representations that can capture the transitivity and entailment of hierarchical relations. These methods aim to perform hierarchical reasoning (transitive closure completion), such as predicting if an entity is an ancestor of another entity. However, the limitation of the above works is that they can only model a single hierarchical relation, and it remains unexplored how to extend them to multiple hierarchical relations in heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> builds upon the box embedding and further models joint (two) hierarchies using two boxes as entity embeddings. However, the method is not scalable since the model needs to learn a quadratic number of transformation functions between all pairs of hierarchical relations. Furthermore, the missing part is that these methods do not leverage nonhierarchical relations to further improve the hierarchy modeling. For example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(a), with the sisterTerm(PalmTree, MapleTree) and subClass(PalmTree, Tree), we may infer subClass(MapleTree, Tree). In contrast to prior methods, ConE is able to achieve exactly this type of reasoning as it can simultaneously model multiple hierarchical as well as non-hierarchical relations.</p><p>Knowledge graph embedding. Various embedding methods have been proposed to model entities and relations in heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Prominent examples include TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, DistMult <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, ComplEx <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, RotatE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and TuckER <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. These methods often require high embedding dimensionality to model all the triples. Recently KG embeddings based on hyperbolic space have shown success in modeling hierarchical knowledge graphs. MuRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> learns relation-specific parameters in the Poincar? ball model. RotH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> uses rotation and reflection transformation in n-dimensional Poincar? space to model relational patterns, and achieves state-of-the-art for the KG completion task, especially under low-dimensionality. However, transformations used in MuRP and RotH cannot capture transitive relations which hierarchical relations naturally are.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, ConE is the first model that can faithfully model multiple hierarchical as well as non-hierarchical relations in a single embedding framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preliminaries</head><p>Knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embeddings. We denote the entity set and the relation set in knowledge graph as E and R respectively. Each edge in the graph is represented by a triplet (h, r, t), connecting the head entity h ? E and the tail entity t ? E with relation r ? R. In KG embedding models, entities and relations are mapped to vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E ? R d E , R ? R d R .</formula><p>Here d E , d R refer to the dimensionality of entity and relation embeddings, respectively. Specifically, the mapping is learnt via optimizing a defined scoring function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, while maximizing such likelihood only for true triplets.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R d E ? R d R ? R d E ? R measuring the likelihood of triplets</formula><p>Hierarchies in knowledge graphs. Many real-world knowledge graphs contain hierarchical relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Such hierarchical structure is characterized by very few top-level nodes corresponding to general and abstract concepts and a vast number of bottom-level nodes corresponding to concrete instances or components of the concept. Examples of hierarchical relations include isA, partOf. Note that there may exist multiple (heterogeneous) hierarchical relations in the same graph, which induce several different potentially incompatible hierarchies (i.e., partial orderings) over the same set of entities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1(a)</ref>). In contrast to prior work, our approach is able to model many simultaneous hierarchies over the same set of entities.</p><p>Hyperbolic embeddings. Hyperbolic embeddings can naturally capture hierarchical structures. Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry with a constant negative curvature, where curvature measures how a geometric manifold deviates from Euclidean space. In this work, we use Poincar? ball model with constant curvature c = ?1 as the hyperbolic space for entity embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We also investigate on more flexible curvatures, see Appendix B, results show that our model is robust enough with constant curvature c = ?1. In particular, we denote d-dimensional Poincar? ball centered at origin as B d = {x ? R d : x &lt; 1}, where ? is the Euclidean norm. The Poincar? ball model of hyperbolic space is equipped with Riemannian metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g B = ( 2 1 ? x 2 ) 2 g E<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where g E denotes the Euclidean metric, i.e., g E = I d . The mobius addition ? <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> defined on Poincar? ball model with ?1 curvature is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x ? y = (1 + 2 x, y + y 2 )x + (1 ? x 2 )y 1 + 2 x, y + x 2 y 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>For each point x ? B d , the tangent space T x B is the Euclidean vector space containing all tangent vectors at x. One can map vectors in T x B to vectors in B d through exponential map exp x (?) : T x B ? B d as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">exp x (u) = x ? tanh( u 1 ? x ) u u<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Conversely, the logarithmic map log x (?) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">B d ? T x B maps vectors in B d back to vectors in T x B, in particular: log x (u) = (1 ? x ) ? tanh ?1 ( ?x ? v ) ?x ? v ?x ? v<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Also, the hyperbolic distance between x, y ? B d is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d B (x, y) = 2 tanh ?1 ( ?x ? y )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>A key property of hyperbolic space is that the amount of space covered by a ball of radius r in hyperbolic space increases exponentially with respect to r, rather than polynomially as in Euclidean space. This property contributes to the fact that hyperbolic space can naturally model hierarchical tree-like structure.</p><p>Hyperbolic entailment cones. Each hierarchical relation induces a partial ordering over the entities.</p><p>To capture a given partial ordering, we use the hyperbolic entailment cones <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(b) gives an example of 2D hyperbolic cones.</p><p>Let C x denotes the cone at apex x. The goal is to model partial order by containment relationship between cones, in particular, the entailment cones satisfy transitivity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">?x, y ? B d \{0} : y ? C x ? C y ? C x<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Also, for x, y ? B d , we define the angle of y at x to be the angle between the half-lines ? ? ox and ? ? xy and denote it as ? x y. It can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">? x y = cos ?1 ( x, y (1 + x 2 ) ? x 2 (1 + y 2 ) x x ? y 1 + x 2 y 2 ? 2 x, y )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>To satisfy transitivity of nested angular cones and symmetric conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we have the following expression of Poincar? entailment cone at apex x ? B d :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C x = {y ? B d |? x y ? sin ?1 (K 1 ? x 2 x )}<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where K ? R is a hyperparameter (we take K = 0.1). This implies that the half aperture ? x of cone C x is as follows: For hyperbolic planes not in the subspace, we use a general rotation to model r. How to choose a relation-specific subspace for each hierarchical relation is essential and further explained in Sec. 3.3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">? x = sin ?1 (K 1 ? x 2 x )<label>(9)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">ConE Embedding Space and Transformations</head><p>We first introduce the embedding space that ConE operates in, and the transformations used to model hierarchical as well as non-hierarchical relations.</p><p>For ease of discussion let's assume that the relation type is given a priori. In fact, knowledge about hierarchical relations (i.e., transitive closure) is explicitly available in the definition of the relation in KGs such as ConceptNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Gene Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. When such information is not available, ConE can infer "hierarchicalness" of a relation by a simple criteria with slight modification to the Krackhardt scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, see Appendix H.</p><p>Embedding space. The embedding space of ConE, S, is a product space of d hyperbolic planes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, resulting in a total embedding dimension of 2d. S can be denoted as S = B 2 ? B 2 ? ? ? ? ? B 2 . Note that this space is different from RotH embedding space <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which is a single 2d-dimensional hyperbolic space. ConE's embedding space is critical in modeling ancestor-descendant relationships for heterogeneous KGs, since it is more natural when allocating its subspaces (product space of multiple hyperbolic planes) to heterogeneous hierarchical relations.</p><p>We denote the embedding of entity h ? E as h = (h 1 , h 2 , ? ? ? , h d ) where h i ? B 2 is the apex of the i-th 2D hyperbolic cone. We model relation r as a cone transformation on each hyperbolic plane from head entity cone to tail entity cone. Let r = (r 1 , r 2 , ? ? ? , r d ) be the representation of relation r. We use r i = (s i , ? i ) to parameterize transformation for the i-th hyperbolic plane as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. s i &gt; 0 is the scaling factor indicating how far to go in radial direction and (? i ? ? hi /?) is the rotation angle restricted by half aperture ? hi (? i ? [??, ?)). To perform hierarchical tasks such as ancestor-descendant prediction, ConE uses nested cones in each hyperbolic plane to model the partial ordering property of hierarchical relations, by the cone containment constraint in Def. 1. Definition 1. Cone containment constraint. If entity h is an ancestor of t, then the cone embedding of t has to reside in that of the entity h, i.e., C ti ? C hi , ?i ? {1, ...d}.</p><p>The cone containment constraint can be enforced in any of the hyperbolic plane components in S. Next we introduce ConE's transformations for characterizing hierarchical and non-hierarchical patterns of relation r in triple (h, r, t). Note that we utilize both transformations to model hierarchical relations r to capture non-hierarchical properties, i.e., symmetry, composition, etc, as well as hierarchical properties, i.e., partial ordering. We do this by performing different transformations in different subspaces of S, as discussed in detail in Sec. 3.3.</p><p>Transformation for modeling non-hierarchical properties. Rotation is an expressive transformation to capture relation between entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Analogous to RotatE, we adopt rotation transformation f 1 to model non-hierarchical properties <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3</ref>(a)). For rotation in the i-th hyperbolic plane,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f 1 (h i , r i ) = exp o (G(? i ) log o (h i ))<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where G(? i ) is the Givens rotation matrix:  We also show that the rotation transformation in Eq. 10 is expressive: It can model relation patterns including symmetry, anti-symmetry, inversion, and composition (Appendix A.1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">G(? i ) = cos(? i ) ? sin(? i ) sin(? i ) cos(? i )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Transformation for modeling hierarchical properties. However, f 1 cannot be directly applied to model hierarchical relations, because rotation does not obey transitive property: rotation by ? i twice will result in a rotation of 2? i , instead of ? i . Hence it cannot guarantee (h 1 , r, h 3 ) when (h 1 , r, h 2 ) and (h 2 , r, h 3 ) are true. We use restricted rotation transformation f 2 to model hierarchical relations. We impose cone containment constraint to preserve partial ordering of cones after the transformation. Without loss of generality we assume relation r is a hyponym type relation, the restricted rotation from h to t in i-th hyperbolic plane is as follows (we perform restricted rotation from t to h if r is a hypernym relation):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f 2 (h i , r i ) = exp hi (s i ? G(? i ? h i ? )h i ), r i = (s i , ? i )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where ? h i is the half aperture of cone h i . h i is the unit vector of h i in the tangent space of h i : <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>(b) illustrates the two-step transformation described in Eq. 12, namely the scaling step and the rotation step.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h i = h i /|| h i ||, h i = log hi ( 1 + ||h i || 2||h i || h i )<label>(13)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">ConE Model of Heterogeneous Hierarchies</head><p>In the previous section, we explained how we enforce cone containment constraint for hierarchical relations, however two challenges remain when simultaneously modeling multiple heterogeneous hierarchies: (1) Partial ordering: Suppose that there is a hyponym relation between entities h 1 and h 2 , and a different hyponym relation between entities h 2 and h 3 . Then a na?ve model would enforce that the cone of h 1 contains the cone of h 2 which contains the cone of h 3 , implying that a hyponym relation exists between h 1 and h 3 , which is not correct.</p><p>(2) Expressive power: Cone containment constraint, while ensuring hierarchical structure by geometric entailment, limits the set of possible rotation transformations and thus limits the model's expressive power.</p><p>To address these challenges we proceed as follows. Instead of enforcing cone containment constraint in the entire embedding space, ConE proposes a novel technique to assign unique subspace for each hierarchical relation, i.e. we enforce cone containment constraint only in a subset of d hyperbolic planes. Next we further elaborate on this idea.</p><p>In particular, for a hierarchical relation r, we assign a corresponding subspace of S, which is a product space of a subset of hyperbolic planes. Then, we use restricted rotation in the subspace and rotation in the complement space. We train ConE to enforce cone containment constraint in the relation-specific subspace. The subspace can be represented by a d-dimensional mask m, m i ? {0, 1}, and m i = 1 indicates that cone containment is enforced in the i-th hyperbolic plane. We then extend such notation to all relations where m = 0 for non-hierarchical relations.  Our design of leveraging both transformations to model hierarchical relations is crucial in that they capture different aspects of the relation. The use of restricted rotation along with cone containment constraint serves to preserve partial ordering of a hierarchical relation in its relation-specific subspace. But restricted rotation alone is insufficient: hierarchical relations also possess other properties such as composition and symmetry that cannot be modeled by restricted rotation. Hence we augment with the rotation transformation to capture these properties, allowing composition of different hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations through rotations in the complement space. We further provide theoretical and empirical results in Appendix A to support that both transformations are of great significance to the expressiveness of our model.</p><p>Putting it all together gives us the following distance scoring function (we use (v i ) i?{1,??? ,d} in the following to denote a d-dimensional vector v):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">?(h, r, t) = ? 1 d [m ? (d B (f 2 (h i , r i ), t i )) i?{1,??? ,d} +(1 ? m) ? (d B (f 1 (h i , r i ), t i )) i?{1,??? ,d} ] + b h + b t<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where the first term corresponds to the restricted rotation in relation-specific subspace, and the second term corresponds to the rotation in complementary space. A high score indicates that cone of entity h after relation-specific transformation r is close to the cone of entity t in terms of hyperbolic distance d B . Note that b h , b t are the learnt radius parameters of h, t which can be interpreted as margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Subspace allocation. We assign equal dimensional subspaces for all hierarchical relations. We discuss and compare several strategies in assigning subspaces for hierarchical relations in Appendix B, including whether to use overlapping subspaces or orthogonal subspaces for different hierarchical relations, as well as the choice of dimensionality of subspaces. Overlapping subspaces (Appendix B) allow the model to perform well and enable it to scale to knowledge graphs with a large number of relations, since there are exponentially many possible overlapping subspaces that can potentially correspond to different hierarchical relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">ConE Loss Function</head><p>We use a loss function composed of two parts. The first part of the loss function aims to ensure that for a given head entity h and relation r the distance to the true tail entity t is smaller than to the negative tail entity t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L d (h, r, t) = ? log ?(?(h, r, t)) ? t ?T 1 |T | log ?(??(h, r, t ))<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where (h, r, t) denotes a positive training example/triplet, and we generate negative samples (h, r, t ) by substituting the tail with a random entity in T ? E, a random set of entities in KG excluding t.</p><p>However, the distance loss L d does not guarantee embeddings satisfying the cone containment constraint, since the distance between transformed head embedding and tail embedding can still be non-zero after training. Hence we additionally introduce the angle loss (without loss of generality let r be a hyponym relation):</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L a (h, r, t) = m ? (max(0, ? hi t i ? ?(h i ))) i?{1,??? ,d}<label>(16)</label></formula><p>which directly encourages cone of h to contain cone of t in relation-specific subspaces, by constraining the angle between the cones. The final loss is then a weighted sum of the distance loss and the angle loss, where weight w is a hyperparameter (We investigate the choice of w in Appendix B):  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Ancestor-descendant prediction results in mAP (mean average precision).

(Training details and standard deviations in Appendix G). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> We use a single trained model (without fine-tuning) for all evaluation tasks: On ancestor-descendant relationship prediction, our scoring function for a pair (h, t) with hierarchical relation r is the angle loss in Eq. 16 where a lower score means h is more likely to be an ancestor of t.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Hierarchical Reasoning: Ancestor-descendant Prediction</head><p>Next we define ancestor-descendant relationship prediction task to test model's ability on hierarchical reasoning. Given two entities, the goal makes a binary prediction if they have ancestor-descendant relationship:</p><p>Definition 2. Ancestor-descendant relationship. Entity pair (h 1 , h 2 ) is considered to have ancestordescendant relationship if: there exists a path from h 1 to h 2 that only contains one type of hyponym relation, or a path from h 2 to h 1 that only contains one type of hypernym relation.</p><p>Our evaluation setting is a generalization of the transitive closure prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> which is defined only over a single hierarchy, but our knowledge graphs contain multiple hierarchies (hierarchical relations). More precisely: (1) When heterogeneous hierarchies coexist in the graph, we compute the transitive closure induced by each hierarchical relation separately. The test set for each hierarchical relation is a random collection sampled from all transitive closures of that relation. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref> To increase the difficulty of the prediction task, our evaluation also considers inferred descendant pairs, which are only possible to be inferred when simultaneously considering hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations in KG, due to missing links in KG. We call a descendant pair (u, v) an inferred descendant pair if their ancestor-descendant relationship can be inferred from the whole graph but not from the training set. For instance, (Tree,WinePalm) would be an inferred descendant pair if the subClass relation between Tree and PalmTree is missing in training set. We construct the inferred descendant pairs by taking the transitive closures of the entire graph, and exclude the transitive closures of relations in the training set. In our experiments, we consider three test settings: 0%, 50%, 100%, corresponding to the fraction of inferred descendant pairs among all true descendant pairs in the test set, and the setting with a higher fraction is harder. On each dataset, we extract 50k ancestor-descendant pairs. For each pair, we randomly replace the true descendant with a random entity in the graph, resulting in a total of 100k pairs. Our way of selecting negative examples offsets the bias during learning that is prevalent in baseline models: the models tend to always give higher scores to pairs with a high-level node as ancestor, since high-level nodes usually have more descendants presented in training data. We replace the true descendant while keeping the true ancestor unchanged for the negative sample, and thus the model will not be able to "cheat" by taking advantage of the fore-mentioned bias. For each model, we then use its scoring function to rank all the pairs. We use the standard mean average precision (mAP) to evaluate the performance on this binary classification task. We further show the AUROC results in Appendix E.</p><p>Baselines. We compare our method with state-of-the-art methods for hierarchical reasoning, including Order embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Poincar? embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and Hyperbolic entailment cones <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Note that these methods can only handle a single hierarchical relation at a time. So each baseline trains a separate embedding for each hierarchical relation and then learns a scoring function on the embedding of the two entities. To ensure that the experiment controls the model size, we enforce that in baselines, the sum of embedding dimensions of all relations is equal to the relation embedding dimension of ConE. We also perform comprehensive hyperparameter search for all baselines (Appendix G). Although KG embedding models (RotatE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and RotH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) cannot be directly applied to this task, we adapt them to perform this task by separately training an MLP to make binary classification on ancestor-descendant pair, taking the concatenation of the two entity embeddings as input. Note that ConE outperforms these KG completion methods without even requiring additional training.</p><p>Results. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports the ancestor-descendant prediction results of ConE and the baselines. We observe that the novel subspace transformation of ConE results in its superior performance in this task. Our model consistently outperforms baseline methods on all three datasets. As we expected, KG embedding models cannot perform well on this task (in the range of 0.5 ? 0.6 across all settings), since they do not explicitly model the partial ordering property of the hierarchical relations. In contrast, our visualization of ConE's embedding in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> suggests that ConE faithfully preserves the cone containment constraint in modeling hierarchical relations, while RotH's embedding exhibit less hierarchical structure. As a result, ConE simultaneously captures the heterogeneous relation modeling and partial ordering, combining the best of both worlds. Our improvement is more significant as the fraction of inferred descendant pairs increases. This shows that ConE not only embeds a given hierarchical structure, but can also infer missing hierarchical links by modeling other non-hierarchical relations at the same time. Thanks to the restricted rotation transformation and the use of product spaces of hyperbolic planes, ConE can faithfully model the hierarchies without requiring all transitive closures in the training set. We further perform additional studies to explore reasons for the performance of each method on ancestor-descendant prediction task in Appendix E.</p><p>Lowest common ancestor prediction task.

Over the first three hierarchical datasets considered, ConE achieves state-of-the-art results over many recent baselines, including the recently proposed hyperbolic approaches RotH and MuRP. We also notice that the margins on Hits@1 and Hits@3 scores are much larger than Hits@10, indicating that our model provides the most accurate predictions. We further use Krackhardt scores ? to measure how hierarchical each graph is <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The score consists of four metrics ((connectedness, hierarchy, efficiency, LUBedness), Appendix H), where if a graph is maximally hierarchical (i.e., a tree) then its Krackhardt score is <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(1, 1, 1, 1)</ref>, and higher score on four metrics indicate a more hierarchical structure. Notice that the Krackhardt scores of FB15k-237 are approximately three times lower than those of WN18RR, DDB14 and GO21, indicating that FB15k-237 is indeed non-hierarchical. We can see that our ConE model still performs better than other hierarchical KG embedding models (RotH and MuRP) on FB15k-237 and is comparable to SOTA model (TuckER). Overall, this shows that ConE can scale to a large number of relations, and that it has competitive performance even in non-hierarchical knowledge graphs.</p><p>We further analyze the performance of ConE in low-dimensional regimes in Appendix C. Similar to previous studies, the hyperbolic-space-based ConE model performs much better than Euclidean KG embeddings in low dimensions (d = 32). ConE performs similar to previous hyperbolic KG embedding baselines in low dimensions, but outperforms them in high-dimensional regimes ( <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>Ablation study. We further compare the performance of our model with one that does not use cone restricted rotation for modeling hierarchical relations and one that does not use rotation for modeling hierarchical relations. Ablation results suggest that both transformations, i.e., cone restricted rotation and rotation, are critical in predicting missing hierarchical relations (Appendix A.2). In particular, our ablation results on each individual hierarchical relation suggest that with cone restricted rotation, ConE can simultaneously model heterogeneous hierarchical relations effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose ConE, a hierarchical KG embedding method that models entities as hyperbolic cones and uses different transformations between cones to simultaneously capture hierarchical and non-hierarchical relation patterns. We apply cone containment constraint to relation-specific subspaces to capture hierarchical information in heterogeneous knowledge graphs. ConE can simultaneously perform knowledge graph completion task and hierarchical task, and achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks across three hierarchical knowledge graph datasets.

Let T denote the set of all true triples. We formally define the three relation patterns as follows. Proof. If r is a symmetric relation, then for each triple (h, r, t), its symmetric triple (t, r, h) is also true. For i ? {1, 2, ? ? ? , d}, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">t i = exp o (G(? i ) log o (h i )), h i = exp o (G(? i ) log o (t i ))</formula><p>Let I denote the identity matrix.

Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, we take logarithmic map on rotation transformation, then Proof. If relation r 1 is composed of r 2 and r 3 , then triple (h, r 1 , t) exists when (h, r 2 , m) and (m, r 3 , t) exist.

For any triple (h, r, t) where r is a hierarchical relation, we will prove that cone containment constraint is satisfied after the restricted rotation from h to t, i.e., C f2(hi,ri) ? C hi .

However, its effect on knowledge graph completion task remains unknown. We further compare the performance of ConE with one that does not use cone restricted rotation for modeling hierarchical relations, which we name as RotC.

Ablation results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>.

We observe significant improvement on all hierarchical relations, which shows our way of modeling heterogeneous hierarchies to be effective. Note that up to 72% improvement is achieved for some hierarchical relation thanks to the restricted rotation operation in ConE.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Strategies in assigning relation-specific subspace and embedding space curvature</head><p>We compare several strategies for assigning subspace for each hierarchical relation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1 Overlapping subspaces and orthogonal subspaces</head><p>First, we compare the results on ancestor-descendant prediction and knowledge graph completion between different subspace assigning strategies, i.e., using overlapping subspaces and using orthogonal subspaces. We conduct the experiment on WN18RR dataset. For both strategies, the embedding dimension d = 500 and the subspace dimension d s = 70 for each hierarchical relation (7 hierarchical relations in total hence it is possible to assign orthogonal subspaces). For assigning overlapping subspaces, since it is impossible to investigate all possible combinations, we randomly choose d s out of d number of hyperbolic planes to each hierarchical relation. To avoid the randomness of the results due to our method in assigning overlapping subspaces, we repeat the experiment multiple times and take the average for the final result.</p><p>Results. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> reports the results on ancestor-descendant prediction task as well as knowledge graph completion task. Between two strategies, ConE performs slightly better on knowledge graph completion task under overlapping subspaces, while their performances are comparable on ancestordescendant prediction task. The most significant advantage for using overlapping subspaces is that it does not suffer from limitation of subspace dimension, while for orthogonal subspaces the subspace dimension can be at most d/n where n is the number of hierarchical relations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2 Subspace dimension and angle loss weight</head><p>We also study the effect of subspace dimension d s and angle loss weight w (in Eq. 17) on the performance of ConE. We use overlapping subspaces where we randomly choose d s out of d = 500 hyperbolic planes to compose the subspace for each hierarchical relation.</p><p>Results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> reports the results on both tasks in curves. We notice a trade-off between two tasks for subspace dimension, where a larger dimension contributes to better performance on hierarchical task, while limiting the performance on knowledge graph completion task. With larger angle loss weight w, cone containment constraint is enforced more strictly, and thus the performance of ConE on hierarchical task improves as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5(a)</ref>. On the other hand, ConE reaches peak performance on knowledge graph completion task at w = 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3 Space curvature</head><p>Aside from setting fixed curvature c = ?1, we also investigate on learning curvature, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> suggests that fixing the curvature has a negative impact on performance of RotH. With learning curvature, ConE has (MRR, H@1, H@3, H@10) = (0.485, 0.441, 0.501, 0.570), on WN18RR benchmark, lower than original ConE with fixed curvature with (MRR, H@1, H@3, H@10) = (0.496, 0.453, 0.515, 0.579). The reason why RotH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> needs learning space curvature while ConE does not lie in the choice of embedding space: RotH uses a 2d-dimensional hyperbolic space while ConE uses product space of d hyperbolic planes. Our embedding space is less sensitive to its curvature, since for every subspace, the hierarchical structure for the corresponding single relation is less complex (than the entire hierarchy), and can thus be robust to choices of curvatures.</p></div>

Formally, let l uv denote the hierarchy gap (Def. 6) between u and v and l uv = ? if u is not an ancestor of v, then we define LCA(u, v) = argmin w?E [(l wu + l wv )].

Formally, the degree of connectedness is connectedness = c n(n ? 1)/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> where c is the number of connected pairs and n is the total number of nodes.</p><p>2. Hierarchy. Hierarchy measures the order property of the relations in the graph. If for each pair of nodes such that one node u can reach the other node v, v cannot reach u, then the hierarchy score is 1. In knowledge graph this implies that if (u, rel, v) ? T then (v, rel, u) / ? T. Let T denote the set of ordered pairs (u, v) such that u can reach v, and S = {(v, u)|(u, v) ? T, v cannot reach u}, the degree of hierarchy is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">hierarchy = |S| |T |<label>(22)</label></formula><p>3. Efficiency. Another condition to make sure that a structure is a tree is that the graph contains exactly n ? 1 edges, given n number of nodes. In other word, the graph cannot have redundant edges. The degree of efficiency is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">efficiency = 1 ? ? ? m ? (n ? 1) (n ? 1)(n ? 2)/2<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where m is the number of edges in the graph. Numerator m ? (n ? 1) is the number of redundant edges in the graph while denominator (n ? 1)(n ? 2)/2 is the maximum number of redundant edges possible. In the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, ? is set to 1, in our case we take ? = 500 to make the gap larger since common knowledge graph are always sparse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">LUBedness.</head><p>The last condition for a tree structure is that every pair of nodes has a least upper bound, which is the same as our defined LCA concept (in Sec. F) in knowledge graph case. Different from the homogeneous setting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, we still restrict LCA to a single relation (same relation on the paths between the pair of nodes and their LCA), since heterogeneous hierarchies may exist in a single KG. Let T = {(u, v)|(u, v) has a LCA}, then the degree of LUBedness is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">LUBedness = |T | n(n ? 1)<label>(24)</label></formula><p>H.2 Hierarchical-ness scores for each relation</p><p>Here we introduce the Hierarchical-ness scores for each relation, which is a modified version of original Krackhardt scores on the induced subgraph of a relation. We observe, using the groundtruth hypernym, hyponym and non-hierarchical relations in existing datasets (WN18RR, DDB14, GO21), that the Hierarchical-ness scores for hypernym, hyponym and non-hierarchical relations can be easily separated via decision boundaries. To apply ConE on a dataset where the type of relation is not available, we can compute the Hierarchical-ness scores of the relations, and classify the hierarchical-ness of the relations via the decision boundaries.</p><p>Here we introduce the computation of our Hierarchical-ness scores, which contain two terms: (asymmetry, tree_likeness).</p><p>1. Asymmetry. The asymmetry metric is the same as hierarchy metric in Krackhardt scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Tree_likeness.</head><p>The tree_likeness metric is adapted from the LUBedness metric in Krackhardt scores where three adjustments are made:</p><p>(a) The subgraph induced by a single relation is not guaranteed to be connected, and forest is a typical hierarchical structure in such a disconnected graph. We cannot make sure every pair of nodes are in the same tree, and thus we evaluate on all connected pairs and check whether they have an LCA. Let P denote the set of pairs (u, v) such that u and v are connected, and the set Q = {(u, v)|(u, v) ? P and (u, v) has a LCA}. Then our new LUBedness' for disconnected graph is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">LUBedness' = |Q| |P |<label>(25)</label></formula><p>(b) We want to distinguish true hierarchical relations from common 1-N relations, where the transitivity property may not hold (for example, participants of some event entity is a 1-N relation, yet it does not define a partial ordering since the head entity and tail entity are not the same type of entities). This kind of relation can be characterized by 1-depth trees in their induced subgraph, while hierarchical relations usually induce trees of greater depth. Hence we add punishment to the induced subgraphs containing mostly 1-depth trees to exclude non-hierarchical 1-N relations. In particular, let E denote the set of edges, and S = {u|?v : (u, v) ? E or (v, u) ? E}, T = {u|?v : (u, v) ? E and (v, u) ? E}. If 1-depth trees are prevalent in the structure, then |T | is approximately 0. We define the punishment decaying factor (lower means more punishment):</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">d = |T | |S|<label>(26)</label></formula><p>(c) LUBedness metric also depends on the direction of the relation, since LCA exists only if the relations are hyponym type (pointing from parent node to child nodes) while hypernym type relation can also define a partial ordering and considered as hierarchical relation. Hence for each relation, we define two induced graphs G and G rev , G in original direction and G rev in reversed direction. We calculate the LUBedness metric of the two graphs, if the score of G is much higher than the score of G rev then the relation is of hyponym type, and vice versa. We take the absolute value of LU Bedness (G) ? LU Bedness (G rev ) as the score to measure the hierarchical-ness while its sign to check if it is of hypernym type or hyponym type.</p><p>Finally, our tree_likeness metric is calculated through tree_likeness = (LU Bedness (G) ? LU Bedness (G rev ))/ max(1, (log 10 (d)) 2 )</p><p>We show that our Hierarchical-ness scores indicate the type of relation on WN18RR, DDB14 and GO21 datasets. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref>(a), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>(a), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 9</ref>(a), we visualize the two-dimensional scores for each relation in the three datasets. Groundtruth hypernym type relations are colored in orange and hyponym relations are colored in violet. We can see that hypernym type relations are clustered  1.00 belong(s) to the category of is a category subset of may cause is a subtype of is a risk factor for is associated with may contraindicate interacts with belongs to the drug family of belongs to drug super-family is a vector for may be allelic with see also  in lower right while hyponym type relations are clustered in upper right, indicating that hyponym type relations have large asymmetry score and large positive tree_likeness score while hyponym type relations have large asymmetry score and large negative tree_likeness score. Moreover, We use asymmetry + |tree_likeness| as the total Hierarchical-ness score and set threshold 1.1 to separate hierarchical relations and non-hierarchical relations. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref>(b), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>(b), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 9</ref>(b), our classification results highly conform to the groundtruth relation type.</p><p>Additionally, we use our Hierarchical-ness scores to distinguish hierarchical relations from 237 relations in FB15k-237, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>(a), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>(b). Since there is no labeling of relation type in FB15k-237, we do not have groundtruth. We label the relations that rank highest    on Hierarchical-ness score and discover that they are indeed hierarchical relations (suggested by keywords in their name, such as "child", "parent").</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Hyperbolic entailment cones in 2D hyperbolic plane for K = 0.1.</figDesc></figure>
