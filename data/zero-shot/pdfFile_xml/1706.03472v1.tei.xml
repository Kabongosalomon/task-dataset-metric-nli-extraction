<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Topological data analysis is an emerging mathematical concept for characterizing shapes in multi-scale data. In this field, persistence diagrams are widely used as a descriptor of the input data, and can distinguish robust and noisy topological properties. Nowadays, it is highly desired to develop a statistical framework on persistence diagrams to deal with practical data. This paper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams. A theoretical contribution of our method is that the proposed kernel allows one to control the effect of persistence, and, if necessary, noisy topological properties can be discounted in data analysis. Furthermore, the method provides a fast approximation technique. The method is applied into several problems including practical data in physics, and the results show the advantage compared to the existing kernel method on persistence diagrams.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in utilizing methods of algebraic topology for statistical data analysis. In terms of algebraic topology, conventional clustering methods are regarded as charactering 0-dimensional topological features which mean connected components of data. Furthermore, higher dimensional topological features also represent informative shape of data, such as rings (1-dimension) and cavities (2-dimension). The research analyzing these topological features in data is called topological data analysis (TDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Car09]</ref>, which has been successfully applied to various areas including information science <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[CIdSZ08,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">dSG07]</ref>, biology [KZP + 07, XW14], brain science [LCK + 11, PET + 14, SMI + 08], biochemistry [GHI + 15], material science [HNH + 16, NHH + 15, STR + 17], and so on. In many of these applications, data have complicated geometric structures, and thus it is important to extract informative topological features from the data.</p><p>A persistent homology <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[ELZ02]</ref>, which is a key mathematical tool in TDA, extracts robust topological information from data, and it has a compact expression called a persistence diagram. While it is applied to various problems such as the ones listed above, statistical or machine learning methods for analysis on persistence diagrams are still limited. In TDA, analysts often elaborate only single persistence diagram and, in particular, methods for handling many persistence diagrams, which can contain randomness from the data, are at the beginning stage (see the end of this section for related works). Hence, developing a framework of statistical data analysis on persistence diagrams is a significant issue for further success of TDA and, to this goal, this paper discusses kernel methods for persistence diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Topological descriptor</head><p>In order to provide some intuitions for the persistent homology, let us consider a typical way of constructing persistent homology from data points in a Euclidean space, assuming that the point set lies on a submanifold. The aim is to make inference on the topology of the underlying manifold from finite data points. We consider the r-balls (balls with radius r) to recover the topology of the manifold, as popularly employed in constructing an r-neighbor graph in many manifold learning algorithms. While it is expected that, with an appropriate choice of r, the r-ball model can represent the underlying topological structures of the manifold, it is also known that the result is sensitive to the choice of r. If r is too small (resp. large), the union of r-balls consists simply of the disjoint r-balls (resp. a contractible space). Then, by considering not one specific r but all r, the persistent homology gives robust topological features of the point set. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Unions of r-balls at data points (left) and its 1-st persistence diagram (right). The point (b 1 , d 1 ) in the persistence diagram represents the ring ? 1 , which appears at r = b 1 and disappears at r = d 1 . The noisy rings are plotted as the points close to the diagonal.</p><p>As a useful representation of persistent homology, a persistence diagram is often used in topological data analysis. The persistence diagram is given in the form of a multiset D = {(b i , d i ) ? R 2 | i ? I, b i &lt; d i } ( <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>). Every point (b i , d i ) ? D, called a generator of the persistent homology, represents a topological property (e.g., connected components, rings, cavities, etc.) which appears at r = b i and disappears at r = d i in the ball model. Then, the persistence d i ? b i of the generator shows the robustness of the topological property under the radius parameter. A generator with large persistence can be regarded as a reliable structure, while that with small persistence (points close to the diagonal) is likely to be a structure caused by noise. In this way, persistence diagrams encode topological and geometric information of data points. See Section 2 and Appendix A for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contribution</head><p>Since a persistence diagram is a point set of variable size, it is not straightforward to apply standard methods of statistical data analysis, which typically assume vectorial data. To vectorize persistence diagrams, we employ the framework of kernel embedding of (probability and more general) measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). This framework has recently been developed and leading various new methods for nonparametric inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[MFSSar,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">SGSS07,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">SFG13]</ref>. It is known [SFL11] that, with an appropriate choice of kernels, a signed Radon measure can be uniquely represented by the Bochner integral of the feature vectors with respect to the measure. Since a persistence diagram can be regarded as a sum of Dirac delta measures, it can be embedded into an RKHS by the Bochner integral. Once such a vector representation is obtained, we can introduce any kernel methods for persistence diagrams systematically (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Furthermore, since each generator in a persistence diagram is equipped with a persistence which indicates a robustness of the topological features, we will utilize it as a weight on the generator. For embedding persistence diagrams in an RKHS, we propose a useful class of positive definite kernels, called persistence weighted Gaussian kernel (PWGK). The advantages of this kernel are as follows: (i) We can explicitly control the effect of persistence by a weight function, and hence discount the noisy generators appropriately in statistical analysis. (ii) As a theoretical contribution, the distance defined by the RKHS norm for the PWGK satisfies the stability property, which ensures the continuity from data to the vector representation of the persistence diagram. (iii) The PWGK allows efficient computation by using the random Fourier features <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[RR07]</ref>, and thus it is applicable to persistence diagrams with a large number of generators.</p><p>We demonstrate the performance of the proposed kernel method with synthesized and real-world data, including granular systems (taken by X-ray Computed Tomography on granular experiments), oxide glasses (taken by molecular dynamics simulations) and protein datasets (taken by NMR and X-ray crystallography experiments). We remark that these real-world problems have physical and biochemical significance in their own right, as detailed in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2:</head><p>(1) A data set X is transformed into a persistence diagram D q (X) (Section 2.1). (2) The persistence diagram D q (X) is mapped to an RKHS vector E k (? w Dq(X) ), where k is a positive definite kernel and w is a weight function controlling the effect of persistence (Section 3.1). (3) Statistical methods are applied to those vector representations of persistence diagrams (Section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Related works</head><p>There are already some relevant works on statistical approaches to persistence diagrams. Some studies discuss how to transform a persistence diagram to a vector [AEK + 17, Bub15, CMW + 15, COO15, RHBK15, RT16]. In these methods, a transformed vector is typically expressed in a Euclidean space R k or a function space L p , and simple and ad-hoc summary statistics like means and variances are used for data analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machines (SVMs). In this paper, we will compare the performance among the PWGK, the persistence scale-space kernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[RHBK15]</ref>, the persistence landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Bub15]</ref>, the persistence image [AEK + 17], and the molecular topological fingerprint [CMW + 15] in several machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that our vectorization is a generalization of the persistence scalespace kernel and the persistence image although the constructions are different. We also remark that there are some works discussing statistical properties of persistence diagrams for random data points: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[CGLM15]</ref> show convergence rates of persistence diagram estimation, and [FLR + 14] discuss confidence sets in a persistence diagram. These works consider a different but important direction to the statistical methods for persistence diagrams.</p><p>The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review some basics on persistence diagrams and kernel embedding methods. In Section 3, the PWGK is proposed, and some theoretical and computational issues are discussed. Section 4 shows experimental results and compares the proposed kernel method with other methods. This paper is an extended version of our ICML paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[KHF16]</ref>. The difference from this conference version is as follows: (i) Comparisons with other relevant methods, in particular, persistence landscapes and persistence images, have been added to this version. (ii) New experimental results in comparison with other relevant methods. (iii) Detailed proofs of the stability theorem has been added.</p></div>

In this section, we will first introduce this mathematical framework of persistence diagrams. Then, by using a ball model filtration, we will intuitively explain geometrical meanings of persistence diagrams. The ball model filtrations can be generalized toward two constructions using?ech complexes and sub-level sets. The former construction is useful for computations of persistence diagrams and the later is useful to discuss theoretical properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Stability of persistence diagrams</head><p>When we consider data analysis based on persistence diagrams, it is useful to introduce a distance measure among persistence diagrams for describing their relations. In introducing a distance measure, it is desirable that, as a representation of data, the mapping from data to a persistence diagram is continuous with respect to the distance. In many cases, data involve noise or stochasticity, and thus the persistence diagrams should be stable under perturbation of data.</p><p>The bottleneck distance d B between two persistence diagrams D and E is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d B (D, E) := inf ? sup x?D?? x ? ?(x) ? ,</formula><p>where ? := {(a, a) | a ? R} is the diagonal set with infinite multiplicity and ? ranges over all multi-bijections 6 from D ?? to E ??. Here, for z = (z 1 , z 2 ) ? R 2 , z ? denotes max{|z 1 |, |z 2 |}. We note that there always exists such a multi-bijection ? because the cardinalities of D ? ? and E ? ? are equal by considering the diagonal set ? with infinite multiplicity. For sets X and Y in a metric space (M, d M ), let us recall the Hausdorff distance d H given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">d H (X, Y ) := max sup x?X inf y?Y d M (x, y), sup y?Y inf x?X d M (x, y) .</formula><p>Then, the bottleneck distance satisfies the following stability property.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Proposition 2.2 ([CdSO14, CSEH07])</formula><p>. Let X and Y be finite subsets in a metric space (M, d M ). Then the persistence diagrams satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d B (D q (X), D q (Y )) ? d H (X, Y ).</formula><p>Proposition 2.2 provides a geometric intuition of the stability of persistence diagrams. Assume that two point sets X and Y are close to each other with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>). Thus, the stability guarantees the similarity of two persistence diagrams, and hence we can infer the true topological features from the persistence diagrams given by noisy observation (see also [FLR + 14]). For 1 ? p &lt; ?, the p-Wasserstein distance d Wp , which is also used as a distance between two persistence diagrams D and E, is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">? = d H (X, Y ).

However, this bound may be weak because, in general, card (D) cannot be bounded from above. In particular, if data set has noise, the persistence diagram often has many generators close to the diagonal. Thus, it is desirable that the total persistence is bounded from above independently of card (D). In the case of persistence diagrams obtained from a ball model filtration, we have the following upper bound (see Appendix B for the proof):</p><p>Lemma 2.4.

To this goal, we explain slightly different two ways of embeddings, which turn out to give the same inner product for two persistence diagrams. First, for a persistence diagram D, we introduce a measure ? w D := x?D w(x)? x with a weight w(x) &gt; 0 for each generator x ? D ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 5)</ref>, where ? x is the Dirac delta measure at x.

(ii) It is also shown that the persistence image has a stability result with respect to 1-Wasserstein distance, but it does not satisfy the bottleneck stability (Remark 1 in [AEK + 17]) or the Haussdorff stability as noted after Theorem 3.3. (iii) The computational complexity of a persistence image does not depend on the number of generators in a persistence diagram, but instead, it depends on the number of pixels. We can reduce the computational time of the persistence image by choosing a small mesh size M . However, as data in Section 4.2, some situations need a fine mesh (i.e., a large mesh size). Thus, we have to be careful with the choice of mesh size.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">SVM results</head><p>SVMs are trained from persistence diagrams given by 100 data sets, and evaluated with 100 independent test data sets. As a positive definite kernel k, we choose the Gaussian kernel k G and the linear kernel k L (x, y) := x, y R 2 . For a weight function w, we use the proposed function w arc (x) = arctan(Cpers(x) p ), the piecewise linear weighting function w pers (x) defined in Section 4.1.3, and an unweighted function w one (x) ? 1. The hyperparameters (?, C) in the PWGK and t in the PSSK are chosen by the 10-fold cross-validation, and the degree p in w arc (x) is set as 1, 5, 10. For K PSS and K PL , while they originally consider only the inner product, we also apply the Gaussian kernels on RKHS following Equation (11). Since K PI can be seen as a discretization of the (k G , w pers )-linear kernel, we also construct another kernel of persistence image by replacing w pers with w arc , which is considered as a discretization of the PWGK. In order to check whether the persistence image with w arc is an appropriate discretization of the PWGK, we try several mesh size M = 20, 50, 100. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, we can see that the PWGK and the Gaussian kernel on the persistence image with w arc and large mesh size 100 show higher classification rates (85% accuracy) than the other methods (K PSS : 50%, K PL : 50%, and K PI : 55%). Although the (k G , w pers )-Gaussian kernel and the persistence image with the original weight w pers discount noisy generators, the classification rates are close the chance level. These unfavorable results must be caused by the difficulty in handling the local and global locations of generators simultaneously. While the result of the persistence image with a large mesh size is similar to that of the PWGK (e.g., and 100 ), a small mesh size gives bad approximation results (e.g., and 50 ). The reason is because a small mesh size makes rough pixels, and S 2 itself and noisy generators are treated in some rough pixel. On the other hand, we remark that a large mesh size M needs much computational time since the computational complexity of the persistence image depends on O(M 2 ).</p><p>We observe that the classification accuracies are not sensitive to p. Thus, in the rest of this paper, we set p = 5 because the assumption p &gt; d + 1 in Theorem 3.3 ensures the continuity in the kernel embedding of persistence diagrams and all data points are obtained from R 3 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Analysis of SiO 2</head><p>When we rapidly cool down the liquid state of SiO 2 , it avoids the usual crystallization and changes into a glass state. Understanding the liquid-glass transition is an important issue for the current physics and industrial applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[GS07]</ref>. Glass is an amorphous solid, which does not have a clear structure in the configuration of molecules, but it is also known that the medium distance structure such as rings have important influence on the physical properties of the material. It is thus promising to apply the persistent homology to express the topological and geometrical structure of the glass configuration. For estimating the glass transition temperature by simulations, a traditional physical method is to prepare atomic configurations of SiO 2 for a certain range of temperatures by molecular dynamics simulations, and then draw the temperature-enthalpy graph. The graph consists of two lines in high and low temperatures with slightly different slopes which correspond to the liquid and the glass states, respectively, and the glass transition temperature is conventionally estimated as an interval of the transient region combining these two lines (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Ell90]</ref>). However, since the slopes of two lines are close to each other, determining the interval is a subtle problem. Usually only the rough estimate of the interval is available.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Discussions</head><p>One of the contributions of this paper is to introduce a kernel framework to topological data analysis with persistence diagrams. We applied the kernel embedding approach to vectorize the persistence diagrams, which enables us to utilize any standard kernel methods for data analysis. Another contribution is to propose a kernel specific to persistence diagrams, that is called persistence weighted Gaussian kernel (PWGK). As a significant advantage, our kernel enables one to control the effect of persistence in data analysis. We have also proven the stability property with respect to the distance in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we have analyzed the synthesized and real data by using the proposed kernel. The change point detection, the principal component analysis, and the support vector machine derived meaningful results for the tasks. From the viewpoint of computations, our kernel can utilize an efficient approximation to compute the Gram matrix. One of the main theoretical results of this paper is the stability of the PWGK (Theorem 3.3). It is obtained as a corollary of Proposition 3.2 by restricting the class of persistence diagrams to that obtained from ball model filtrations. The reason of this restriction is because the total persistence can be bounded from above independent of the persistence diagram. Thus, one direction to extend this work is to examine the boundedness condition about the total persistence of other persistence diagrams, for example obtained from sub-level sets or Rips complexes.</p><p>Another direction to extend this work is to generalize the class of weight functions. The reason of the choice of w arc is mainly for the stability property, but in principle, we can apply any weight function to data analysis. Then, the question is what types of weight functions have a stability property with respect to the bottleneck or p-Wasserstein distance. Even if we do not concern about stability properties, which weight function is practically good for data analysis? Suppose generators close to the diagonal are sometimes seen as important features. Then, our statistical framework can treat such small generators as significant ones by a weight function which has large weight close to the diagonal, while other statistical methods for persistence diagrams always see small generators as noisy ones.</p></div>

To study topological properties algebraically, simplicial complexes are often considered as basic objects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Simplicial complex</head><p>We first introduce a combinatorial geometric model called simplicial complex to define homology. Let P = {1, . . . , n} be a finite set (not necessarily points in a metric space). A simplicial complex with the vertex set P is defined by a collection S of subsets in P satisfying the following properties:</p><p>1. {i} ? S for i = 1, . . . , n, and 2. if ? ? S and ? ? ?, then ? ? S.</p><p>Each subset ? with q+1 vertices is called a q-simplex. We denote the set of q-simplices by S q . A subcollection T ?

The simplicial complex obtained in this way is called a geometric realization, and its polyhedron is denoted by |S|. In this context, the simplices with small q correspond to points (q = 0), edges (q = 1), triangles (q = 2), and tetrahedra (q = 3).</p><p>Example A.1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 12</ref>  </p></div>

Given a simplicial complex S, build a chain complex C * (S). This is an algebraization of S characterizing the boundary.</p><p>2. Define homology by quotienting out certain subspaces in C * (S) characterized by the boundary.</p><p>We begin with the procedure 1 by assigning orderings on simplices. When we deal with a q-simplex ? = {i 0 , . . . , i q } as an ordered set, there are (q + 1)! orderings on ?. For q &gt; 0, we define an equivalence relation i j0 , . . . , i jq ? i 0 , . . . , i q on two orderings of ? such that they are mapped to each other by even permutations. By definition, two equivalence classes exist, and each of them is called an oriented simplex. An oriented simplex is denoted by i j0 , . . . , i jq , and its opposite orientation is expressed by adding the minus ? i j0 , . . . , i jq . We write ? = i j0 , . . . , i jq for the equivalence class including i j0 &lt; ? ? ? &lt; i jq . For q = 0, we suppose that we have only one orientation for each vertex.</p><p>Let K be a field. We construct a K-vector space C q (S) as C q (S) = Span K { ? | ? ? S q } for S q = ? and C q (S) = 0 for S q = ?. Here, Span K (A) for a set A is a vector space over K such that the elements of A formally form a basis of the vector space. Furthermore, we define a linear map called the boundary map ? q : C q (S) ? C q?1 (S) by the linear extension of ? q i 0 , . . . , i q = q =0 (?1) i 0 , . . . , i , . . . , i q ,</p><p>where i means the removal of the vertex i . We can regard the linear map ? q as algebraically capturing the (q ? 1)-dimensional boundary of a q-dimensional object. For example, the image of the 2-simplex ? = 1, 2, 3 is given by ? 2 ? = 2, 3 ? 1, 3 + 1, 2 , which is the boundary of ? (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 12</ref>).</p><p>In practice, by arranging some orderings of the oriented q-and (q ? 1)-simplices, we can represent the boundary map as a matrix M q = (M ?,? ) ??Sq?1,? ?Sq with the entry M ?,? = 0, ?1 given by the coefficient in (19). For the simplicial complex S in Example A.1, the matrix representations M 1 and M 2 of the boundary maps are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">M 2 = ? ? 1 1 ?1 ? ? , M 1 = ? ? ?1 0 ?1 1 ?1 0 0 1 1 ? ? (20)</formula><p>Here, the 1-simplices (resp. 0-simplices) are ordered by 1, 2 , 2, 3 , 1, 3 (resp. 1 , 2 , 3 ). We call a sequence of the vector spaces and linear maps ? ? ? / / C q+1 (S) ?q+1 / / C q (S) ?q / / C q?1 (S) / / ? ? ? the chain complex of S. As an easy exercise, we can show ? q ? ? q+1 = 0. Hence, the subspaces Z q (S) = ker? q and B q (S) = im? q+1 satisfy B q (S) ? Z q (S). Then, the q-th (simplicial) homology is defined by taking the quotient space H q (S) = Z q (S)/B q (S).</p><p>Intuitively, the dimension of H q (S) counts the number of q-dimensional holes in S and each generator of the vector space H q (S) corresponds to these holes. We remark that the homology as a vector space is independent of the orientations of simplices. For a subcomplex T of S, the inclusion map ? : T ? S naturally induces a linear map in homology ? q : H q (T ) ? H q (S). Namely, an element [c] ? H q (T ) is mapped to [c] ? H q (S), where the equivalence class [c] is taken in each vector space.</p><p>For example, the simplicial complex S in Example A.1 has Z 1 (S) = Span K [ 1 1 ?1 ] T = B 1 (S) from (20). Hence H 1 (S) = 0, meaning that there are no 1-dimensional hole (ring) in S. On the other hand, since Z 1 (T ) = Z 1 (S) and B 1 (T ) = 0, we have H 1 (T ) ? = K, meaning that T consists of one ring. Hence, the induced linear map ? 1 : H 1 (T ) ? H 1 (S) means that the ring in T disappears in S under T ? S. A topological space X is called triangulable if there exists a geometric realization of a simplicial complex S whose polyhedron is homeomorphic 15 to X. For such a triangulable topological space, the homology is defined by H q (X) = H q (S). This is well-defined, since a different geometric realization provides an isomorphic homology.</p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">In this setting, all homology are K-vector spaces. You may simply consider the case K = R, but the theory is built with an arbitrary field.2 A multi-set is a set with multiplicity of each point. We regard a persistence diagram as a multi-set, since several generators can have the same birth-death pairs.3 This assumption will be justified in Section 2.1.2. 4 This is called the reduced persistence diagram.</note>
